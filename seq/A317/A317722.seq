%N A317722 Number of connected graphs with n nodes and no node a member of more than one cycle.
%C A317722 The sequence counts connected, loopless, undirected graphs with cycles that do not overlap (cycles have length >= 2), which means any pair of cycles does not have common edges or nodes.
%C A317722 Examples of these graphs are the trees (A000055), the unicyclic graphs (A001429, A002094), or the graphs with cycles without chords.
%C A317722 The concept is both narrower and wider than the concept for Husimi trees, because cycles in Husimi trees may share nodes (but not edges), and because cycles in Husimi trees need to have length >= 3.
%C A317722 There is a mapping/contraction of these graphs to trees: replace each cycle by a single node, attaching all edges that enter a node in the cycle to that node. That tree associated with the graph could be called the skeleton tree.
%C A317722 By reversing that surjection of the graphs to trees, we may generate our graphs with non-overlapping cycles by generating the set of weighted trees (A303841) and replacing the nodes by cycles of lengths that equals their weight.
