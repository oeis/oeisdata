%N A317102 Powerful numbers whose distinct prime multiplicities are pairwise indivisible.
%C A317102 In other words powerful numbers whose canonical prime factorization has no exponent that is a proper multiple of another exponent. - _Peter Munn_, Nov 04 2025
%C A317102 A number is powerful if its prime multiplicities are all greater than 1. Equivalently, if the number is divisible by the square of each of its prime divisors.

%e A317102 144 = 2^4 * 3^2 is not in the sequence because 4 and 2 are distinct and not pairwise indivisible, as 4 is a proper multiple of 2. Similar cases are any number with canonical prime factorization p^4*q^3*r^2, such as 10800, or p^4*q^5*r^2. Such numbers are not in the sequence.
%e A317102 36 = 2^2*3^2 is in the sequence as both exponents are 2, so neither exponent is a proper multiple of the other.
