%N A235125 The rounded sum-connectivity index of the rooted tree with Matula number n (n >= 2).
%C A235125 The sum-connectivity index of a graph is defined as the summation of 1/sqrt((d(u)+d(v))) over all edges uv of G, where d(w) denotes the degree of the vertex w.
%C A235125 The Matula number of a rooted tree can be defined in the following recursive manner: to the one-vertex tree there corresponds the number 1; to a tree T with root degree 1 there corresponds the t-th prime number, where t is the Matula  number of the tree obtained from T by deleting the edge emanating from the root; to a tree T with root degree m>=2 there corresponds the product of the Matula numbers of the m branches of T.

%F A235125 There are recurrence relations that give the sum-connectivity index of an "elevated" rooted tree (attach a new vertex to the root which becomes the root of the new tree) and of the merge of two rooted trees (identify the two roots). They make use of the sequence of the degrees of the level-1 vertices (denoted by DL in the Maple program) .
%F A235125 In the Maple program, F(n) gives the actual (not rounded)  sum-connectivity index of the rooted tree with Matula number n. For example, F(7) = 3/2; indeed, to the Matula number 7 there corresponds the star with 4 vertices, having 3 edges, each with endpoint degrees 1 and 3; then the index is 3/sqrt(4) = 3/2.
%e A235125 a(5)=2; indeed the rooted tree with Matula number 5 is the path PQRS (rooted at P). The edges PQ and RS have endpoints of degrees 1 and 2 and the edge QR has endpoints of degrees 2 and 2; consequently, the contributions of these 3 edges to the sum-connectivity index are 1/sqrt(3), 1/sqrt(3), and 1/2, respectively; the sum-connectivity index is 2/sqrt(3) + 1/2 =1.6547.
