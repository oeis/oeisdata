%N A235491 Self-inverse permutation of natural numbers: complementary pair ludic/nonludic numbers (A003309/A192607) entangled with the same pair in the opposite order, nonludic/ludic. See Formula.
%C A235491 The permutation is self-inverse (an involution), meaning that a(a(n)) = n for all n.
%H A235491 Antti Karttunen, <a href="/A235491/b235491.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 0..74</a> (The terms after a(32) were computed with the help of 100000 term b-file uploaded by Donovan Johnson for A003309.)

%F A235491 a(0)=0, a(1)=1, and for n > 1, if n is k-th ludic number (i.e., n = A003309(k)), then a(n) = nonludic(a(k-1)); otherwise, when n is k-th nonludic number (i.e., n = A192607(k)), then a(n) = ludic(a(k)+1), where ludic numbers are given by A003309, and nonludic numbers by A192607.
%F A235491 a(0)=0, a(1)=1, and for n > 1, if A192490(n)=1 (n is ludic) a(n) = A192607(a(A192512(n)-1)); otherwise (n is nonludic), a(n) = A003309(1+(a(A236863(n)))).
%e A235491 For n=2, with 2 being the second ludic number (= A003309(4)), the value is computed as nonludic(a(2-1)) = nonludic(a(1)) = 4, the first nonludic number, thus a(2) = 4.
%e A235491 For n=5, with 5 being the fourth ludic number (= A003309(4)), the value is computed as nonludic(a(4-1)) = nonludic(a(3)) = nonludic(9) = 16, thus a(5) = 16.
%e A235491 For n=6, with 6 being the second nonludic number (= A192607(2)), the value is computed as ludic(a(2)+1) = ludic(4+1) = ludic(5) = 7, thus a(6) = 7.
