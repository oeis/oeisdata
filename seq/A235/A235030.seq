%N A235030 Numbers such that A235027(A235027(n)) <> n; Numbers which are divisible by any of the odd terms of A204219.
%C A235030 Sequence consists of all the primes in A204219 (after 2), together with all of their multiples.
%C A235030 Note that this is not the same as the numbers that do not occur in A235027 ("Garden of Eden" numbers for A235027), a subsequence of this sequence, which begins as: 19, 38, 57, 59, 76, 79, 89, 95, 103, 109, 114, 118, 133, 137, 139, 149, 152, 157, 158, 171, 177, 178, 179, 190, 191, 206, 211, 218, 228, 236, 237, 239, 241, 266, 267, 271, 274, 278, 281, 285, 293, 298, 304, 309, 311, 314, 316, 317, 327, 342, 347, 354, 356, 358, ...
%C A235030 The first term that occurs in this sequence, but not in the "GoE"-sequence is a(27)=209, as a(139) = 209 = 11*19 and 139 = A235146(2), the least integer which requires two steps to reach a fixed point or 2-cycle.
%C A235030 Both the above "GoE"-sequence, and its differences from this will be submitted later.
