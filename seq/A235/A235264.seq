%F A235264 Numbers n such that 2-adic m = -1/n exists and 2-adic product m*n involves no carries.
%F A235264 Conjecturally, a(n) = (2^k-1)/m where k, m >= 1, and base-2 product m*a(n) involves no carries. Confirmed for a(n) <= 2^20.
%F A235264 Conjecturally, a(n) is of the form PROD 2^(d_i*b_i)-1)/(2^b_i-1) where d_i >= 1, b_i >= 2, and d_i*b_i | d_(i+1). Confirmed for a(n) <= 2^20.
%F A235264 First conjecture is equivalent to the 2-adic definition. - _Charlie Neder_, Nov 04 2018
%F A235264 Second conjecture is true, see Neder link. - _Charlie Neder_, Dec 04 2018
%e A235264 n = 3855 has 2-adic representation .10100000101, and negative reciprocal repeating 2-adic m = .(1100110000000000)...  The 2-adic product n*m = -1 = .(1)... involves no carries, so n is tileable.
