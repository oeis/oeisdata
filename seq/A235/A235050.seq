%N A235050 Squarefree numbers such that none of their prime factors share common 1-bits in the same bit-position of their binary representations.
%C A235050 a(1)=1 is included on the grounds that it has no prime factors at all, thus no conflicting 1-bits.
%C A235050 After a(1)=1 all n such that A001414(n) = A072593(n), or equally, A001414(n) = A072594(n).
%C A235050 Union of noncomposites (A008578) and semiprimes of the form 2*A002144 (cf. also A235490).
