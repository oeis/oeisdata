%N A235524 Primitive refactorable (or tau) numbers: refactorable numbers which are not part of any family.
%C A235524 To be "primitive", the set of prime factors of N and of d(N) must be identical, otherwise any prime only in N is arbitrary and this defines a family of refactorable numbers.  These are referred to as generators in the Zelinsky reference.
%C A235524 This sequence is therefore the intersection of the refactorable numbers (A033950) and those numbers with identical sets of prime factors for N and d(N) (A081381).
%C A235524 The first numbers in A081381 which are not in this sequence are 486, 768, 8748, and 303750.  This sequence is A235525.

%e A235524 720 is in the sequence since 720 = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5^1, therefore the prime decomposition of d(720) is 5 * 3 * 2 and each prime in 720 is required to make it refactorable.
