%N A235034 Numbers whose prime divisors, when multiplied together without carry-bits (as encodings of GF(2)[X]-polynomials, with A048720), produce the original number; numbers for which A234741(n) = n.
%C A235034 If n is present, then 2n is present also, as shifting binary representation left never produces any carries.

%e A235034 All primes occur in this sequence as no multiplication -> no need to add any intermediate products -> no carry bits produced.
%e A235034 Composite numbers like 15 are also present, as 15 = 3*5, and when these factors (with binary representations '11' and '101') are multiplied as:
%e A235034    101
%e A235034   1010
%e A235034   ----
%e A235034   1111 = 15
%e A235034 we see that the intermediate products 1*5 and 2*5 can be added together without producing any carry-bits (as they have no 1-bits in the same columns/bit-positions), so A048720(3,5) = 3*5 and thus 15 is included in this sequence.

%Y A235034 Gives the positions of zeros in A236378, i.e., n such that A234741(n) = n.
%Y A235034 Intersection with A235035 gives A235032.
