%C A235061 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 8.
%C A235061 (ii) Any integer n > 100 can be written as k^2 + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that phi(k^2) + prime(m) is prime.
%C A235061 (iii) Any integer n > 187 can be written as k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that prime(k) + phi(m) is a triangular number. Also, each integer n > 45 can be written as k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that prime(k) + phi(m)/2 is a triangular number.
%C A235061 (iv)  Any integer n > 293 can be written as k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that prime(k) + phi(m) is a square. Also, each integer n > 83 can be written as k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that prime(k) + phi(m)/2 is a square.

%e A235061 a(10) = 1 since 10 = 2*(2+1)/2 + 7 = 3 + 7 with prime(3) + phi(7) = 5 + 6 = 11 prime.
%e A235061 a(20) = 1 since 20 = 3*(3+1)/2 + 14 = 6 + 14 with prime(6) + phi(14) = 13 + 6 = 19 prime.
%e A235061 a(86) = 1 since 86 = 12*(12+1)/2 + 8 = 78 + 8 with prime(78) + phi(8) = 397 + 4 = 401 prime.
