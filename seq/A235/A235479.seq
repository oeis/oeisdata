%N A235479 Primes whose base-2 representation also is the base-9 representation of a prime.
%C A235479 This sequence is part of a two-dimensional array of sequences, given in the LINK, based on this same idea for any two different bases b, c > 1. Sequence A235265 and A235266 are the most elementary ones in this list. Sequences A089971, A089981 and A090707 through A090721, and sequences A065720 - A065727, follow the same idea with one base equal to 10.
%C A235479 For further motivation and cross-references, see sequence A235265 which is the main entry for this whole family of sequences.
%C A235479 A subsequence of A027697, A050150, A062090 and A176620.

%e A235479 11 = 1011_2 and 1011_9 = 6571 are both prime, so 11 is a term.
