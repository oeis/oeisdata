%N A235343 a(n) = |{0 < k < n: f(n,k) - 1, f(n,k) + 1 and q(f(n,k)) + 1 are all prime with f(n,k) = phi(k) + phi(n-k)/4}|, where phi(.) is Euler's totient function, and q(.) is the strict partition function (A000009).
%C A235343 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n >= 60.
%C A235343 (ii) For any integer n > 1234, there is a positive integer k < n such that g(n,k) - 1, g(n,k) + 1 and q(g(n,k)) - 1 are all prime, where g(n,k) = phi(k) + phi(n-k)/8.
%C A235343 Clearly, part (i) implies that there are infinitely many primes of the form q(m) + 1 with m - 1 and m + 1 also prime, and part (ii) implies that there are infinitely many primes of the form q(m) - 1 with m - 1 and m + 1 also prime. As log q(m) is asymptotically equivalent to  pi*sqrt(m/3), the conjecture is much stronger than the twin prime conjecture.
%C A235343 We have verified parts (i) and (ii) for n up to 100000 and 60000 respectively.
