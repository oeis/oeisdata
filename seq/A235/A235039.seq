%N A235039 Odd numbers which are factored to the same set of primes in Z as to the irreducible polynomials in GF(2)[X]; odd terms of A235036.
%C A235039 These are odd nonprime numbers in A235032. After a(0)=1, the odd composite numbers in A235032.
%C A235039 The terms a(1) - a(42) are all semiprimes. Presumably terms with a larger number of prime factors also exist.
%e A235039 111 = 3*37. When these two prime factors (both terms of A091206), with binary representations '11' and '100101', are multiplied as:
%e A235039    100101
%e A235039   1001010
%e A235039   -------
%e A235039   1101111 = 111 in decimal
%e A235039 we see that the intermediate products 1*37 and 2*37 can be added together without producing any carry-bits (as they have no 1-bits in the same columns/bit-positions), so A048720(3,37) = 3*37 and thus 111 is included in this sequence.
%e A235039 Note that unlike in A235040, 15 = 3*5 is not included in this sequence, because its prime factor 5 is not in A091206, but instead decomposes further as A048720(3,3).
