%N A212659 Good's example of a "Standard List" of prime words over the alphabet {1,2}.
%C A212659 This is just one possible ordering of the list, given by Good in his Table 1. There are A001037(n) words of length n in the list, and they can be arranged in A001037(n)! ways. However, changing the order would also change the individual entries.
%C A212659 This sequence is well-defined only in the sense that it is in the order chosen by Good, who gives the 71 words of length <= 8. The sequence must be regarded as being undefined beyond that point.
%C A212659 For the rules that the list must satisfy, see pages 28-31 of Good.
