%N A212319 The number of abstract groups with minimal permutation representations of degree n.
%C A212319 a(n) can be derived by setting a(1)=1 and then taking the differences between the consecutive elements of A174511. This is due to the fact that if an abstract group can be represented as a permutation group on n points, then it can also be represented by a permutation group of degree n+1, simply by including a fixed point. In other words, the sum of the first n terms give you the number of isomorphism classes of subgroups of the symmetric group of degree n.
%F A212319 a(1)=1, a(n) =  A174511(n) -  A174511(n-1), n>1.
%e A212319 a(1)=1, since only the trivial group 1 can be represented as permutations of a single point. a(2)=1 because Z_2,1 can both be realized by permutations of two points but for 1 this representation is not minimal. a(3)=2 with Z_3 and S_3 appearing for the first time.
%Y A212319 Cf. A174511.
