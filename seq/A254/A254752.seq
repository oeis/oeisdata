%N A254752 Composite numbers such that, in base 10, all their proper prefixes and suffixes represent composites.
%C A254752 A proper prefix (or suffix) of a number m is one which is neither void, nor identical to m.
%C A254752 Alternative definition: Slicing the decimal expansion of the composite number a(n) in any way into two nonempty parts, each part represents a composite number.
%C A254752 This list is infinite because any string of two or more digits selected from {4,6,8} is a member.
%C A254752 It is a subsequence of A254750 and shares with it these properties: Each member of a(n) must start, as well as end, with one of the digits {4,6,8,9}. Every proper prefix of each member a(n) is a member of A202260, and every proper suffix is a member of A254755.

%e A254752 6 is not a member because its expansion cannot be sliced in two.
%e A254752 The composite 469 is a member because it is a composite and the slices (4, 69, 46, and 9) are all composites.

%o A254752 slicesIntoComposites(n,b=10) = {my(k=b);if(n<b,return(0););while(n\k>0,if(!isComposite(n\k)||!isComposite(n%k),return(0););k*=b);return(1);}
