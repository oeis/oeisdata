%N A254211 Number of length n 1..3 arrays with no leading or trailing partial sum equal to a prime and no consecutive values equal.
%C A254211 These are vectors [u_1 ... u_n] such that
%C A254211 (i)   u_i = 1,2 or 3,
%C A254211 (ii)  u_i != u_{i+1},
%C A254211 (iii) Sum_{i=1..k} u_i != prime for k=1..n,
%C A254211 (iv)  Sum_{i=k..n} u_i != prime for k=1..n.
%C A254211 Conjecture: There are infinitely many n > 0 with a(n) > 0. - _Alois P. Heinz_, Jan 27 2015
