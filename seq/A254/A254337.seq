%N A254337 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct numbers such that no sum of consecutive terms is prime.
%C A254337 In other words, no sum a(i)+a(i+1)+a(i+2)+...+a(n) may be prime. In particular, the sequence may not contain any primes.
%C A254337 I conjecture that the sequence contains all even numbers > 2 and no odd number beyond 1. If so, we must simply ensure that the sum a(1)+...+a(n) is not prime, which is always possible for one of the three consecutive even numbers {2n, 2n+2, 2n+4}. As a consequence, it would follow that a(n) ~ 2n.
%C A254337 Is there even a proof that the smallest odd composite number, 9, does not appear?
%C A254337 The variant A254341 has the additional restriction of alternating parity, which avoids excluding the odd numbers.
%C A254337 The least odd composite number a'(n+1) that could occur as the next term after a(n) and such that sum(a(i),i=k...n)+a'(n+1) is composite for all k <= n is (for n = 0, 1, 2,...): 9, 9, 25, 21, 39, 25, 69, 65, 45, 119, 95, 77, 55, 27, 595, 561, 531, 865, 1519, 1479, 1437, 1391, 1353, 1309, 1257, 1209, 1155, 1105, 1047, 2317, 2255, 2191, 3565, 5719, 13067, 12995, 12925, 12851, 12771, 12695, 12617, 12531, 12449, 12365, 12275, ... The growth of this sequence shows how it is increasingly unlikely that an odd number could occur, since the next possible even term is only about 2n.

%F A254337 It appears that a(n) ~ 2n.
%e A254337 To explain the beginning of the sequence, observe that starting with the smallest possible terms 0, 1 does not appear to lead to a contradiction (and in fact never does), so we start there.
%e A254337 The next composite would be 4 but 1+4=5 is prime, as is 1+6, but 1+8=9 is not, so we take a(2) = 8 to be the next term.
%e A254337 4 is impossible for a(3) since 1+8+4=13 is prime, but neither 1+8+6=15 nor 8+6 is prime, so a(3)=6.
