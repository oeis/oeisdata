%N A254885 Number of ways to write n as the sum of two squares and a positive triangular number.
%C A254885 We have shown that a(n) > 0 for all n > 0. In fact, if n is a positive triangular number T(x) = x*(x+1)/2, then n = 0^2 + 0^2 + T(x); if n > 0 is not a triangular number, then by Theorem 1(ii) of the reference of Sun in 2007, there are nonnegative integers a,b,c,u,v,w such that n = a^2 + b^2 + T(c) = u^2 + v^2 + T(w) with a + b odd and u + v even, hence c and w cannot both be zero.
%C A254885 This result is stronger than Euler's observation that any nonnegative integer can be written as the sum of two squares and a triangular number. We have also proved that any positive integer can be written as the sum of a positive square and two triangular numbers.
