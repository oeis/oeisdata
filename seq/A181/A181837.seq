%N A181837 T(n,k) = [k is strongly prime to n], the indicator function of strong coprimality, triangle read by rows.
%C A181837 k is strongly prime to n iff k is relatively prime to n and k does not divide n-1.
%C A181837 T(n,k) = [k is strong prime to n] where [] denotes the Iverson bracket.

%e A181837 Let n = 5 then the numbers prime to n are {1, 2, 3, 4} and the positive divisors of n-1 are {1, 2, 4}. Thus only 3 is strong prime to 5.
