%N A181930 Triangle T(d,k), where T(d,k)/lcm(1..d) gives the probability that d is the k-th divisor of an integer.
%C A181930 By probability is meant limit density on [1,n] as n grows without bound.
%C A181930 Equivalently, T(d,k) is lcm(1..d) times the asymptotic density of the numbers whose k-th divisor is d.

%F A181930 T(d,d) = 1.
%F A181930 T(d,k) = 0 if k < tau(d) = A000005(d). (If d is a divisor of m, then every divisor of d is a divisor of m, and d is therefore at least the tau(d)-th divisor of m.)
%F A181930 T(d,k) > 0 for k with tau(d) <= k <= d. [Appears to have been submitted on basis of a faulty proof. - _Peter Munn_, May 22 2025]
%F A181930 Sum_{d>=k} T(d,k)/lcm(1..d) = 1.
%F A181930 Sum_{k=1..d} T(d,k)/lcm(1..d) = 1/d.
%F A181930 T(d,tau(d)) = (lcm(1..d)/d) * Product_{q prime and there is an a with q^a < d and q^a does not divide d} (q-1)/q. In particular, if p is prime, then T(p,2) = (lcm(1..p)/p) * Product_{q prime and q < d} (q-1)/q. - _Benoit Jubin_, Apr 02 2012
%e A181930 T(5,4) = 3. T(5,4)/lcm(1..5) = 3/60 = 1/20 is the probability that 5 is the 4th divisor of an integer.
