%N A181825 Members of A025487 whose prime signature is self-conjugate (as a partition).
%C A181825 A025487(n) is included iff A025487(n) = A181822(n).
%C A181825 Closed under the binary operations of GCD and LCM, since a self-conjugate partition of Omega(a(n)) (which the prime signature of these numbers is) is the concatenation of self-conjugate hooks of decreasing size while moving downward and to the right in the Ferrers diagram, and the GCD (or LCM) of two terms a(i) and a(j) is obtained by taking the smaller (or larger, respectively) of the corresponding hooks. For example, GCD(a(8),a(11)) = GCD(5040,36960) = 1680 = a(7), and LCM(a(8),a(11)) = 110880 = a(13). The two binary operations make the set {a(n)} into a lattice order. - _Richard Peterson_, May 29 2020
