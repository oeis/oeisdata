%N A181808 Numbers that set a record for number of even divisors: a(n) = 2*A002182(n).
%C A181808 In other words, a positive integer n appears in the sequence iff more even numbers divide n than divide any positive integer smaller than n.
%C A181808 For all positive integer values (j,k) such that jk = n, the number of divisors of n that are multiples of j equals A000005(k). Therefore, n sets a record for the number of its divisors that are multiples of j iff k=n/j is highly composite (A002182). Cf. A181803, A181809, A181810.

%F A181808 a(n)=2*A002182(n).
%e A181808 a(4)=12 has exactly four even divisors (2, 4, 6 and 12).  (Note that these are precisely the numbers that are twice a divisor of A002182(4)=6; see row 6 of A027750.)  No positive integer smaller than 12 has as many as four even divisors; hence, 12 is a member of the sequence.
%Y A181808 Numbers n such that 2 appears in row n of A181803. See also A181809, A181810.
%Y A181808 A002183(n) gives number of even divisors of a(n).
%Y A181808 A053624 gives numbers that set records for number of odd divisors. No number sets records both for its number of odd divisors and its number of even divisors.
