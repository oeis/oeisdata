%N A181602 Primes p such that p-1 is a semiprime and p+2 is prime or prime squared.
%C A181602 Except for the second term, a(n)+1 is divisible by 6.
%C A181602 [Proof: a(n)=p is a prime, with p-1=q*r and two primes q<=r by definition. Omitting the special case p=2, p is odd, p+1 is even, so p+1=q*r+2 = 2(1+q*r/2). To show that p+1 is divisible by 6 we show that it is divisible by 2 and by 3; divisibility by 2 has already been shown in the previous sentence. (1+q*r/2 must be integer, so q*r/2 must be integer, so the smaller prime q of the semiprime must be q=2, so p=2*r+1. This shows that p=a(n) are a subset of A005383.) First subcase of the definition is that p+2 is also prime. Then p is a smaller twin prime and by a comment in A003627, p+1 is divisible by 3. Second subcase of the definition is that p+2 = s^2 with s a prime. s can be 3*k+1 or 3*k+2 --p=7 is the exception-- which leads to s^2 = 9*k^2+6*k+1 or s^2=9*k^2+12*k+4, so p+1 = 9*k^2+6*k or 9*k^2+12*k+3, and in both cases p+1 is divisible by 3.]
%C A181602 In consequence, except for the first three terms, first differences a(n+1)-a(n) are also divisible by 6.
