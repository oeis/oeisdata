%N A181597 (N\{4})-perfect numbers, i.e., numbers m for which sigma(m)-4 = 2m, if 4|m, otherwise sigma(m) = 2m.
%C A181597 Or union of {6}, near-perfect numbers m (cf. A181595) for which d(m)=4, and all odd perfect numbers (if they exist). Note that (N\{2})-perfect numbers are numbers for which sigma(m)-2=2m, if m is even, and sigma(m)=2m, if m is odd. They are all even numbers of A045768 and all odd perfect numbers (if they exist).
%C A181597 Besides odd perfect numbers (if they exist), this sequence is formed by 6 followed by the multiples of 4 from A088832. - _Max Alekseyev_, Sep 02 2025
%e A181597 88 is in the sequence since sigma(88) = 180 and 180 - 4 = 2*88.
