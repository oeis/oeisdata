%N A181501 Triangle read by rows: number of solutions of n queens problem for given n and given number of connection components of conflict constellation.
%C A181501 The rightmost part of the triangle contains only zeros. As any connection component needs at least two queens, the number of connection components of a solution is always less than or equal to n.

%e A181501 for n=4, there are only the two solutions 2-4-1-3 and 3-1-4-2. Both have two connection components in the conflicts graph. So, the terms for n=4 are 0, 0, 2 (the two cited above), 0 and 0. These are members 10 to 15 of the sequence.
%Y A181501 Cf. A000170, A007705, A181499, A181500, A181502.
