%F A181499 Row sum = A000170 (number of n queens placements)
%F A181499 Column 0 has same values as A007705 (torus n queens solutions)
%F A181499 Column 1 is always zero.
%e A181499 For n=4, there are only the two solutions 2-4-1-3 and 3-1-4-2. Both have two conflicts So the terms for n=4 are 0 (0 solutions for n=4 having 0 conflicts), 0, 2 (the two cited above), 0 and 0. These are members 10 to 15 of the sequence.
%Y A181499 Cf. A000170, A007705, A181500, A181501, A181502.
