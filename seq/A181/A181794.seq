%N A181794 Numbers n such that the number of even divisors of n is an even divisor of n.
%C A181794 All terms are even, since odd numbers, even if they have an even count of divisors, don't have any even divisors.
%C A181794 Includes all numbers of the form A000040(m)*A001146(n).

%e A181794 a(4)=12 has four even divisors (2, 4, 6, and 12), and 4 is one of those even divisors.
%e A181794 The number 21 is not in this sequence: it has four divisors (1, 3, 7, and 21), and 4 is not one of those divisors.
