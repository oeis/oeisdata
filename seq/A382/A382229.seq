%N A382229 a(0) = 1; thereafter a(n) is the next larger number that compared to the previous term differs by +-1 in the number of prime factors counted with multiplicity.
%C A382229 a(n+1) is the least integer k > a(n) such that abs(bigomega(k) - bigomega(a(n))) = 1.
%C A382229 Do an infinite number of primes appear in the sequence?

%F A382229 a(n) = A071192(a(n-1)). - _Pontus von Brömssen_, Mar 21 2025
%e A382229 Example: 52 = 2*2*13 is a term. 53 is not a term because it has -2 prime factors compared to 52. 54 = 2*3*3*3 is a term because it has +1 factor compared to 52. 55 = 5*11 is not a term because it has -2 factors compared to 54. 56 is not a term because it has the same number of factors as 54.
