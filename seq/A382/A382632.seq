%N A382632 Numbers k such that one can make an equilateral triangle from a chain of linked rods of length 1, 2, 3, ..., k, with perimeter equal to the total length.
%C A382632 For all known terms (n<359), there is only one solution, except for 125, 158949, and 31626125 which all have 2 solutions.
%C A382632 We observe that:
%C A382632 1) The perimeter of the triangle is a triangular number. When looking at it modulo 9, it can only be congruent to 0, 1, 3 or 6.
%C A382632 2) A perimeter congruent to 1 cannot be divided into 3 equal parts. Therefore the perimeter is a multiple of 3.
%C A382632 3) At least 2 sides (S1, S2) are the sum of consecutive numbers. The third side (S3) can be the sum of 2 sequences of consecutive numbers.
%C A382632 4) If S1 is congruent to 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 or 8 modulo 9, it can be shown that S2 cannot have the same congruence.
%C A382632 Therefore, the length of each side is a multiple of 3, and the perimeter is a multiple of 9.
%C A382632 Since the perimeter is k*(k+1)/2, either k or k+1 is a multiple of 9. So k is congruent to 0 or 8 modulo 9.
%C A382632 Conjecture: Out of some linked rods of length 1, 2...k, we can fold them in half (digon), or make equilateral triangles, but no other regular polygons (squares, regular pentagons, etc...) can be made.

%e A382632 For k=9, the sides of the triangle are 15 in length: [4+5+6], [7+8] and [9+1+2+3]. Therefore 9 is in the sequence.
%e A382632 For k=90, the sides of the triangle are 1365 in length: [16+...+54], [55+...+75] and [76+...+90 + 1+...+15]. Therefore 90 is in the sequence.
%e A382632 The 2 solutions for 125 are:
%e A382632     [3+4+...+71+72], [73+74+...+101+102] and [103+104+...+124+125 +1+2]
%e A382632 and [58+...+92], [93+...+117] and [118+...+125 + 1+...+58], all sides 2625 in length.
