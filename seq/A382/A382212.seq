%N A382212 Number of labeled Eulerian oriented graphs with n nodes without isolated vertices.
%C A382212 This sequence is similar to A007081 but imposes the restriction that the graphs contain no isolated vertices.
%C A382212 Each graph can be considered to represent a generalized rock-paper-scissors game for which a uniformly random strategy is optimal and no draw can be forced.

%F A382212 a(n) = Sum_{k=0..n} (-1)^(n-k) * binomial(n,k) * A007081(k). - _Max Alekseyev_, Oct 25 2025
%e A382212 For n=3, the only solutions are given by the directed cycles (1,2,3) and (1,3,2). Similarly, also n=4 only has directed cycles as solutions.
%e A382212 An example of a solution for n=5 is
%e A382212   1 -> {5}
%e A382212   2 -> {5}
%e A382212   3 -> {4}
%e A382212   4 -> {1,2}
%e A382212   5 -> {3,4}
%e A382212 Disconnected solutions exist only for n >= 6.
%Y A382212 Cf. A007081.
