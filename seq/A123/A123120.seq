%N A123120 Numbers k>0 such that m+k is not the sum of m nonzero squares for any m>5.
%C A123120 Also, numbers which are not the sum of "squares-minus-1" (cf. A005563). - _Benoit Jubin_, Apr 14 2010
%C A123120 Conjecture: All but (n+6) positive numbers are equal to the sum of n>5 nonzero squares. For all n>5 the only (n+6) positive numbers that are not equal to the sum of n nonzero squares are {1,2,3,...,n-3,n-2,n-1,n+1,n+2,n+4,n+5,n+7,n+10,n+13}.

%C A123120   Numbers that are not the sum of 5 nonzero squares (n=5): A047701 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 33}.
%C A123120   Numbers that are not the sum of 6 nonzero squares (n=6): {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 16, 19}.

%C A123120 The above conjecture appears as Theorem 2 on p. 73 in the Grosswald reference, where it is attributed to E. Dubouis (1911). - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Mar 27 2013
