%N A123506 Sequence generated from the second nontrivial zero of the Riemann zeta function.
%C A123506 A123504 performs an analogous set of operations using the first nontrivial zero. A123507 records the lengths of runs in this sequence.
%C A123506 Let z = (1/2 + i*t), t = 21.0220396387... (the second nontrivial Riemann zeta function zero). Perform (1/n)^z, (n = 2, 3, 4, ...) extracting the argument. If the argument is between 0 and 180 degrees, a(n) = 1, otherwise a(n) = 0.

%e A123506 a(7) = 1 since (1/7)^z = (0.37796447..., angle 176.201... degrees) and the argument is between 0 and 180 degrees.
