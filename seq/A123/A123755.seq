%N A123755 a(0)=1. a(n) = number of earlier terms which are divisible by (the number of 1's in the binary representation of n).
%e A123755 9 in binary is 1001, which has 2 ones. So a(9) is the number of terms, from a(0) to a(8), which are divisible by 2. a(2)=2, a(4)=4, a(5)=2 and a(8)=8 are the four earlier terms divisible by 2. So a(9) = 4.
