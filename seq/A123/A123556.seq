%N A123556 Number of elements in longest possible arithmetic progression of primes with difference n.
%C A123556 Length of n-th row of A124064.
%C A123556 The corresponding smallest term of the first such longest possible arithmetic progression of primes with common difference n is A342309(n). - _Bernard Schott_, Oct 12 2021
%C A123556 From _Bernard Schott_, Feb 24 2023: (Start)
%C A123556 For every positive integer n, there exists a smallest prime p that does not divide n = A053669(n); then, an AP of k primes with common difference n cannot contain more terms than this value of p so k <= p, moreover, the longest possible APs of primes have p-1 or p elements.
%C A123556 Proof: consider the AP of p elements (q, q+n, q+2*n, q+3*n, ..., q+(p-1)*n) with common difference n, q prime and p is the smallest prime that does not divide n; the modular arithmetic modulo p gives this set of remainders with p elements: {0, 1, 2, ..., p-1}, so there is always a multiple of p in each such AP with p terms, hence length k of longest possible AP of primes is >= p-1 and <= p.
%C A123556 Moreover, when the longest possible AP contains k = p elements, then this unique longest AP must start with p (corresponding to remainder = 0) and the common difference n is a multiple of A151799(p)# and not of p#, where # = primorial = A002110.
%C A123556 Now, always with a common difference n, when the longest possible AP contains k = p-1 elements, these longest APs with p-1 primes can start with p or with another prime q != p, and there are infinitely many such longest APs with p-1 terms (see Properties in Wikipedia link) in this case. When this AP starts with p, the set of remainders is {0, 1, ..., p-2} and when this AP starts with q, then the set of remainders becomes {1, 2, ..., p-1}.
%C A123556 Terms are ordered without repetition in A173919. (End)

%e A123556 For n = 12, p = A053669(12) = 5 and the AP (5, 17, 29, 41, 53) has 5 elements that are primes (the next should be 65 = 5*13), so a(12) = 5. This AP is the unique longest possible AP of primes with a common difference n = 12.
