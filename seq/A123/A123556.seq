%N A123556 Number of elements in longest arithmetic progression of primes with difference n.
%C A123556 Length of n-th row of A124064.
%C A123556 The corresponding smallest term of the first such longest arithmetic progression of primes with difference n is A342309(n). - _Bernard Schott_, Oct 12 2021
%F A123556 Assume the k-tuples conjecture. Let p = A053669(n). If the arithmetic progression of p elements starting at p with difference n consists of primes, then a(n) = p, otherwise a(n) = p-1.
%F A123556 a(n) = 1 iff n is in A007921. - _Bernard Schott_, Oct 12 2021
%F A123556 a(n) = 2 if n is in A040976 \ {0}. - _Bernard Schott_, Oct 16 2021
