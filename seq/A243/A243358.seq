%N A243358 The densest possibly infinite sequence of primes of the form a(n) = floor[A^(C^n)] for A < 2. The density parameter C here approaches its minimal possible value C_0 = 1.2209864... (A117739), while the corresponding value of A is 1.8252076... (A243370).
%C A243358 Double-checked by David J. Broadhurst. Terms from a(61) to a(67) from David J. Broadhurst. Terms after a(52) are strong probable primes.
%C A243358 It is very likely, but not yet proved, that the sequence is infinite. However, it is clear that for density parameter C < C_0 = 1.2209864... (see A117739) such a sequence must contain nonprime terms.

%F A243358 Once the terms up to the prime 223 are known, the following algorithm works:
%F A243358 1. assign P:=(the largest prime currently in the sequence)
%F A243358 2. assign k:=(the distance between 83 and P in the sequence)
%F A243358 3. assign C:=(logP/log84)^(1/k)
%F A243358 4. assign P:=P^C
%F A243358 5. if floor[P] is prime, add it to the sequence and go to 4
%F A243358 6. add nextprime[P] to the sequence and go to 1
%F A243358 That algorithm gives heuristically as many terms as needed because the increment of C at step 3 becomes so tiny that the values of 84^(C^n) for n < k don't jump over integers anymore (although there's no proof).
%F A243358 So we have a(n) = floor[(84-0)^(C_0^(n-10))], where C_0 = 1.2209864... (see A117739), and "84-0" notation means that when C approaches C_0 from above, the necessary value of A brings A^(C^10) to 84 from below.
