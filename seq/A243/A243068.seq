%N A243068 Fixed points of A242420.
%C A243068 A number n is present if its prime factorization n = p_a * p_b * p_c * ... * p_i * p_j * p_k^e_k, where a <= b <= c <= ... <= i <= j < k are the indices of prime factors, not necessarily all distinct, except that j < k, and the greatest prime divisor p_k [with k = A061395(n)] may occur multiple times, satisfies the condition that the first differences of those prime indices (a-0, b-a, c-b, ..., j-i, k-j) form a palindrome.

%e A243068 4 = p_1^2 is present, as the first differences (deltas) of the prime indices (excluding the extra copies of the largest prime factor 2), form a palindrome: (1-0) = (1).
%e A243068 18 = 2*3*3 = p_1 * p_2 * p_2 is present, as the deltas of the indices of its nondistinct prime factors, (excluding the extra copies of the largest prime factor 3) form a palindrome: (1-0, 2-1) = (1,1).
%e A243068 60 = 2*2*3*5 = p_1 * p_1 * p_2 * p_3 is NOT present, as the deltas of prime indices (1-0, 1-1, 2-1, 3-2) = (1,0,1,1) do NOT form a palindrome.
%e A243068 Also, any of the cases mentioned in the Example section of A243058 as being present there, are also present in this sequence.
