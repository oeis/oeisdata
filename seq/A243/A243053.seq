%N A243053 Integer sequence induced by third-order Bulgarian solitaire operation on partition list A241918: a(n) = A241909(A243073(A241909(n))).
%C A243053 The usual (first-order) Bulgarian Solitaire operation (cf. A243051) applied to an unordered integer partition means: subtract one from each part, and add a new part as large as there were parts in the old partition.
%C A243053 The "Second-Order Bulgarian Operation" means that after subtracting one from each part of the old partition (and discarding the parts that diminished to zero), we apply the (first-order) Bulgarian operation to the remaining partition before adding a new part as large as there were parts in the original partition.
%C A243053 Similarly, in "Third-Order Bulgarian Solitaire Operation", we apply the Second-Order Bulgarian operation to the remaining partition (after we have subtracted one from each part) before adding a new part as large as there were parts in the original partition.
%C A243053 How the partitions are encoded in this case, see A241918.
