%N A276435 Smallest integer z > 1 that satisfies all the integer congruences z mod i = b(i) mod i, where b(i) is the i-th composite between prime(k) and prime(k+1), 0 < i < prime(k+1) - prime(k) - 1, and k > 1 is the smallest integer not used by previous terms of the sequence.
%C A276435 1) All lists of consecutive composites are checked in order. The first list is empty since for k=1 there are no numbers between prime(k)=2 and prime(k+1)=3.
%C A276435 2) The second list of composites corresponds to k=2 and is made by numbers between prime(k)=3 and prime(k+1)=5 which consists of the number 4 only. But for this number the smallest number z that satisfies "z mod 1 = 4 mod 1" is z=0 and since this is not greater than 1, z=0 is not in the sequence.
%C A276435 3) To find the first element of the sequence we must keep on increasing k until the list of i composites {C1,C2,C3,...,Ci} between prime(k) and prime(k+1) is such that the smallest number z that satisfies the integer congruences "z mod 1 = C1 mod 1", "z mod 2 = C1 mod 2", "z mod 3 = C3 mod 3", ... "z mod i = Ci mod i", is greater than 1.
%C A276435 The first k for which the previous condition is satisfied is k=9, as explained in the Example section. So the first term of the sequence is a(1)=23.
%C A276435 4) Following this algorithm we find that a(n=2)=31 with k=11, and a(n=11) =31 with k=36. The value 31 is also assigned to a(n=23) obtained with k=58. In fact for k=58 we have the i=5 composites 272, 273,274, 275 and 276 (between prime(58)=271 and prime(59)=277), and z=31 is the smallest number greater than 1 that satisfies the corresponding five congruences.
%C A276435 The four scatter plots of the first elements obtained exploring respectively the first 10^2, 10^3, 10^4 and 10^5 primes shows similar peculiar patterns which suggests self-similarity and quite probably a fractal structure (see plots in link).

%e A276435 The first term is obtained with k = 9 for which prime(9)=23, prime(10)=29, and its corresponding i=5 intermediate composites are 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28, then a(1) = z = 23 because this is the smallest integer that satisfies all five integer congruences:
%e A276435 z mod 1 = 24 mod 1,
%e A276435 z mod 2 = 25 mod 2,
%e A276435 z mod 3 = 26 mod 3,
%e A276435 z mod 4 = 27 mod 4,
%e A276435 z mod 5 = 28 mod 5.
%e A276435 With k = 10 the corresponding primes are prime(10)=29 and prime(11)=31, and the only (i=1) corresponding intermediate composite is 30, then the smallest z that satisfies z mod 1 = 30 mod 1 is z=0 which is not greater than 1 and then, k=10 cannot be used to generate a term of the sequence.
%e A276435 The second term is obtained with k = 11 for which prime(11)=31, prime(12)=37, and the corresponding i=5 intermediate composites are 32, 33, 34, 35 and 36, then a(2) = z = 31 because this is the smallest integer that satisfies:
%e A276435 z mod 1 = 32 mod 1,
%e A276435 z mod 2 = 33 mod 2,
