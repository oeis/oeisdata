%N A276001 Numbers n for which A060502(n) <= 1; numbers with at most one distinct slope in their factorial representation.
%C A276001 Indexing starts from zero, because a(0)=0 is a special case in this sequence. To get those n for which A060502(n) = 1, start listing terms from a(1) = 1 onward.
%C A276001 From n=1 onward numbers in whose factorial base representation (A007623) the difference i_x - d_x is the same for all nonzero digits d_x present. Here i_x is the position of digit d_x from the least significant end.
%C A276001 From n=1 onward also n such that A060498(n) is a one-ball juggling pattern.
%H A276001 <a href="/index/Fa#facbase">Index entries for sequences related to factorial base representation</a>
%e A276001 4 ("20" in factorial base) is present, because all nonzero digits are on the same slope as there is only one nonzero digit.
%e A276001 14 ("210" in factorial base) is present, because all nonzero digits are on the same slope, as 3-2 = 2-1.
%e A276001 19 ("301" in factorial base) is present, because all nonzero digits are on the same slope, as 3-3 = 1-1.
%e A276001 21 ("311" in factorial base) is NOT present, because not all of its nonzero digits are on the same slope, as 3-3 <> 2-1.
