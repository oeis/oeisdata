%N A276072 Radius of the outer Soddy circle (or the longest side) of primitive Heronian triangles whose outer Soddy center lies on its longest side.
%C A276072 It has been shown that if the outer Soddy circle center of a triangle lies on one of its sides then this side is the longest and is equal in length to both the outer Soddy radius and the excircle radius associated with the vertex opposite the longest side. Furthermore, the sum of the tangents of the triangle's half angles opposite the two smaller sides equals 1.

%e A276072 The triangle ABC with sides {a, b, c} = {21, 20, 13} has an outer Soddy radius and an exradius (opp. vertex A) equal to 21. Its area is 126. The outer Soddy center lies on BC (= 21) at the tangential point with the A excircle at length 15 from B.
