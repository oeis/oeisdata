%N A276163 a(n) is the maximum first-player score difference of a "Coins in a Row" game over all permutations of coins 1..n with both players using a minimax strategy.
%C A276163 a(2*n) = n^2 via [1, n+1, 2, n+2, ..., n, 2*n]

%e A276163 For n=4, the first player would take 4, the second player would take 2, the first player would take 3, and the second player would take 1. The resulting score difference would be 4 - 2 + 3 - 1 = 4.
