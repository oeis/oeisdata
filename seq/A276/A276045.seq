%C A276045 Conjecture: this sequence is infinite.
%C A276045 It appears that the prime numbers in this sequence which have 7 for as final digit form the sequence A104164.
%C A276045 Conjecture: this sequence contains infinitely many twin primes. The first few twin primes in this sequence are 17,19,59,61,107,109,521,523,599,601,... (End)

%C A276045 This sequence equals the union of {13} and A234095; proof by double inclusion:
%C A276045 -> 1st inclusion: {13} Union A234095 is included in A276045.
%C A276045 1) if p = 13, then 13*27 = 351 = 3^3 * 13, hence d(351) = 8 and 13 belongs to A276045.
%C A276045 2) if p is in A234095, then p*(2*p+1) = p*r*s (p,r,s primes) and d(p*r*s) = 8, hence p is in 276045.
%C A276045 -> 2nd inclusion: A276045 is included in {13} Union A234095.
%C A276045 If p is in A276095, then m=p*(2*p+1) has 8 divisors and there are only three possibilities: m = u*v*w, or m = u^3*v or m = u^7 with u, v, w are distinct primes.
%C A276045 1st case: if p*(2*p+1) = u*v*w then u=p, and 2p+1=v*w is semiprime; hence, p is in A234095 Union {13}.
%C A276045 2nd case: if p*(2p+1) = u^3*v then  p=v and 2*p+1=u^3 ==> 2*p = u^3-1 = (u-1)*(u^2+u+1) with 2 and p are primes; then (u-1=2, u^2+u+1=p) so u=3, and p=3^2+3+1=13; hence p = 13 belongs to {13} Union A234095.
%C A276045 3rd case: p*(2p+1) = u^7 is impossible.
%C A276045 Conclusion: this sequence = {13} Union A234095. (End)
