%N A132681 Infinitesimal generator matrix for a diagonally-shifted Pascal matrix, binomial(n+m,k+m), for m=1, related to Laguerre(n,x,m).
%C A132681 Analogous to the infinitesimal Pascal matrix (m=0), A132440.
%C A132681 In general the matrix T begins (here m=1)
%C A132681 0;
%C A132681 m+1,0;
%C A132681 0, m+2, 0;
%C A132681 0, 0, m+3, 0;
%C A132681 0, 0, 0, m+4, 0;
%C A132681 Let LM(t) = exp(t*T) = limit [1 + t*T/n]^n as n tends to infinity.
%C A132681 Laguerre matrix(m) = [bin(n+m,k+m)] = LM(1) = exp(T) = [ revert of A074909 for m=1 ]. Truncating the series gives the n X n submatrices. In fact, the submatrices of T are nilpotent with [Tsub_n]^(n+1) = 0 for n=0,1,2,....
%C A132681 Inverse Lag matrix(m) = LM(-1) = exp(-T)
%C A132681 Umbrally LM[b(.)] = exp(b(.)*T) = [ bin(n+m,k+m) * b(n-k) ]
%C A132681 A(j) = T^j / j! equals the matrix [bin(n+m,k+m) * delta(n-k-j)] where delta(n) = 1 if n=0 and vanishes otherwise (Kronecker delta); i.e. A(j) is a matrix with all the terms 0 except for the j-th lower (or main for j=0) diagonal which equals that of the Laguerre(m) matrix. Hence the A(j)'s form a linearly independent basis for all matrices of the form [bin(n+m,k+m) d(n-k)].
%C A132681 For sequences with b(0) = 1, umbrally,
%C A132681 LM[b(.)] = exp(b(.)*T) = [ bin(n+m,k+m)] * b(n-k) ] .
%C A132681 [LM[b(.)]]^(-1) = exp(c(.)*T) = [ bin(n+m,k+m)] * c(n-k) ] where c = LPT(b) with LPT the list partition transform of A133314. Or,
%C A132681 [LM[b(.)]]^(-1) = exp[LPT(b(.))*T] = LPT[LM(b(.))] = LM[LPT(b(.))] = LM[c(.)] .
%C A132681 The matrix operation b = T*a can be characterized in several ways in terms of the coefficients a(n) and b(n), their o.g.f.'s A(x) and B(x), or e.g.f.'s EA(x) and EB(x).
%C A132681 1) b(0) = 0, b(n) = (n+m) * a(n-1),
%C A132681 2) B(x) = x^(-m) (xDx) x^m A(x)
%C A132681 3) B(x) = x * Lag(1,-:xD:,m) A(x) = x * [(m+1) + xD] A(x)
%C A132681 4) EB(x) = D^(m) * (x) * D^(-m) EA(x) where D is the derivative w.r.t. x, (:xD:)^j = x^j*D^j, Lag(n,x,m) is the associated Laguerre polynomial and D^(-m) x^n / n! = x^(m+n) / (m+n)! are Riemann-Liouville integrals.
%C A132681 So the exponentiated operator can be characterized (with loose notation) as
%C A132681 5) exp(t*T) A(x) = x^(-m) exp(t*xDx) x^m A(x) = [sum(n=0,1,...) (t*x)^n * Lag(n,-:xD:m)] A(x) = [exp{[t*u/(1-t*u)]*:xD:} / (1-t*u)^(m+1) ] A(x) (eval. at u=x) = A[x/(1-t*x)]/(1-t*x)^(m+1), a generalized Euler transformation for an o.g.f.,
%C A132681 6) exp(t*T) EA(x) = D^(m) exp(t*x) D^(-m) EA(x) = [D/(D-1)]^m exp[(t+a(.))*x] = exp(t*x) [(t+D)/D]^m EA(x)
%C A132681 7) exp(t*T) * a = LM(t) * a = [sum(k=0,...,n) bin(n+m,k+m)* t^(n-k) * a(k)], a vector array.
%C A132681 With t=1 and a(k) = (-x)^k / k!, then LM(1) * a = [Laguerre(n,x,m)], a vector array with index n and the o.g.f. A(x) becomes transformed into the e.g.f. for the associated Laguerre polynomials of order m.
%C A132681 The exponential formulas can be umbrally extended as in A132440. And, the formulas can be extended to non-integer m.
