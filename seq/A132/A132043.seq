%N A132043 Number of bitransversal (transversal and dual transversal) matroids on n unlabeled elements.
%C A132043 A transversal matroid is a matroid whose independent sets are the partial transversals of a family of subsets of [1..n], while a bitransversal matroid is a transversal matroid whose dual is transversal. The principal (or fundamental) transversal matroids enumerated by A049312 form an important subset of bitransversal matroids.
