%N A132283 Normalization of dense fractal sequence A054065 (defined from fractional parts {n*phi}, where phi = golden ratio).
%C A132283 A fractal sequence, dense in the sense that if i,j are neighbors in a segment, then eventually i and j are separated by some k in all later segments. (Hence in the "limit", i,j are separated by infinitely many other numbers.)

%e A132283 Start with A054065=(1,2,1,2,1,3,2,4,1,3,5,2,4,1,3,5,2,4,1,6,3,5,2,...)
%e A132283 Step 1. Append initial 1.
%e A132283 Step 2. Write segments: 1; 1,2; 1,2; 1,3,2,4; 1,3,5,2,4;...
%e A132283 Step 3. Delete repeated segments: 1; 1,2; 1,3,2,4; 1,3,5,2,4; ...
%e A132283 Step 4. Make segment #n have length n by allowing only newcomer, namely n, like this: 1; 1,2; 1,3,2; 1,3,2,4; 1,3,5,2,4; 1,6,3,5,2,4; ...
%e A132283 Step 5. Concatenate those segments.
