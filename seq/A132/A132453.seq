%N A132453 First primitive GF(2)[X] polynomial of degree n and minimal number of terms.
%C A132453 More precisely: minimum value for X=2 of primitive GF(2)[X] polynomials of degree n and minimal number of terms for such polynomials. Applications include maximum-length linear feedback shift registers with efficient implementation in both hardware and software.

%e A132453 a(10)=1033, or 10000001001 in binary, representing the GF(2)[X] polynomial X^10+X^3+1, because this polynomial has degree 10, it has 3 terms and no degree 10 polynomial with less terms than that is primitive and it is primitive, contrary to X^10+X^1+1, X^10+X^2+1 and X^10+X^2+X^1.
%Y A132453 Subset of A091250. A132454(n) encodes a(n) in a more compact representation. Cf. A132447, similar, with no restriction on number of terms. Cf. A132449, similar, with restriction to at most 5 terms. Cf. A132451, similar, with restriction to exactly 5 terms.
