%N A158379 Period-lengths of the base-3 MR-expansions of the reciprocals of the positive integers.
%C A158379 See A136042 for the definition of the MR-expansion.
%C A158379 It appears that if p is a prime with 3 as a primitive root (A001122), then the MR-expansion of 1/p is periodic with period p-1.
%C A158379 The period lengths of the base-2 MR-expansions of the reciprocals of the positive integers are given in A136043.
%e A158379 The base-3 MR-expansion of 1/5 is {2,1,0,1,2,1,0,1,...} because 1/5->3/5->9/5->4/5->12/5->7/5->2/5->6/5->1/5->..., indicating that MR(1/5,3) begins {2,1,0,1,...} and has period 4. Thus a(5)=4.
