%N A158704 Nonnegative integers with an even number of even powers of 2 in their base-2 representation.
%C A158704 The nonnegative integers with an odd number of even powers of 2 in their base-2 representation are given in A158705.
%C A158704 It appears that a result similar to Prouhet's theorem holds for the terms of A158704 and A158705, specifically: Sum_{k=0..2^n-2, k has an even number of even powers of 2} k^j = Sum_{k=0..2^n-2, k has an odd number of even powers of 2} k^j, for 0 <= j <= (n-1)/2. For a recent treatment of this theorem, see the reference.
%C A158704 Conjecture: take any binary vector of length 4n+3 with n >= 0. We can activate any bits. When a bit is activated, neighboring bits change their values 0 -> 1, 1 -> 0. Our goal is to turn the original binary vector into a vector of only ones by activating the bits. If the value of the binary vector belongs to this sequence, this is possible for a maximum of 4n+3 activations. - _Mikhail Kurkov_, Jun 01 2021

%e A158704 The base-2 representation of 5 is 101, i.e., 5 = 2^2 + 2^0, with two even powers of 2. Thus 5 is a term of the sequence.
