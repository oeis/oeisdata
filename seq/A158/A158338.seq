%e A158338 6 is composite and has 4 divisors (1, 2, 3, 6); 6 - 4 = 2, which is prime, so 6 is in the sequence.
%e A158338 15 is composite and has 4 divisors (1, 3, 5, 15); 15 - 4 = 11, which is prime, so 15 is in the sequence.
%e A158338 16 is composite and has 5 divisors (1, 2, 4, 8, 16); 16 - 5 = 11, which is prime, so 16 is in the sequence.
