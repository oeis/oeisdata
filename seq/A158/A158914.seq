%N A158914 Primes p such that there is a composite c with sigma_2(p)=sigma_2(c).
%C A158914 No other terms less than 10^8.
%C A158914 The corresponding composite numbers are 6, 40, 136, and 3352.
%C A158914 Is this sequence finite?
%C A158914 See A158913 for the sequence for sigma_1.
%C A158914 Terms 47, 157, 3863 are x values of solutions to Pell-Fermat equation x^2 - 85*y^2 = 84, where y is also prime and c = 8*y. For any other solution (x,y) formed by primes, x is a term. - _Max Alekseyev_, Jun 14 2025
