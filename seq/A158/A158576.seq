%N A158576 a(n) = number of components of the graph P(n,10) (defined in Comments).
%C A158576 Let H(n,b) be the Hamming graph whose vertices are the sequences of length n over the alphabet {0,1,...,b-1} with adjacency being defined by having Hamming distance 1. Let P(n,b) be the subgraph of H(n,b) induced by the set of vertices which are base b representations of primes with n digits (not allowing leading 0 digits).
%C A158576 For 6 and 7 digit primes there is a single large component and the remaining components have size 1. For 8 digit primes there is a single large component, the size 2 component {89391959, 89591959} and the remaining components have size 1. [_W. Edwin Clark_, Mar 31 2009]
%C A158576 The elements of size 2 components in these graphs are sequence A253269. [_Michael Kleber_, May 04 2015]
%e A158576 The 6-digit primes 294001, 505447, 584141, 604171, 929573, 971767 (cf. A050249) have the property that changing any single digit always gives a composite number, so these are isolated nodes in the graph P(6,10) (which also has one large connected component).
%Y A158576 Cf. A145667-A145674, A158577, A158578, A158579, A050249, A253269.
