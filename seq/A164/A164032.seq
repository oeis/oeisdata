%N A164032 Number of "ON" cells in a certain 2-dimensional cellular automaton.
%C A164032 This automaton starts with one ON cell and evolves according to the rule that a cell is ON in a given generation if and only if the number of ON cells, among the cell itself and its eight nearest neighbors, was exactly one in the preceding generation.

%F A164032 It appears that this is the self-generating sequence defined by the following process: start with s={1,9} and repeatedly extend by concatenating s with 4*s, thus obtaining {1,9} -> {1,9,4,36} -> {1,9,4,36,4,36,16,144},... , etc.
%F A164032 Also, it appears that if n=2^k+j, with n>2 and 1<=j<=2^k, then a(n)=4a(j), with a(1)=1, a(2)=9.
%F A164032 From _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jul 21 2014: (Start)
%F A164032 Both of these assertions are not difficult to prove. At generation G = 2^k (k>=1) the ON cells are bounded by a box of edge 2G-1, and in that box there are (G/2)^2 3X3 blocks each containing 9 ON cells (separated by rows of OFF cells of width 1), so a total of a(2^k) = 9*2^(2k-2) ON cells (cf. A002063).
%F A164032 This box is full (more precisely, every cell in it has more than one ON neighbor), and at generation G+1 we have just 4 ON cells which are now at the corners of a box of edge 2G+1. Until the next power of 2 there is no interaction between the configurations that grow at the four corners, and so a(2^k+j) = 4a(j), as conjectured.
%F A164032 In fact this implies an explicit formula for a(n):
%F A164032 a(n) = c*4^wt(floor((n-1)/2)),
%F A164032 where c=1 if n is odd, c=9 if n is even, and wt(i) = A000120(i) is the binary weight function. For example, if n=20, [(n-1)/2]=9 which has weight 2, so a(20) = 9*4^2 = 144. (End)
