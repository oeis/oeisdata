%N A164047 The number of symmetric numerical sets with odd Frobenius number and no small atoms.
%C A164047 Definition using terminology of [MM]: Asigma(k)' is the number of symmetric numerical sets S with Frobenius number 2k-1. This is denoted A^\sigma_{2k-1}^\prime in [MM]. Asigma(k)' equals the number of sigma-admissible subsets L of {1,2,...,2k-2} such that if x is an element of M then 2k-1-x is not an element of M. It also equals the number of vertices at height k in the rooted tree shown in figure 5 of [MM]. For large k, Asigma(k)' is approximately equal to .23065 x 2^(k-1) [MM]. The number of symmetric numerical sets with Frobenius number 2k and no small atoms equals Asigma(k)' by theorem 19 of [MM].

%o A164047 ! This program calculates the cardinality of the number of symmetric numerical monoids without a small atom (or symmetric "good sets") for Frobenius number, $g$, as represented by $A_g^\sigma'$ defined in "Counting numerical sets with no small atoms" ([MM]) by Jeremy L. Marzuola and Andy Miller (to appear in Journal of Combinatorial Theory: A).
%o A164047 ! Here we set the parameters of computation. We represent a numerical set by binary representations of the elements below the Frobenius number. Namely, a $0$ means an element is not in a set and a $1$ means an element is in the set. The symmetric numerical sets will be stored in an array called $Gin$, which will be redefined for each $g$ for the purposes of iterating the algorithm. Each row of Gin corresponds to a numerical set, e.g. the row $Gin(3,-)=(1,1,0,1,0,0)$ would determine the numerical set ${1,2,4} \cup N_5$. This is a slight variation of the notation presented in Figure 5 of [MM], where only the initial half segment is presented since the remainder is clear by symmetry.
%o A164047 !The dimension here is limited only by the memory of the author's computers. With greater computational ability, you would be able to larger values of $g$.
%o A164047 !Generically we need only take the dimension of $z$ to be $Mit+3$.
%o A164047       INTEGER*1, DIMENSION(21290000,50) :: G1, Gin
%o A164047       INTEGER, DIMENSION(40) :: z
%o A164047       INTEGER j, Mit, N1, N2, k, n, flag1
%o A164047 !Initialize z to be zero in every component.
%o A164047       do j = 1,40 z(j) = 0 enddo
%o A164047 ! $Mit$ is the number of times we iterate our algorithm. Since we begin with $g=3$, the resulting output will print out $A_g^\sigma'$ as $g$ ranges from $1$ to $Mit+3$. At each stage of the iteration, we have $g=j+3$.
%o A164047       Mit = 24
%o A164047 ! We begin with the symmetric good sets for $g=3$ given by only $(1,0)$. We need these sets in order to run the algorithm suggested in the paper from the rooted tree in Figure 5 of [MM]. After each iteration of the code, $Gin$ will be redefined as the collection of symmetric good sets for $g = n+2$. If one wants to see the symmetric "good" sets for a specific $g$, one must print $Gin$ after the iteration leading to that $g$.
%o A164047       Gin(1,1) = 1
%o A164047       Gin(1,2) = 0
%o A164047 ! We determine the number, $z(g)$, of symmetric good sets for $g = 1,2,3$ for the implementation of the algorithm. In the notation of [MM], $z(g) = A_g^\sigma'$.
%o A164047       z(1) = 1
%o A164047       z(2) = 1
%o A164047       z(3) = 1
%o A164047 ! $N1$ will represent the number of symmetric good sets $A_g^\sigma'$ for Frobenius number $g$ and $N2$ is the size of the numerical sets themselves for the given $g$. Here we begin with $g = 3$, so $N1 = A_3^\sigma' = 1$. For $g=n$, we have $N2 = |{1,...,n-1}|=n-1$.
%o A164047       N1 = 1
%o A164047       N2 = 2
%o A164047 ! Here we implement the algorithm by building the good sets for $g=2n+1$ based on those that exist for $g=2n-1$.
%o A164047       do j = 1,Mit
%o A164047         flag1 = 0
%o A164047 ! If $g=2n$, we know from Theorem 19 of the paper that $z(2n)=z(2n-1)$.
%o A164047         if (mod(j,2) == 1) then
%o A164047           z(j+3) = z(j+2)
%o A164047         endif
%o A164047 ! If $g=2n+1$, we implement the algorithm discussed in [MM]. Mainly, we need to count $A_g^\sigma'$. See Figure 5 for a pictoral reference to this algorithm.
%o A164047         if (mod(j,2) == 0) then
%o A164047           do k = 1,N1
%o A164047 ! Let $G$ be a symmetric good set for $g=2n-1$. If $G$ is bivalent, we can build good sets of size of size $2n+1$ by adding $01$, $10$ to the middle of the set as described in Figure 5 of [MM].
