%N A164709 A positive integer n is included if all runs of 1's in binary n are of the same length, and if there are at least two runs of 1's.
%C A164709 Clarification: A binary number consists of "runs" completely of 1's alternating with runs completely of 0's. No two or more runs all of the same digit are adjacent.
%C A164709 For the terms of this sequence together with those positive integers that, when written in binary, each contain only one run of 1's, see A164707.
