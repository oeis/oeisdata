%N A164705 T(n,k)=Binomial(2n-k,n)*2^(k-1) for n>=1,0<=k<=n
%C A164705 T(n,k) is the number of 2n digit binary sequences in which the (n+1)th zero occurs in the (2n-k+1)th position. T(n,k)/2^(2n-1) is the probability sought in Banach's matchbox problem. Row sum is 2^(2n-1) T(n,0)=T(n,1)=A001700(n)
%e A164705 T(2,1)=3 because there are 3 length 4 binary sequences in which the third zero appears in the fourth position: {0,0,1,0},{0,1,0,0},{1,0,0,0}.
