%N A164293 Decimal expansion of the twin prime constant associated with the binary constant in A164292.
%C A164293 Twin prime constant decimals (A164292)_2 = 0.1646823906345389353962381...
%C A164293 Similar: prime constant decimals A051006 = 0.4146825098511116602481096...
%C A164293 If twin prime conjecture is false then this twin prime constant is rational! As a counterpart if it is not rational, the conjecture is true.
%C A164293 If the conjecture is proved by other means, it will remain to see if it is irrational or transcendental.
