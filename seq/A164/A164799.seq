%N A164799 a(n) = the smallest positive integer such that the product of a(n) consecutive integers, where n is the smallest, is divisible by every prime from 2 to the largest prime divisor of the product. (a(1)=1.)
%C A164799 a(1) could = 2, because 1 is not divisible by any prime, but 1*2 = 2 is. This is the only case where a(n) > n. a(n) != [6..9] for all n. a(11)=5 is the last time a(n)=5, a(63)=4 is the last time a(n)=4, a(350)=3 is the last time a(n)=3, and a(633555)=2 is the last time a(n)=2. For n>633555, and a(n)!=1, a(n) is greater than the length of the largest prime gap starting before n, so no sequence of consecutive integers starting above 633555 can be prime free and produce a product that has a complete set of prime divisors up to its greatest prime divisor. - _Ken Clements_, Dec 08 2025
%F A164799 a(n) = A164798(n) - n + 1.
%e A164799 Consider the products of consecutive integers, (m+9)!/9!, m >= 1. First, 10 is divisible by 2 and 5, but there is a prime gap since 3 is missing from the factorization. 10*11 is divisible by 2, 5, and 11, but 3 and 7 are missing. 10*11*12 is divisible by 2, 3, 5, and 11, but 7 is missing. 10*11*12*13 is divisible by all primes up to 13, except 7. But 10*11*12*13*14 is indeed divisible by every prime from 2 to 13. So a(10) = 5 because 5 consecutive numbers are multiplied together.
