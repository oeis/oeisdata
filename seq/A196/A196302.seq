%N A196302 Smallest highly composite number that is not a divisor of n-th highly composite number or 0 if no such number exists.
%C A196302 a(19) is the last 0 in this sequence.
%e A196302 a(4) = 4 because 6, the fourth highly composite number, is a multiple of 1 and 2 but not of 4.
%e A196302 a(5) = 0 because 12 is a multiple of all of 1, 2, 4, 6, and 12.
