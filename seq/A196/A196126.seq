%N A196126 Let A = {(x,y): x, y positive  natural numbers and y <= x <= y^2}. a(n) is the cardinality of the subset {(x,y) in A such that x <= n}.
%C A196126 The set A locates integer points in the first quadrant above the parabola y=sqrt(x) up to the diagonal y=x. a(n) counts them up to a sliding right margin.
%C A196126 The first differences of the sequence are 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 31, ....
%C A196126 In that way the sequence is constructed from first differences which are the natural numbers and repetitions for 3, 7, 13, 21, 31, 43, 57, 73, 91,...., (apparently the elements of A002061 starting at 3).
%F A196126 a(n) = u*(u+1)*(2*u+1)/6 - u*(u-1)/2 + (n-u)*(n-u+1)/2, where u = floor(sqrt(n)) = A000196(n).
%e A196126 The set is A = {(1,1),(2,2),(3,2),(4,2),(3,3),(4,3),(5,3),(6,3),(7,3),(8,3),(9,3),(4,4),(5,4),...}.
%e A196126 a(1) = 1 that is the number of elements in {(1,1)},
%e A196126 a(2) = 2 that is the number of elements in {(1,1),(2,2)} and
%e A196126 a(3) = 4 that is the number of elements in {(1,1),(2,2),(3,2),(3,3)},  ...
