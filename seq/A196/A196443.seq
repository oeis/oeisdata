%N A196443 a(n) = the sum of GCQ_A(n, k) for 1 <= k <= n (see definition in comments).
%C A196443 Definition of GCQ_A: The greatest common non-divisor of type A (GCQ_A) of two positive integers a and b (a<=b) is the largest positive non-divisor q of numbers a and b such that 1<=q<=a common to a and b; GCQ_A(a, b) = 0 if  no such c exists.
%C A196443 GCQ_A(1, b) = GCQ_A(2, b) = 0 for b >=1. GCQ_A(a, b) = 0 or >= 2.
%e A196443 For n = 6, a(6) = 9 because GCQ_A(6, 1) = 0, GCQ_A(6, 2) = 0, GCQ_A(6, 3) = 0, GCQ_A(6, 4) = 0, GCQ_A(6, 5) = 4, GCQ_A(6, 6) = 5. Sum of results is 9.
