%N A196938 a(n) is the prime number that is the center element (3rd) of a 5-terms arithmetic progression prime chain.
%C A196938 The Mathematica program gives the first 53 terms.
%C A196938 The Mathematica program is also good for finding sequences with any odd number of terms.

%e A196938 {5,13,[17],23,29} is a 5-term arithmetic progression prime chain, so a(1)=17; (for all primes smaller than 17, no such chains exist)
%e A196938 {5,17,[29].41,53} is a 5-term arithmetic progression prime chain, so a(2)=29; (for all primes in between 17 and 29, no such chains exist)
