%N A196558 a(n) is the index of the first occurrence of n in A195061.
%C A196558 In sequence A195061, the 2nd through 25th terms are 1's, which means it is possible to find a sum of p=b+c, p=prime(n), the prime factors of b and c traverse all primes smaller than sqrt(prime(n)). From the 36th term, the above case no longer holds for most primes. However, if you choose two eligible sums p=b1+c1=b2+c2, it becomes possible that the union set of prime factors of b1, c1, b2, and c2 traverses all primes smaller than sqrt(prime(n)). This stands until prime(107)=587. For prime(108)=593, no group of two b's and c's can have the union set of their prime factors to traverse all primes smaller than sqrt(prime(n)).  Three groups of b's and c's will be needed to do so. And starting from prime(284)=1861, four groups are needed for some of the numbers.
%C A196558 The listed Mathematica program fails to find a(5) since it exceeds the integer range as index.
%e A196558 A195061(2)=1 => a(1)=2;
%e A196558 A195061(3)=A195061(4)=...=A195061(35)=1; A195061(36) = 2 => a(2)=36;
%e A196558 A195061(1..107) <= 2; A195061(108)=3 => a(3)=108;
%e A196558 A195061(1..283) <= 3; A195061(284)=4 => a(4)=284.
