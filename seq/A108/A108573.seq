%N A108573 Least positive k such that k * [RSA-640]^n - 1 is prime, where RSA-640 is the 193 decimal digit RSA challenge number.
%C A108573 Other terms are a(25)=1558 and a(43)=5718. All values in the sequence are Fermat and Lucas PRPs except for the first two which were proved with ECM. The larger values won't be easily provable until RSA-640 is factored, which has a prize of $20,000 for its factorization. This sequence is based on a suggestion of _Jens Kruse Andersen_.
%C A108573 RSA-640 was factored in 2005; see the Wikipedia link. - _D. S. McNeil_, Nov 26 2010
