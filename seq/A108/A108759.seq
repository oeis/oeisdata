%N A108759 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) = binomial(3k,k)*binomial(n+k,3k)/(2k+1) (0 <= k <= floor(n/2)).
%C A108759 Row n has 1+floor(n/2) terms. Row sums are the Catalan numbers (A000108). T(2n,n) = binomial(3n,n)/(2n+1) (A001764).
%C A108759 Triangle read by rows: number of ordered trees counted by number of interior vertices adjacent to a leaf. T(n,k) = number of ordered trees on n edges (A000108) containing k nodes adjacent to a leaf, where a node is a non-leaf non-root vertex. - _David Callan_, Jul 25 2005
%C A108759 T(n,k) counts full binary trees on 2n edges by the value k of the following statistic X. Delete all right edges leaving the left edges in place. This partitions the left edges into line segments of lengths say ell(1),ell(2),...,ell(t), with Sum_{i=1..t} ell(i) = n. Then X = Sum_{i=1..t} floor(ell(i)/2). This result is implicit in the Sun reference. Also, there is a standard bijection from full binary trees on 2n edges to Dyck paths of length 2n: draw tree up from root; walk clockwise around the tree starting at the root; process in turn each edge *that has not previously been traversed*: a left edge becomes an upstep and a right edge becomes a downstep. Translated to Dyck paths using this walkaround bijection, the statistic X becomes the sum, taken over all the ascents A, of floor(length(A)/2). (An ascent is a maximal sequence of contiguous upsteps. Its length is the number of upsteps in it). - _David Callan_, Jul 22 2008
