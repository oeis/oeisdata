%N A108389 Transmutable primes with four distinct digits.
%C A108389 This sequence is a subsequence of A108386 and of A108388. See the latter for the definition of transmutable primes and many more comments. Are any terms here doubly-transmutable also; i.e., terms of A108387? Palindromic too? Terms also of some other sequences cross-referenced below? a(7)=771319973999 is also a reversible prime (emirp). a(12)=9311933973733 also has the property that simultaneously removing all its 1's (93933973733), all its 3s (9119977) and all its 9s (3113373733) result in primes (but removing all 7s gives 93119339333=43*47*59*83*97^2, so a(12) is not also a term of A057876). Any additional terms have 14 or more digits.
