%N A108661 Square loops: the number of circular permutations (reversals not counted as different) of the numbers 0 to n such that the sum of any two consecutive numbers is a square.
%e A108661 There is no solution for n=0,...,30, (note offset=31). For n=0,1 we have the trivial square circles {0} and {0,1}, which are not included in the sequence.
%e A108661 There are only six possible square loops of the minimum length (n=31 case):
%e A108661   {1,0,4,5,31,18,7,29,20,16,9,27,22,3,13,12,24,25,11,14,2,23,26,10,6,30,19,17,8,28,21,15},
%e A108661   {1,0,4,12,13,3,6,30,19,17,8,28,21,15,10,26,23,2,14,22,27,9,16,20,29,7,18,31,5,11,25,24},
%e A108661   {1,0,4,21,28,8,17,19,30,6,3,13,12,24,25,11,5,31,18,7,29,20,16,9,27,22,14,2,23,26,10,15},

%e A108661 In the n=32,33 (resp.) cases, there are three square loop solutions:
