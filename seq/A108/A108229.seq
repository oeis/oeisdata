%N A108229 n occurs Lucas number L(n) times (A000204).
%C A108229 This is the Lucas number equivalent of "n occurs A000045(n) times" (A072649), which is one of an infinite number of sequences derived from the Self-Counting Sequence [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, ... (A002024)] which consists of 1 copy of 1, 2 copies of 2, 3 copies of 3 and so on. These include Golomb's sequence, also known as Silverman's sequence (A001462) and the like. As with these others, the challenge is to give a surprisingly simple closed-form formula for a(n).
%e A108229 Because the first few Lucas numbers L(n), for n = 1, 2, 3, ... are 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123, the current sequence consists of 1 one, 3 twos, 4 threes, 7 fours, 11 fives, 29 sixes, 47 sevens, 76 eights, 123 nines and so on.
