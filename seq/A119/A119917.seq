%N A119917 Number of rationals in [0, 1) consisting just of repeating bits of period at most n.
%F A119917 a(n) = sum_{i=1..n} sum_{d|i} (2^d - 1) * mu(i/d)
%e A119917 1/6 = 0.0010101... has repeating bits of period 2, but is not counted because it has a preperiodic part (i.e., the repetition doesn't start immediately after the binary point). Also, 0 = 0.000... is counted and considered to have period 1.
%e A119917 a(1) = |{0 = 0.(0)...}| = 1
