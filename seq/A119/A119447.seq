%N A119447 Leading diagonal of triangle A119446, as described in A100461, except with a(1,n) = prime(n) instead of 2^(n-1).
%C A119447 a(181) = 27 is the first term greater than 19. This is because prime(181)/181 > 6 for the first time. In general this sequence is determined by prime(n)/n: the pattern for each row of the triangle is that it ends with prime(n), preceded by multiples of k = prime(n)/n down to k^2, then the largest multiple of k-1 less than k^2 and the largest multiple of k-2 less than that and so on. This sequence gives the multiple of 1. See A000960 for the sequence that gives the ending value for each starting k.
%F A119447 With k = prime(n)/n, a(n) = A000960(k).
%Y A119447 Cf. A100461 for powers of 2, A119444 for Fibonacci and A119446 for triangle corresponding to this diagonal.
