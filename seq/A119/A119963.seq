%N A119963 Triangle T(n,k), 0 <= k <= n, read by rows, with T(2n,2k) = T(2n+1,2k) = T(2n+1,2k+1) = T(2n+2,2k+1) = binomial(n,k).
%C A119963 From _John P. McSorley_, Aug 24 2010: (Start)
%C A119963 A combinatorial interpretation of this triangle is as follows:
%C A119963 Ignore the first column of 1's of the above triangle and the call the (n,k) entry of the new triangle formed RE(n,k).
%C A119963 Hence row 8 of the 'RE(n,k)' triangle is 1 4 3 6 3 4 1 1.
%C A119963 Now see sequence A180171 for the definition of a k-reverse of n.
%C A119963 Briefly, a k-reverse of n is a k-composition of n which is cyclically equivalent to its reverse.
%C A119963 Sequence A180171 is the 'R(n,k)' triangle read by rows where R(n,k) is the total number of k-reverses of n.
%C A119963 Then RE(n,k) is the number of k-reverses of n up to cyclic equivalence.
%C A119963 In sequence A180171 we have R(8,3)=9 because there are 9 3-reverses of 8.
%C A119963 In cyclically equivalent classes: {116,611,161} {224,422,242}, and {233,323,332}; since there are 3 such classes we have RE(8,3)=3.
%C A119963 Similarly, in A180171, we have R(8,6)=21 because all 21 6-compositions of 8 are 6-reverses of 8, but they come in 4 cyclically equivalent classes (with representatives 111113, 111122, 111212, and 112112) hence RE(8,6)=4.
%C A119963 There is another (equivalent) interpretation for RE(n,k) involving k-subsets of Z_n, the integers modulo n, and the multiplier -1. See the McSorley/Schoen paper below for more details.
%C A119963 In this case it is convenient to count k-subsets up to dihedral equivalence, rather than cyclic equivalence.
%C A119963 The counts are the same. The row sums of the 'RE(n,k)' triangle give sequence A052955.

%C A119963 From _Petros Hadjicostas_, Oct 12 2017: (Start)
%C A119963 When 1 <= k <= n, each cyclically equivalence class of k-reverses of n is a "Sommerville symmetrical cyclic composition," which was introduced by Sommerville (1909). On pp. 301-304 of his paper, he proves that the number of such (equivalence classes of) compositions of n with length k is exactly T(n,k) = RE(n,k).
%C A119963 The equivalence class of a Sommerville symmetrical cyclic composition contains at least one palindromic composition (type I) or a composition that becomes a palindromic composition if we remove the first part (type II). A composition with only one part is a palindromic composition of both types. Hadjicostas and Zhang (2017) have proved that each equivalence class of k-reverses of n contains exactly two compositions that are either of type I or type II (except in the case when k | n and all the parts are the same).
%C A119963 For example, consider the case with n=8 and k=3, where RE(8,3)=3. As pointed above by J. P. McSorley, in cyclically equivalent classes we have {116,611,161} {224,422,242}, and {233,323,332}. The first class contains one composition of type I (161) and one of type II (611); the second class contains one composition of type I (242) and one of type II (422); and the last class contains one composition of type I (323) and one of type II (233).
%C A119963 When n = 6 and k = 4, the class of 4-reverses {1221, 2211, 2112, 1122} contains two compositions of type I (1221 and 2112).
%C A119963 If A is a set of positive integers and 1 <= k <= n, let RE_A(n,k) be the total number of Sommerville symmetrical cyclic compositions of n with length k and parts only in A (= number of cyclically equivalence classes of k-reverses of n with parts only in A). Then the g.f. of RE_A(n,k) is Sum_{n,k >= 1} RE_A(n,k) * x^n * y^k = (-1/2) + (1 + y * f_A(x))^2/(2 * (1 - y^2 * f_A(x^2)), where f_A(x) = Sum_{m in A} x^m. (For this sequence, A = all positive integers.)
%C A119963 Sequence A292200 contains the total number of Sommerville symmetrical cyclic compositions of n that are Carlitz (compositions that have length one, or have length >= 1 and adjacent parts of the composition on a circle are distinct).
