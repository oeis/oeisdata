%C A119458 From _Petros Hadjicostas_, Jan 05 2019: (Start)
%C A119458 Note that T(n,k) is the number of marked circular binary words of length n having k occurrences of 00 (0 <= k <= n). Let W(n,k) be the number of binary necklaces (= unmarked circular binary words) of length n with exactly k occurrences of the pattern 00 provided wrapping around the circle is allowed when n=1. More precisely, when n=1, we allow the string to wrap around itself on the circle to form a circular string of length 2. We have W(n, k) = A320341(n, k) for 0 <= k <= n.
%C A119458 Fortunately, since T(n=1, k=0) = 1 = T(n=1, k=1), the author of the sequence (indirectly) assumes that the string 0 has one occurrence of the pattern 00 (if allowed to wrap around itself on the circle only once), while the string 1 has zero occurrences of the pattern 00.
%C A119458 It makes sense to define T(n,k) = 0 when k > n. Note that G(z,t) = Sum_{n,k >=0} T(n,k)*z^n*t^k = 1 - z*(d(1-A(z,t))/dz)/(1-A(z,t)), where A(z,t) = z*(t+1) + z^2*(1-t) is the "Flajolet-Soria polynomial (g.f.)" in z of some (difficult to find) linear combinatorial structure that is defined very abstractly at the beginning of their paper and in the book by Flajolet and Sedgewick (2009). (Since the series here converge for z and t close to 0, we have that 1-t is positive for all t in a "small" interval around 0.)
%C A119458 Using the theory in Flajolet and Soria (1991) and the one in Hadjicostas and Zhang (2018), we can prove that the g.f. of the numbers W(n,k) is F(z,t) = Sum_{n >= 1, k >= 0} W(n,k)*z^n*t^k = -Sum_{d>=1} (phi(d)/d)*log(1-A(z^d,t^d)). We can also prove that W(n,k) = (1/n)*Sum_{d|gcd(n,k)} phi(d)*T(n/d, k/d) for n>=1 and 0 <= k <= n. (We omit the details.)
%C A119458 For  k=0, we get that T(n, k=0) = A000204(n) and W(n, k=0) = A000358(n) for n >= 1, and the Flajolet-Soria polynomial is A(z,t=0) = z + z^2 (which was discovered by Joerg Arndt).
%C A119458 To get univariate g.f.'s of the sequences (T(n,k): n >= 1) and (W(n, k): n >= 1) when k >= 1, we have to differentiate the previous two g.f.'s k times with respect to t, set t=0, and divide by k!. (Obviously, the log now disappears.)
%C A119458 For k=1, we get T(n, k=1) = A006490(n) and W(n, k=1) = A212804(n-1) = A006490(n)/n for n >= 1.
%C A119458 For k=2, we get T(n, k=2) = A006491(n-1) for n >= 1 (with A006491(0) := 0) and W(n, k=2) = (1/n)*(T(n,2) + I(2|n)*T(n/2,1)) for n >= 1, where I(2|n) = 1 if 2|n, and 0 otherwise.
%C A119458 For k=3, we get T(n, k=3) = A006492(n-2) for n >=1 (with A006492(m) = 0 for m = 1,2) and W(n, k=3) = (1/n)*(T(n,3) + 2*I(3|n)*T(n/3, 1)) for n >= 1.
%C A119458 This theory can be generalized for any pattern P of 0's and 1's provided one discovers the correct "Flajolet-Soria" polynomial A_P(z,t). In other words, if P is a finite pattern of zeros and ones of length L, and we let T_P(n,k) be the number of (marked) circular binary words of length n having k occurrences of P (0 <= k <= n) and we allow strings of length n, with 1 <= n < L, to wrap around themselves on the circle to form a string of length n*ceiling(L/n), then (most probably) we can express the g.f. of T_p(n,k), say G_p(z,t), in the form 1-z*(d(1-A_P(z,t))/dz)/(1-A_P(z,t)). In such a case, if W_P(n,k) is the number of binary necklaces (= unmarked circular binary words) of length n with exactly k occurrences of the pattern P, we have that its generating function is Sum_{n >= 1, k >= 0} W_P(n,k)*z^n*t^k = -Sum_{d>=1} (phi(d)/d)*log(1-A_P(z^d,t^d)). We can also prove that W_P(n,k) = (1/n)*Sum_{d|gcd(n,k)} phi(d)*T_P(n/d, k/d) for n>=1 and 0 <= k <= n.
%C A119458 One final note: it seems that the theory of Flajolet and Soria (1991) applies only to the case k=0 and to the case we consider all k simultaneously. (For fixed k >= 2, W_P(n,k) depends not only on T_P(n,k), but also on all T(n/d, k/d) where d ranges over the common divisors of n and k. Thus, for fixed k >= 2, it seems there is no linear combinatorial structure whose list of cycles of elements corresponds to the collection of necklaces we want.) See also Flajolet and Sedgewick (2009), pp. 84-85 and 729-730.
