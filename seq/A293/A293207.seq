%N A293207 Lexicographically earliest sequence of positive terms such that the function f defined by f(n) = Sum_{k=1..n} (i^k * a(k)) for any n >= 0 is injective (where i denotes the imaginary unit), and a(n) != a(n+1) and a(n) != a(n+2) for any n > 0.
%C A293207 See A293208 for the real part of f(n).
%C A293207 See A293209 for the imaginary part of f(n).
%C A293207 For any m > 0, let b_m be the lexicographically earliest sequence of positive terms such that the function f_m defined by f_m(n) = Sum_{k=1..n} (i^k * b_m(k)) for any n >= 0 is injective, and #{b_m(n), ..., b_m(n+m)} = m+1 for any n > 0:
%C A293207 - in particular, b_2 = a (this sequence) and f_2 = f,
%C A293207 - the representation of f shows an apparently chaotic initial phase followed by the emergence of a regular oscillating escape (see representations in Links section),
%C A293207 - the cases m=8 and m=12 have similarities with Langton's ant: the representation of f_m shows an apparently chaotic initial phase followed by the emergence of a regular escape (see representations in Links section),
%C A293207 - for the cases m=3, m=7, m=11 and m=15: b_m is m+1 periodic and b_m(n) = n for any n <= m+1,
%C A293207 - for the cases m=4, m=5, m=6, m=9, m=10, m=13, m=14 and m=16: the representation of f_m shows an apparently chaotic initial phase; it is unknown whether a regular escape emerges (see representation in Links section).
%C A293207 More informally, the sequence can be obtained with the following procedure:
%C A293207 - start at the origin, looking to the north,
%C A293207 - repeatedly: jump forward to the nearest non-visited square (provided that the jump length is distinct from the two previous jump lengths) and turn 90° to the left,
%C A293207 - a(n) = length of n-th jump and f(n-1) = position before n-th jump as a Gaussian integer.
