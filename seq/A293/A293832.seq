%N A293832 Smallest of a run of n consecutive integers in A061910, i.e., for which the sum of digits of their square is again a square.
%C A293832 a(9) > 10^11. It can be expected that a(n) exists for all n, at an order of magnitude a(n) ~ 10^m with m/log_10(m) ~ n.
%C A293832 A061910 considers only positive integers, and here we also consider this case. If 0 were allowed, then the first 4 terms would be 0.
%H A293832 User 'mathlove', <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1093266/">Numbers n such that the digit sum of n^2 is a square</a>, Mathematics StackExchange, Jan. 6, 2015.
%e A293832 For k = 1, 2 and 3, k^2 is a single-digit number and thus equal to its sum of digits, which therefore is a square. Therefore a(n) = 1 starts the first run of n consecutive integers with this property, for n = 1, 2 and 3.
%e A293832 However, the square of k = 4 has digit sum 7 which is not a square, and the same is the case for k = 5, 7 and 8. (Only k = 6 would have the required property, with 6^2 = 36 and sum of digits 3 + 6 = 9 = 3^2, a square.)
%e A293832 The consecutive integers { 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 } have squares 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225 which all have a digit sum which is a square, namely: 9, 1, 4, 9, 16, 16 and 9. Therefore a(n) = 9 starts the first run of n consecutive integers with this property, for n = 4 through 7.
%e A293832 (Actually, 10^s - 1 starts a run of 7 such numbers for all squares s = m^2: for s > 1, the number itself has a square of the form 9...980...01 with s-1 '9's, so it has digit sum 9*s = (3m)^2, and the subsequent numbers (10^s + k), 0 <= k <= 5, have squares with the same digit sums as 10 through 15: for s = 2 (to avoid the overlap), the squares are 10201, 10404, 10609, 10816 and 11025, while 106^2 = 11236 has digit sum 13, breaking the run.)
%e A293832 One can check that the first run of 8 such numbers is (46045846, ..., 46045853), whence a(8) = 46045846.
%o A293832 (PARI) A293832(n,k=0)=until(, forstep(j=n,1,-1, issquare(sumdigits((k+j)^2)) || next(2+!k+=j)); return(k+1)) \\ Takes ~ 1.5 sec for a(8).
