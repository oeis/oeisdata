%N A293107 Irregular triangle read by rows: universal linear relationships among polynomial means for even degrees.
%C A293107 Irregular triangular array of coefficients of universal linear relationships among means of all even-degree (complex-valued) polynomials, beginning with degree = 4 at top of triangle. Let phi(D,d,r) denote the mean of a generic degree D polynomial's order d derivative averaged over the (D-r) roots of the order r derivative of the polynomial. The tabulated coefficients, c(-), satisfy Sum_{k=1..(D-d-1)} c(k)*phi(D,d,k) = 0, with d always equal to 0. The first row of the triangle has 3 entries, while each subsequent row has an additional 2 entries.
%C A293107 Results have been computed in all degrees up to D=49, observing: (1) in all even degrees beyond 2, there is a single such linear relationship; (2) in all odd degrees beyond 3, there is a 2-dimensional family of such linear relationships.
%C A293107 In each row of the triangle, the sum of all positive coefficients equals the sum of all negative coefficients.
