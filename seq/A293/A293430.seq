%N A293430 Persistently squarefree numbers for base-2 shifting: Numbers n such that all terms in finite set [n, floor(n/2), floor(n/4), floor(n/8), ..., 1] are squarefree.
%C A293430 Question: Is this sequence infinite? (My guess: yes). This is equivalent to questions asked in A293230. See also comments at A293441 and A293517.
%C A293430 For any odd n that is present, 2n is also present.

%e A293430 For 479 we see that 479 is prime (thus squarefree, in A005117), [479/2] = 239 is also a prime, [239/2] = 119 = 7*17 (a squarefree composite), [119/2] = 59 (a prime), [59/2] = 29 (a prime), [29/2] = 14 = 2*7 (a squarefree composite), [14/2] = 7 (a prime), [7/2] = 3 (a prime), [3/2] = 1 (the end of halving process 1 is also squarefree), thus all the values obtained by repeated halving were squarefree and 479 is a member of this sequence. Here [ ] stands for taking floor.
