%N A268463 Least number of steps required in 2D prime walk for it to cross itself n times.
%C A268463 The 2D prime walk on the square grid is constructed as follows. Iterate through the positive integers starting with 1. When you encounter a nonprime the walk goes straight, when you encounter a prime it turns right.
%C A268463 The longest known gap between two consecutive visits is 12741511, when step 25980222 revisits the cell of step 13238712.
%C A268463 The longest known Manhattan distance from the origin is 311534, which occurs at step 1222232279.

%e A268463 a(1)=15, because step 15 is the first time the walk crosses itself (at cell of step 3).
%e A268463 a(2)=35, because step 35 is the first time the walk crosses itself twice.
