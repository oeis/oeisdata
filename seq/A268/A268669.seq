%N A268669 a(n) = polynomial quotient (computed over GF(2), result is its binary encoding) that is left after all instances of polynomial (X+1) have been factored out of the polynomial that is encoded by the binary expansion of n. (See comments for details).
%C A268669 When polynomials over GF(2) are encoded in the binary representation of n in a natural way where each polynomial b(n)*X^n+...+b(0)*X^0 over GF(2) is represented by the binary number b(n)*2^n+...+b(0)*2^0 in N (each coefficient b(k) is either 0 or 1), then a(n) = representation of the polynomial that is left as a quotient when all X+1 polynomials (encoded by 3, "11" in binary) have been divided out.
%C A268669 Each a(n) is one of the "Garden of Eden" patterns of Rule-60 one-dimensional cellular automaton, a seed pattern which after A268389(n) generations yields the configuration encoded in binary expansion of n.
%C A268669 No terms of A001969 occur so all terms are odious (in A000069). Each odious number occurs an infinitely many times.

%F A268669 If A006068(n) is odd, then a(n) = n, otherwise a(n) = a(A006068(n)/2).
%F A268669 Other identities and observations. For all n >= 1:
%F A268669 a(n) = A003188(A268670(n)).
%F A268669 A010060(a(n)) = 1. [All terms are odious.]
%F A268669 a(n) <= n.
%F A268669 More precisely, a(A000069(n)) = A000069(n) and a(A001969(n)) < A001969(n).
%F A268669 The equivalence of the following two formulas stems from the additive nature of Rule-60 cellular automaton. Or more plainly, because carryless binary multiplication A048720 distributes over carryless binary sum, XOR A003987:
%F A268669 A048724^A268389(n) (a(n)) = n. [Starting from k = a(n), and iterating map k -> A048724(k) exactly A268389(n) times yields n back.]
%F A268669 A048720(a(n),A048723(3,A268389(n))) = A048720(a(n),A001317(A268389(n))) = n.
%e A268669 For n = 5 ("101" in binary) which encodes polynomial x^2 + 1, we observe that it can be factored in ring GF(2)[X] as (X+1)(X+1), and thus a(5) = 1, because after dividing both instances of (X+1) off, we are left with the quotient polynomial 1 which is encoded by 1.
%e A268669 For n = 8 ("1000" in binary) which encodes polynomial x^3, we observe that it is not divisible in ring GF(2)[X] by polynomial X+1, thus a(8) = 8.
%e A268669 For n = 9 ("1001" in binary) which encodes polynomial x^3 + 1, we observe that it can be factored over GF(2) as (X+1)(X^2 + X + 1), and thus a(9) = 7, because the quotient polynomial X^2 + X + 1 is encoded by 7 ("111" in binary).
