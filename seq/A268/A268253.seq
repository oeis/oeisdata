%N A268253 a(n) begins the first chain of 5 consecutive positive integers of h-values with symmetrical gaps about the center, where h(k) is the length of the finite sequence k, f(k), f(f(k)), ..., 1 in the Collatz (or 3x + 1) problem.
%C A268253 a(1) = A078441(5).
%C A268253 Or numbers k such that h(k) + h(k+4) = h(k+1) + h(k+3) and h(k+2) = (h(k) + h(k+4))/2, where h(k) is the length of k, f(k), f(f(k)), ..., 1 in the Collatz (or 3x + 1) problem.
%C A268253 The 5-tuple of consecutive h(k) are symmetric about the central value h(k+2) which are averages of both their immediate neighbors and their second neighbors.
%C A268253 A majority of numbers generate trivial 5-tuples {m, m, m, m, m}.
%C A268253 The 5-tuples {h(k)} of the form {m, p, p, p, q} are generated by the numbers of the sequence 507, 1003, ...
%C A268253 The 5-tuples {h(k)} of the form {m, p, m, q, m} are generated by the numbers of the sequence 1272, 3672, ...

%e A268253 In 5-tuple of consecutive {h(k)}: {h(1272),h(1273),h(1274),h(1275),h(1276)} = {57,31,57,83,57}, the central value is 57, and 57+57 = 31+83 = 2*57. Hence, 1272 is in the sequence.
%e A268253 Alternatively, the symmetry can be seen from the differences between consecutive {h(k)}. For {57,31,57,83,57}, the differences {h(k+1)-h(k)} are {-26,26,26,-26}.
