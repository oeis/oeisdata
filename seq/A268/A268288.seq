%N A268288 a(n) begins the first chain of 9 consecutive positive integers of h-values with symmetrical gaps about the center, where h(k) is the length of the finite sequence k, f(k), f(f(k)), ...., 1 in the Collatz (or 3x + 1) problem.
%C A268288 a(1) = A078441(9).
%C A268288 The 9-tuple of consecutive h(k) are symmetric about the central value h(k+4) which are averages of both their immediate neighbors, their second neighbors, their third neighbors and their fourth neighbors.
%C A268288 A majority of numbers the sequence generate trivial 9-tuples (m, m, m, m, m, m, m, m, m).
%C A268288 For a(n) < 200000, the following sets have been identified:
%C A268288 The 9-tuples {h(k)} of the form {m, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, q} are generated by the numbers of the sequence 12608, 16915, 39169, ...
%C A268288 The 9-tuples {h(k)} of the form {m, p, q, q, q, q, q, m, p} are generated by the numbers of the sequence 40553, ...
%C A268288 The 9-tuples {h(k)} of the form {m, p, p, p, q, m, m, m, p} are generated by the numbers of the sequence 55107, 124739, ...
%C A268288 The 9-tuples {h(k)} of the form {m, m, m, m, p, q, q, q, q} are generated by the numbers of the sequence 55292, 90396, 118109, ...
%C A268288 The 9-tuples {h(k)} of the form {m, m, m, p, m, q, m, m, m} are generated by the numbers of the sequence 58756, 71236, 79428, ...
%C A268288 The 9-tuples {h(k)} of the form {m, m, p, m, m, m, q, m, m} are generated by the numbers of the sequence 78021, ...
%C A268288 The 9-tuples {h(k)} of the form {m, p, m, m, m, m, m, q, m} are generated by the numbers of the sequence 93600, 124768, ...
%C A268288 The 9-tuples {h(k)} of the form {m, m, m, p, p, p, q, q, q} are generated by the numbers of the sequence 160705, ...
%e A268288 In 9-tuple of consecutive h(k): {h(55107),h(55108),...,h(55115)} = {184,60,60,60,122,184,184,184,60}, the central value is 122, and 184+60 = 2*122. Hence, 55107 is in the sequence.
%e A268288 Alternatively, the symmetry can be seen from the differences between consecutive h(k). For {184,60,60,60,122,184,184,184,60}, the differences h(k+1)-h(k) are (-124,0,0,62,62,0,0,-124).
