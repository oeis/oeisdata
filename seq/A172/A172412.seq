%N A172412 Multiples of 4 with the property that addition of a square gives a square that is not larger than the square for any later term.
%C A172412 For each integer n one can define smallest-next-square function S(n) such that S(n) is a perfect square, S(n) >=n, and such that S(n)-n is also a perfect square. If there are more such S(n), take the smallest, use -1 if this S(n) does not exist.
%C A172412 This S(n) starts for n>=0 as 0, 1, -1, 4, 4, 9, -1, 16, 9, 9, -1, 36, 16, 49, -1, 16, 16, 81,...
%C A172412 The locations of the -1 are in A016825.
%C A172412 The quadrisection S(4n) is S(0)=0, S(4)=4, S(8)=9, S(12)=16, S(16)=16, S(20)=36, S(24)=25, S(28)=64.
%C A172412 The sequence shows the arguments 4n of this quadrisection for which S(4n) is not larger than any S(4n') for n'>n.
%C A172412 Evidently, the sequence is a subsequence of A008586.
%e A172412 S(20) =36 is larger than S(24), so 20 is not in the sequence. S(28)=64 is larger than S(32)=36, so 28 is not in the sequence.
