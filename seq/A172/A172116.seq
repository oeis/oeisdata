%N A172116 The smallest number without double base representation of length n.
%C A172116 Portion of abstract from Dimitrov/Howe reference: A double-base representation of an integer n is an expression n = n_1 + ... + n_r, where the n_i are (positive or negative) integers that are divisible by no primes other than 2 or 3; the length of the representation is the number r of terms. It is known that there is a constant a > 0 such that every integer n has a double-base representation of length at most a log n / log log n.

%e A172116 For example, 103 can be written in many ways as the sum of 3 integers, each with no prime divisors other than 2 and 3 (e.g. 103 = (-1) + (-4) + 108), but it cannot be written as the sum of 2 such integers.  103 is the smallest positive integer that requires more than 2 terms.
