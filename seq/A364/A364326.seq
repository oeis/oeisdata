%N A364326 Underline the k-th digit of a(n), k being the rightmost digit of a(n). This is the lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct terms > 0 such that the succession of the underlined digit is the succession of the sequence's digits themselves.
%e A364326 The rightmost digit of a(1) = 1 is 1: this digit underlines the 1st digit of a(1) which is (1);
%e A364326 The rightmost digit of a(2) = 11 is 1: this digit underlines the 1st digit of a(2) which is (1);
%e A364326 The rightmost digit of a(3) = 101 is 1: this digit underlines the 1st digit of a(3) which is (1);
%e A364326 The rightmost digit of a(4) = 111 is 1: this digit underlines the 1st digit of a(4) which is (1);
%e A364326 The rightmost digit of a(5) = 102 is 2: this digit underlines the 2nd digit of a(5) which is (0);
%e A364326 The rightmost digit of a(6) = 112 is 2: this digit underlines the 2nd digit of a(6) which is (1); etc.
%e A364326 We see that the parenthesized digits at the end of each line reproduce the succession of the original digits.
