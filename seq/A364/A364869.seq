%N A364869 Numbers k such that 6*k+1 is the norm of an Eisenstein prime.
%C A364869 Numbers k such that 6*k+1 is a prime or the square of a prime congruent to 5 modulo 6.
%C A364869 If p is an Eisenstein prime of norm 6*a(n)+1 (there are two up to association if a(n) is a prime, one if a(n) is the square of a prime), then for any Eisenstein integer x, we have x^a(n) == 0, 1, w, w^2, -1, -w or -w^2 (mod p), where w = (1+sqrt(-3))/2 is a primitive sixth root of unity.
