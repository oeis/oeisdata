%N A364607 Denominations of a 4-coin system that returns the fewest coins in change on average.
%C A364607 In 1995, Thomas Young, along with students Jeff Greenfield, Joe Culbert, and David Raabe, explored the idea of the best 4-coin system for making change for a dollar.  They assumed that each value for change (from 1 cent to 99 cents) was equally likely and, using an original Turbo Pascal program, calculated the average number of coins returned for every possible set of 4 coin denominations.  Their result was announced via the essay, "Change the Dime not the Dollar."
%C A364607 The average number of coins required to return 1..99 cents is A339333(99,4)/99 = 389/99. - _Pontus von Brömssen_, Aug 13 2023
