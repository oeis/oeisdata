%N A364749 a(1) = 1. Thereafter, if a(n-1) is a novel term a(n) = a(a(n-1)), otherwise a(n) is the number of times a(n-1) has been repeated.
%C A364749 Based on A346175, except that this sequence has offset 1, and begins a(1) = 1. When a(n-1) is a repeated term, seen k times up to and including itself, a(n) = k-1, the number of repeats of a(n-1). A record term a(m) = r beyond a(2) arises consequent to a(m-1) = 1, and is the number of times 1 has been repeated so far. The subsequence {a(r)} recovers the original sequence, which is fractal. The records subsequence is A000027.

%e A364749 a(1) = 1 is a novel term, seen for the first time, so a(2) = a(a(1)) = a(1) = 1. 1 has now been repeated once so a(3) = 1. Now 1 has been repeated twice, so a(4) = 2, a novel term, meaning that a(5) = a(a(4)) = a(2) = 1.
%e A364749 The sequence can be represented as an irregular table wherein row n starts with the n-th record term and ends with a 1 prior to the next record term, which starts the next row. The first column of the table is the records subsequence, A000027, and the second column is a copy the sequence itself.
