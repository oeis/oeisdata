%N A364154 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive integers such that a(n) is least novel multiple m of the product of all primes less than the greatest prime factor of a(n-1) which do not divide a(n-1); a(1) = 1.
%C A364154 It follows from the definition that the sequence is infinite, and that the records (outside of the first 7 terms) are all primorial numbers, meaning that it grows very quickly.
%C A364154 When there are no primes less than the greatest prime factor of a(n-1) which do not divide a(n-1) then m is the least novel multiple of 1, the empty product, and therefore a(n) = u, the least unused number in the sequence so far. The only way a prime can enter the sequence is as u. When a(n-1) = prime(k), a(n) is A002110(k-1), and any primorial term is followed by u. Thus: prime -> primorial -> u.
%C A364154 Sequence is a permutation of the positive integers since by the definition no number appears more than once and m = 1 eventually introduces any number not already placed by the first part of the definition (m > 1).

Under the plot, we indicate the empty product in black, primes in red, composite prime powers in gold, squarefree composites in green, and all other numbers in blue.
%e A364154 a(1) = 1 and there are no primes < 1 which divide 1 therefore m = 1 so a(2) = 2, the least unused number. Likewise a(3) = 3.
%e A364154 a(4) = 2*2 = 4 since 2 is the only prime < 3 which does not divide 3 and 2 has already occurred.
%e A364154 Since a(7) = 7, a(8) = 2*3*5 = 30.
