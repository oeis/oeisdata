%N A364779 Largest integer with sum of digits n in fractional base 4/3.
%C A364779 A largest integer exists since only a finite number of trailing 0 digits are possible, since each is a factor 4/3.
%C A364779 Each term k >= 3 has final digit d = k mod 4 which is always d < r where r = k mod 3 (and hence d = 0 or 1), since otherwise (k - r)*4/3 + r would split d into two final digits {d-r, r} for a larger number with the same sum of digits.
%C A364779 This sequence is strictly increasing since final digit d = 0 or 1 (and also a(2) = 2) can be incremented so that a(n)+1 is a candidate value for a(n+1).
