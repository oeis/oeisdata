%N A364036 a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0; for n > 1, a(n) is the number of pairs of consecutive terms prior to a(n-1) that sum to the same value as a(n-2) + a(n-1).
%C A364036 The same number cannot occur four times in a row as the second pair in a triplet of the same numbers increments the appearance count of the first pair by one, so the fourth number is always one more than the previous three numbers.
%C A364036 The occurrences of three consecutive equal numbers is quite rare, only occurring thirteen times in the first 20 million terms. The last such triplet is a(3620001) = a(3620002) = a(3620003) = 1159. It is likely such triplets occur infinitely often although this is unknown.
