%N A364555 Numbers m such that no triangular number is m times a prime.
%C A364555 Numbers m such that A364554(m) = 0.
%C A364555 Primes in sequence are A109998.
%C A364555 Conjecture: Numbers m such that there is no prime number in the union of all sets {(2*r -+ 1)/d; (r -+ 1)/(2*d)}, where d is some divisor of m and r = m/d.
%e A364555 17 is a term since there isn't any triangular number T(k) such that T(k) = 17*p, with p prime.
