%N A364202 Integers m which can be written as m = p*q = r*s, with 1 <= r < p < q < s <= m and satisfying (p+q) | (s-r).
%C A364202 Terms may have multiple solutions p,q,r,s, and each has a least quotient k = (s-r) / (p+q).
%C A364202 Those with k=1 are the congruent numbers (A003273) and others are a more general case.
%C A364202 They all share a simple inter-square characterization. The 4 squares are A = (q-p)^2, B = (p+q)^2, C = ((p+q)*k)^2 and D = (r+s)^2. We have B = A + 4m, C = B*(k^2) and D = C + 4m, where 4m is added exclusively to avoid the use of fractions.

%e A364202 21 is a term since 21 = 3*7 = 1*21 which has 3+7 = 10 divides 21-1 = 20 (k=2).
%e A364202 So there are 4 squares, in this case, 16, 100, 400 and 484, which are related by this number. In effect, 4*21=+84 jumps from the first to the second, which, multiplied by k^2, gives the third, where +84 gives the fourth.
