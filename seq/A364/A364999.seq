%N A364999 Numbers k neither squarefree nor prime power such that both rad(k)*A119288(k) > k and rad(k)*A053669(k) > k.
%C A364999 Subset of A126706, numbers that are neither squarefree nor prime powers.
%C A364999 For k in this sequence, let p = A119288(k), q = A053669(k), and r = A007947(k).
%C A364999 A355432(k) = A360543(k) = 0. There exist neither nondivisor m < k such that rad(m) = rad(k), nor m < k, gcd(m,k) > 1 such that both omega(k) > omega(m) and rad(m) | k.
%C A364999 Apparently this is A081770 without the leading 4. - _R. J. Mathar_, Sep 05 2023

Terms in this sequence are colored black, those in A364998 in gold, in A364997 in green, and in A361098 in red.

Terms in this sequence are colored black, else white. Demonstrates fairly constant density of a(n) in A126706 as well as a slight quasiperiodic pattern approximately mod 169.
%F A364999 Intersection of A363082 and A360767.
%e A364999 Let b(n) = A126706(n), S = A360767, and T = A363082.
%e A364999 b(1) = a(1) = 12 since p*r = 3*6 = 18 and q*r = 5*6 = 30, and both exceed 12. Indeed, 12 is in both S and T.
%e A364999 b(2) = 18 is not in the sequence since p*r = 3*6 = 18; 18 is not in S.
%e A364999 b(6) = 36 is not in the sequence since p*r = 3*6 = 18 and q*r = 5*6, and both do not exceed 36.
%e A364999 b(7) = 40 is not in the sequence since p*r = 5*10 = 50 and q*r = 3*10 = 30. Though 50 > 40, 30 < 40, and is not in T, etc.
