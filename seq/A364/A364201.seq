%N A364201 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive integers such that the sum of all terms a(1)..a(n) in binary is a substring of the concatenation of all terms a(1)..a(n) in binary.
%C A364201 In the first 10000 terms the smallest number that has not yet appeared is 7026; it is conjectured all numbers eventually appear.
%C A364201 The fixed points begin 1, 2, 3, 29, 48, 68, 96, 182, 471, 839, ... . It is likely there are infinitely more.
