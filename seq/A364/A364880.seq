%N A364880 a(0) = 0. If a(n-1) is a novel term, a(n) = a(a(n-1)); otherwise a(n) is the number of distinct terms occurring prior to a(n-1) which are <= a(n-1).
%C A364880 The novel terms are all records so the records subsequence is A000027.
%C A364880 Following each record term r, the sequence resets to a(r) then increments to novel term r+1, which introduces a(r+1), and so on (compare with A002262, which resets to 0 after each record).
%C A364880 The proper subsequence {a(a(r))} is a copy of the original, which therefore is fractal.

%H A364880 Michael De Vlieger, <a href="/A364880/a364880_1.png">Scatterplot of a(n)</a>, n = 0..2047 with the same color approach used above, but only labeling T(n,1).
%e A364880 a(0) = 0 is a novel term, so a(1) = a(a(0)) = a(0) = 0.
%e A364880 a(2) = 1 because there is just one distinct prior term (0) which is <= 0.
%e A364880 Since a(2) = 1 is a novel term, a(3) = a(a(2)) = a(1) = a(0) = 0.
%e A364880 a(4) = 1 because a(3) = 0 is a repeat term and there is only one distinct term (0) <= 0.
%e A364880 The sequence can be represented as an irregular table in which each row starts with a record term, and ends with the first repeat of the same number. The first column is A000027, and the second column is the sequence itself:
