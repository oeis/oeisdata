%N A367150 Results of the strip bijection as described in A307110 with subsequent reassignment of the pair connections at all locations, in which 4 points of a unit square in one grid are mapped to a unit square in the other (rotated by Pi/4) grid in such a way that the maximum distance of the two points in the 4 assigned pairs is minimized.
%C A367150 The strip bijection of A307110 assigns each grid point in one grid to a unique grid point in the rotated grid. The mapping therefore corresponds to a permutation of the nonnegative integers. Approximately 2/3 of the grid points are mapped in such a way that 4 points that form a unit square in the original grid also form a unit square after being mapped onto the rotated grid. We call this a stable (grid) cell under the bijection map. The method differs from that used in A307731 in that for each stable cell it is tried whether the maximum of the 4 pair distances resulting from the application of strip bijection can be reduced by a cyclic rotation of the connections. The one of the two assignments by cyclic connection change is selected that provides a smaller maximum of the 4 distances in the pairs assigned to each other. In contrast, a cyclic rotation of the connections is only carried out in the method of A307731 if the maximum of the 4 distances exceeds the upper limit of the bijection distance of sqrt(5)*sin(Pi/8)=0.855706... (A386241).
