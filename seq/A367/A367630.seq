%N A367630 Numbers k such that at least one 3-smooth number with k prime factors (counted with multiplicity) is the average of a twin prime pair.
%C A367630 Equivalently, numbers k for which there is at least one j such that 2^j * 3^(k-j) is the average of a twin prime pair.
%C A367630 The only even term is 2: the corresponding twin prime pairs are 2^2 * 3^0 -+ 1 = (3,5) and 2^1 * 3^1 -+ 1 = (5,7), each of which includes 5 as an element of the pair. If k is even, 2^j * 3^(k-j) differs by 1 from a multiple of 5 for every j.
%e A367630 5 is a term: 2^3 * 3^2 = 8*9 = 72 is the average of a twin prime pair (and the same is true of 2^2 * 3^3 = 4*27 = 108).
