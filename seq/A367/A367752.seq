%N A367752 Number of shapes of labeled rooted hypertrees with n vertices.
%C A367752 The shape of a labeled rooted hypertree is a labeled rooted hypertrees where we replace all the maximal subtrees by a corolla rooted on a new unlabeled black vertex.
%C A367752 If we remove the black vertices that are the parent of only 1 white vertex, we obtain labeled rooted hypertrees with black and white vertices such that:
%C A367752   - black vertices are unlabeled;
%C A367752   - black vertices have at least two children;
%C A367752   - the children of a black vertex are white, and are connected to it via simple edges (edges connecting only two vertices);
%C A367752   - the children of a white vertex are connected to it via hyperedges (edges connecting strictly more than two vertices).
%F A367752 E.g.f.: series reversion of log(1+x)*exp(-exp(x)+x+1).
%e A367752 For n = 3 the a(3) = 4 solutions are:
%e A367752   - the corolla with a black root which have 3 white children,
%e A367752   - and the 3 possible labeling of the hypertree with a white root which have 2 white children connected to it via a hyperedge.
