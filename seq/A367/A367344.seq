%N A367344 Compute the commas sequence starting at 1, as in A121805, except do the calculations in octal. The terms are written here in octal (see also A367343).
%e A367344 The first three terms are 1, 12, 35 in octal, and we check that around the first comma we see 1,1_8 which becomes 11_8 = 9_10, and 1_10 + 9_10 = 10_10 = 12_8 = a(2).
%e A367344 Around the second comma we see 2,3_8, which becomes 23_8 = 19_10, and indeed 12_8 + 23_8 = 10_10 + 19_10 = 29_10 = 35_8 = a(3).
%Y A367344 Cf. A121805, A367343.
