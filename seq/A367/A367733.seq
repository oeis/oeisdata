%N A367733 Numbers k such that the sum of digits of k is equal to the sum of digits of k+9.
%C A367733 Numbers k which end in the digits ...xy with x!=9 and y!=0.
%C A367733 Differs from A052382, as there are terms with 0 here, the first being a(82)=101. First differs from A067251 at a(82)=101, A067251(82)=91. Similarly to A067251, A209931 includes 91-99 as terms whereas they are not in this sequence. A043095(1)=0 and A023804(1)=0 whereas 0 is not a term in this sequence (there are additional differences, such as the term that comes after 89 in A023804 and A043095 being 99).
%C A367733 This sequence is defined as follows: |digsum(k + seed) - digsum(k)| = r where digsum is the digital sum (A007953), with seed = 9 and r = 0.
%C A367733 The way this sequence looks has to do with using base 10: if you choose 8 as a seed and 1 as the sought difference (r), or 7 as a seed and 2 as the sought difference, you will get similar long, full sequences. However if you choose 8 as a seed and 0 as the sought difference, you'll get no terms.
%F A367733 a(n) = n + floor((n-1)/9) + floor((n-1)/81)*10.
%e A367733 For k=3, 3 + 9 = 12. Sum of 1 + 2 = 3. Since the sum of the digits in 3 and the sum of the digits in 12 are the same, 3 is a term of the sequence.
