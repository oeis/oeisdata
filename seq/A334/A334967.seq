%N A334967 Numbers k such that the every subsequence (not necessarily contiguous) of the k-th composition in standard order (A066099) has a different sum.
%C A334967 First differs from A333223 in lacking 41.
%C A334967 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
%e A334967 The sequence together with the corresponding compositions begins:
