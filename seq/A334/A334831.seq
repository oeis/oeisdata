%N A334831 Number of binary words of length n that avoid abelian 4th powers circularly.
%C A334831 A word w of length n avoids abelian K-th powers circularly if every abelian K-th power in w^{K+1} has a block length of at least n. An abelian 4th power means a concatenation of four blocks that are permutations of each other, e.g., (011)(101)(110)(101) is an abelian 4th power of block length 3.

%e A334831 a(6) = 6, and the words are 000111, 001110, 011100 and their complements. The word w = 010011 does not avoid abelian 4th powers circularly because w^3 has abelian 4th power of period 2 starting at position 6.
