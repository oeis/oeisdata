%N A334810 The number of even numbers between 4 and 2p that cannot be written as the sum of two primes less than or equal to the n-th prime number p.
%C A334810 This sequence is related to the Goldbach conjecture: any even number (m) greater than 4 can be written as the sum of two odd primes (i.e., m = p1 + p2). For any given prime number p, if the restriction (p1, p2 <= p) is applied, some even numbers less than 2p may not be written as the sum of two prime numbers. The prime numbers corresponding to a(n)=0 in this sequence are the seven prime numbers listed in A301776.

%e A334810 a(1)=0. The 1st prime is 2. Even number 4 can be written as 2+2.
%e A334810 a(2)=0. The 2nd prime is 3. Even numbers 4 and 6 can be written as: 4=2+2 and 6=3+3.
%e A334810 a(3)=0. The 3rd prime is 5. Even numbers between 4 and 10 are: 4=2+2, 6=3+3, 8=3+5, and 10=5+5.
%e A334810 a(5)=1. The 5th prime is 11. Among the 10 even numbers between 4 and 22, only 20 cannot be written as the sum of two primes <= 11.
%e A334810 a(10)=4. The 10th prime is 29. Four even numbers (44, 50, 54, and 56) between 4 and 58 cannot be written as the sum of two primes <= 29.

%Y A334810 Cf. A301776 (prime numbers p with the property that all even numbers n (2 < n <= 2p) are the sum of two primes <= p).
