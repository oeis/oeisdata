%N A334876 Numbers n with the property that sigma(2^n+1)/(2^n+1) > sigma(2^k+1)/(2^k+1) for all k < n with sigma(n) being A000203(n), the sum of the divisors of n.
%C A334876 Set h(n)= sigma(n)/n. Then the sequence is the n which are record setters for h(2^n+1). This sequence is essentially defined similarly to A004394 but restricted to looking just at numbers which are one more than a power of 2.
%C A334876 The sequence is infinite. This can be proved by seeing that we can make h(2^n+1) arbitrarily large. Note that if p is a prime which is 3 (mod 8), then p|2^n+1 for any odd n where (p-1)/2|n. By the strong version of Dirichlet's theorem the sum of the reciprocals of the primes which are 3 mod 8 diverges. So we can make h(2^n+1) arbitrarily large by taking n as the largest odd divisor of k! for large k.
%C A334876 It appears that every term in the sequence is odd. This seems likely to be true since if n is even then 2^n+1 is not divisible by 3 which makes it much harder to make h(2^n+1) large.
