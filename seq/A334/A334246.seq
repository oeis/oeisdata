%N A334246 A triple of positive integers (n,p,k) is admissible if there exist at least two different multisets of k positive integers, {x_1,x_2,...,x_k} and {y_1,y_2,...,y_k}, such that x_1+x_2+...+x_k = y_1+y_2+...+y_k = n and x_1x_2...x_k = y_1y_2...y_k = p. For each n, let A(n) = {(p,k):(n,p,k) is admissible for some k}; then  a(n) = |A(n)|.
%C A334246 _J. H. Conway_ proposed an interesting math puzzle in the 1960s, which is now generally known as "Conway's wizard problem." Here is the problem.
%C A334246 Last night I sat behind two wizards on a bus and overheard the following:
%C A334246 Blue Wizard: I have a positive integer number of children, whose ages are positive integers. The sum of their ages is the number of this bus, while the product is my own age.
%C A334246 Red Wizard: How interesting! Perhaps if you told me your age and the number of your children, I could work out their individual ages?
%C A334246 Blue Wizard: No, you could not.
%C A334246 Red Wizard: Aha! At last, I know how old you are!
%C A334246 Apparently the Red Wizard had been trying to determine the Blue Wizard's age for some time. Now, what was the number of the bus?
%C A334246 This problem posed by Conway looks at different multisets that correspond to the same ordered triple, which motivated the study of this sequence.
%C A334246 The number n for which a(n)=1 gives the solution to Conway's puzzle.
