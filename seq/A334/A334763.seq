%N A334763 Ceiling of circumradius of triangle whose sides are consecutive Ulam numbers (A002858).
%C A334763 It has been proved that three consecutive Ulam numbers U(n) for n > 1 satisfy the triangle inequality. See Wikipedia link below. Consequently it is possible to create n-gons using n consecutive Ulam numbers. The sequence starts at offset 2 because using the first Ulam number generates a triangle with sides (1,2,3) that is degenerate with infinite circumradius.
%C A334763 Conjecture: Triangles whose sides are consecutive Ulam numbers are acute apart from (1,2,3), (2,3,4), (3,4,6), (4,6,8), (6,8,11) and (16,18,26).

%F A334763 Circumradius of a triangle with sides a, b, c is given by R = a*b*c/(4A) where the Area A is given by Heron's formula A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)) and where s = (a+b+c)/2.
%e A334763 a(2)=3 because a triangle with sides 2,3,4 has area = (1/4)*sqrt((2+3+4)(2+3-4)(2-3+4)(-2+3+4)) = 2.904... and circumradius = 2*3*4/(4A) = 2.065...
