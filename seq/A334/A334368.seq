%N A334368 Number of proper divisors of n such that d, n/d and n-d are all squarefree.
%C A334368 a(p^k) = mu(p-1)^2 for k = 1 or 2, and 0 for k > 2.
%F A334368 a(n) = Sum_{d|n, d<n} mu(d)^2 * mu(n/d)^2 * mu(n-d)^2, where mu is the Möebius function (A008683).
%e A334368 a(41) = 0; There are no such divisors of 41 since 1 and 41 are squarefree, but 41 - 1 = 40 is not.
%e A334368 a(42) = 4; The four divisors of 42 that meet all three conditions are 1, 3, 7 and 21.
%e A334368 a(43) = 1; The only divisor of 43 that meets all three conditions is 1.
%e A334368 a(44) = 2; The two divisors of 44 that meet all three conditions are 2 and 22.
