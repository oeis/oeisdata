%N A334251 a(n) is the number of binary (0,1) sequences of length n that have at most two zeros in a window of seven consecutive symbols.
%C A334251 Application: Not all electronic devices connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) have batteries or are connected to the power cable. These self-contained devices must rely on the harvesting of energy of the signals sent by a transmitter. We investigate binary systems emitting 0's and 1's signals where it is assumed that the 1's carry the energy. A minimal number of 1's in transmitted sequences is required so as to carry sufficient energy within a prescribed time span. A binary sequence is said to obey the sliding-window (ell,t)-constraint if the number of 1's within any window of ell consecutive bits of that sequence is at least t, t<ell.

%F A334251 a(n) ~ c*r^n where c = 1.81880731105 and r = 1.498122533939865577.
%F A334251 a(n) = a(n - 1) + a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 10) - a(n - 12) - 3*a(n - 13) - a(n - 15) + a(n - 18) + a(n - 21), n >= 21. (End)
%e A334251 a(3) = 7 as there are 8 possible binary (0,1) sequences of length 3 but exactly one of them has more than 2 zero's in a window of seven consecutive symbols (the sequence (000)) leaving 8-1 = 7 such sequences. - _David A. Corneth_, Apr 20 2020
