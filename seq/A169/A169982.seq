%e A169982 At length 1, 9 has one divisor, 9 itself.
%e A169982 At length 2, all 18 9-ish numbers N are lunar primes and therefore have two divisors, 9 and N.
%e A169982 At length 3, 998 and many others have 4 divisors.
%e A169982 At length 4, just 4 numbers have 14 divisors, namely 9988, 8988, 8899, 8898.
%e A169982 At length 5, there is a unique number with 41 divisors, 88988.
%e A169982 At length 9, there is a unique number with 222 divisors, 99999.
%Y A169982 Cf. A169983 (which is a lower bound).
