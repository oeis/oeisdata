%N A035027 Greatest integer that is <= the sum of the n-th powers of its digits.
%C A035027 If we suppress trailing 9's, we get the strings 0, 0, 1, 1, 22, 2, 2, 2, 2, 30, 30, 30, 2, 2, 2, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 20, 1, 1, 17, 17, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 102, 0, 090, 081, 075, 06, 064, 05, 055 for n up to 40; also (as correctly reported by Stewart) 000251 for a(100). Here one should pad with 9's until obtaining exactly n+1 digits. This sequence of digit strings cannot be conveniently represented in the OEIS because the number of leading 0's is significant! - _Don Knuth_, Sep 07 2015
%H A035027 B. M. Stewart, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.4153/CJM-1960-032-9">Sums of functions of digits</a>, Canad. J. Math., 12 (1960), 374-389. - _Don Knuth_, Sep 07 2015
%e A035027 2^5 + 2^5 + 9^5 + 9^5 + 9^5 + 9^5 >= 229999 but "<" for all greater integers, so a(5) = 229999.
%e A035027 Stewart, in his Table VI, incorrectly stated that a(5)=299999. - _Don Knuth_, Sep 07 2015
