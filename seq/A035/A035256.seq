%N A035256 Positive integers of the form x^2+3xy-y^2.
%C A035256 This is an indefinite quadratic form of discriminant 13.
%C A035256 Also, positive integers of the form x^2+6xy-4y^2 (an indefinite quadratic form of discriminant 52).
%C A035256 Also, indices of the nonzero terms in expansion of Dirichlet series Product_p (1-(Kronecker(m,p)+1)*p^(-s)+Kronecker(m,p)*p^(-2s))^(-1) for m= 13.
%C A035256 From _Klaus Purath_, May 07 2023: (Start)
%C A035256 Also, positive integers of the form x^2 + (2m+1)xy + (m^2+m-3)y^2, m, x, y integers. This includes the form in the name.
%C A035256 Also, positive integers of the form x^2 + 2mxy + (m^2-13)y^2, m, x, y integers. This includes the form in the comment above.
%C A035256 This sequence contains all squares. The prime factors of the terms except for {2, 5, 7, 11, 19, ...} = A038884 are terms of the sequence. Also the products of terms belong to the sequence. Thus this set of terms is closed under multiplication.
%C A035256 A positive integer N belongs to the sequence if and only if N (modulo 13) is a term of A010376 and, moreover, in the case that prime factors p of N are terms of A038884, they occur only with even exponents. For these prime factors also p (modulo 13) = {2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11} applies. (End)
