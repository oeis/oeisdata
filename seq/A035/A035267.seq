%C A035267 Positive numbers represented by the indefinite quadratic form 3x^2+xy-3y^2, of discriminant 37. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jun 05 2014 [Typo corrected by _Klaus Purath_, Apr 24 2023]
%C A035267 Also positive numbers of the form x^2 + (2m+1)xy + (m^2+m-9)y^2, m, x, y integers. All squares as well as the products of any terms belong to the sequence. Thus, this set of terms is closed under multiplication. - _Klaus Purath_, Apr 24 2023
%C A035267 A positive integer k belongs to the sequence if and only if k (modulo 37) is a term of A010398 and, moreover, in the case that prime factors p of k are terms of A038914, they occur only with even exponents. Or, more briefly, any positive integer is a term of this sequence if none of its divisors is an odd power of primes from A038914. For these primes also p (modulo 37) = {2, 5, 6, 8, 13, ...} = A028750 applies. - _Klaus Purath_, May 12 2023
