%N A185979 Numbers which are the sum of two positive triangular numbers in more than one way.
%C A185979 This is a subsequence of A020756 (sums of two triangular numbers).
%C A185979 This is also a subsequence of A051533 (sums of two positive triangular numbers). This is not a subsequence of A185978 (nontriangular numbers as sums of (positive) triangular numbers). E.g., a(32)=231 is missing there because 231=A000217(21). See A185980.
%C A185979 For the numbers which are sums of two positive triangular numbers in exactly two ways see A064816.
%C A185979 The first number which can be written in exactly three ways as sums of positive triangular numbers is 81.
%C A185979 a(n) gives the positions where A052344 entries are >= 2: A052344(a(n)) >= 2.
