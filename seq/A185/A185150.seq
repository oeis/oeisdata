%N A185150 Number of odd primes p between n^2 and (n+1)^2 with (n/p) = 1, where (-) is the Legendre symbol.
%C A185150 Conjecture: a(n)>0 for all n>0.
%C A185150 This is a refinement of Legendre's conjecture that for each n=1,2,3,... the interval (n^2,(n+1)^2) contains a prime.
%C A185150 We have verified the conjecture for n up to 10^9.
%C A185150 Zhi-Wei Sun also made some similar conjectures involving primes and Legendre symbols, below are few examples:
%C A185150 (1) If n>10 then there is a prime p between n^2 and (n+1)^2 with (n/p) = ((1-n)/p) = 1. If n>2 is different from 7 and 17, then there is a prime p between n^2 and (n+1)^2 with (n/p) = ((n+1)/p) = 1. If n>1 is not equal to 27, then there is a prime p between n^2 and (n+1)^2 with (n/p) = ((n+2)/p) = 1.
%C A185150 (2) If n>2 is different from 6, 12, 58, then there is a prime p between n^2 and n^2+n such that (n/p) = 1. If n>20 is not a square, and different from 37 and 77, then there is a prime p between n^2 and n^2+n such that (n/p) = -1.
%C A185150 (3) For each n=15,16,... there is a prime p between n and 2n such that (n/p) = 1. If n>0 is not a square, then
%C A185150 there is a prime p between n and 2n such that (n/p) = -1.
