%N A185636 a(n) = |{0 <= k < n: n+k and n+k^2 are both prime}|.
%C A185636 Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n > 1.
%C A185636 This conjecture has been verified for n up to 10^8. It is stronger than Bertrand's postulate proved by Chebyshev in 1850.
%C A185636 Zhi-Wei Sun also guessed the following refinement of the conjecture: For any integer n > 1456 there is an integer k among 0,...,n-1 such that n-k, n+k and n+k^2 are all prime; in other words, there is a prime p <= n such that 2n-p and n+(n-p)^2 are both prime.
%C A185636 For other refinements of the conjecture, the reader may consult arXiv:1211.1588.
%C A185636 The author also conjectured the following polynomial analogs:
%C A185636 (i) For a given integer polynomial f(x) of degree n > 0, there is an integer polynomial g(x) of degree at most n such that f(x)+g(x) and f(x)+g(x)^2 are both irreducible in Z[x].
%C A185636 (ii) Let F be a field with characteristic different from 2 and 3. If f(x) is an irreducible polynomial over F with degree n > 0, then there is a polynomial g(x) over F with deg(g) <= n such that f(x)+g(x)^2 is irreducible over F.
%C A185636 In a 2017 paper, the author announced a USD $100 prize for the first solution to his conjecture that for each n = 1,2,3,... there is an integer k among 0,...,n such that n+k and n+k^2 are both prime. - _Zhi-Wei Sun_, Dec 03 2017
