%N A185645 Number of permutations q_1,...,q_n of the first n primes p_1,...,p_n with q_1 = p_1 = 2 and q_n = p_n, and with |q_1-q_2|, |q_2-q_3|, ..., |q_{n-1}-q_n|, and |q_n-q_1| (if n>2) pairwise distinct.
%C A185645 Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n > 0. In general, for any n consecutive primes p_k,...,p_{k+n-1}, there always exists a permutation q_k,...,q_{k+n-1} of p_k,...,p_{k+n-1} with q_{k+n-1} = p_{k+n-1} such that the n-1 numbers |q_k-q_{k+1}|, |q_{k+1}-q_{k+2}|,...,|q_{k+n-2}-q_{k+n-1}| are pairwise distinct. (In the case k = 2, this implies that a(n) > 0.)
%C A185645 Clearly there is no permutation a,b,c of 3,5,7 such that the three numbers |a-b|,|b-c|,|c-a| are pairwise distinct. Also, for {a,b} = {7,11}, the three numbers |5-a|,|a-b|,|b-13| cannot be pairwise distinct.
%C A185645 On Aug 31 2013, Zhi-Wei Sun proved the following extension of the general conjecture: Let a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n be a sequence of n distinct real numbers in ascending order. Then there is a permutation b_1, ..., b_n of a_1, ..., a_n with b_n = a_n such that |b_1-b_2|, |b_2-b_3|, ..., |b_{n-1}-b_n| are pairwise distinct. In fact, when n = 2*k is even we may take (b_1,...,b_n) = (a_k,a_{k+1},a_{k-1},a_{k+2},...,a_2,a_{2k-1},a_1,a_{2k}); when n = 2*k-1 is odd we may take (b_1,...,b_n) = (a_k,a_{k-1},a_{k+1},a_{k-2},a_{k+2},..., a_2,a_{2k-2},a_1,a_{2k-1}).
%C A185645 On Sep 01 2013, Zhi-Wei Sun made the following conjecture: (i) For any n distinct real numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (not necessarily in ascending or descending order), there is a permutation b_1, ..., b_n of a_1, ..., a_n with b_1 = a_1 such that the n-1 distances |b_1-b_2|, |b_2-b_3|, ..., |b_{n-1}-b_n| are pairwise distinct.
%C A185645   (ii) Let a_1, ..., a_n be n distinct elements of a finite additive abelian group G. Suppose that |G| is not divisible by n, or n is even and G is cyclic. Then there exists a permutation b_1, ..., b_n of a_1, ..., a_n with b_1 = a_1 such that the n-1 differences b_{i+1}-b_i (i = 1, ..., n-1) are pairwise distinct.
%C A185645 We believe that part (ii) of the new conjecture holds at least when G is cyclic, and it might also hold when the group G is not abelian.
%C A185645 Note that if g is a primitive root modulo an odd prime p, then for any j = 0,...,p-2 the permutation g^j, g^{j+1},...,g^{j+p-2} of the p-1 nonzero residues modulo p has adjacent differences g^{i+j+1}-g^{i+j} = g^{i+j}*(g-1) (i = 0, ..., p-3) which are pairwise distinct modulo p.

%e A185645 a(4) = 1 since (q_1,q_2,q_3,q_4) = (2,5,3,7) is the only suitable permutation.
%e A185645 a(5) = 3 since there are exactly three suitable permutations(q_1,q_2,q_3,q_4,q_5): (2,3,7,5,11), (2,5,7,3,11) and (2,7,3,5,11).
%e A185645 a(6) = 5 since there are exactly five suitable permutations (q_1,q_2,q_3,q_4,q_5,q_6): (2,5,3,11,7,13), (2,5,7,11,3,13), (2,7,5,11,3,13), (2,7,11,5,3,13), (2,11,5,7,3,13).
