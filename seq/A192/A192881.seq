%e A192881 Since 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6 + 1/20 = 1, we see that a(3) <= 5.  We know the maximum sum of 4 distinct unit fractions (1/3 or less) is 19/20, so this shows a(3)=5. An Egyptian fraction decomposition of 1 starting with 1/4 must have at least 8 terms; however, the expressions need not be unique, as all three of 1 = 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6 + 1/7 + 1/8 + 1/9 + 1/230 + 1/57960, 1 = 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6 + 1/7 + 1/8 + 1/9 + 1/231 + 1/27720 and 1 = 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6 + 1/9 + 1/10 + 1/15 + 1/18 + 1/20 achieve this bound. - _Teena Carroll_, _Haoqi Chen_ and _Javier Múgica_
