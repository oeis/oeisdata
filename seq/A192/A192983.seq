%N A192983 a(n) is the number of pairs (g, h) of elements of the symmetric group S_n such that g and h have conjugates that commute.
%C A192983 a(n) / n!^2 is the probability that two permutation in S_n, chosen independently and uniformly at random, have conjugates that commute.
%C A192983 Apparently n | a(n), and, for n>1, n*(n-1) | a(n). - _Alexander R. Povolotsky_, Sep 30 2011

%e A192983 For n = 3 the probability that two elements of S_3 have conjugates that commute is a(3)/3!^2 = 2/3. Proof: only the transpositions and three cycles fail to have conjugates that commute; the probability of choosing one permutation from each of these classes is 2*1/2*1/3 = 1/3.
