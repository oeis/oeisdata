%N A192822 4-Ramanujan primes; the interval (x/2,x] has at least n 3-Ramanujan primes for x >= a(n) but not for x = a(n)-1.
%C A192822 It is conjectured that primepi(a(n)) < 22*n for large n. - _T. D. Noe_, Aug 26 2011
%C A192822 The sequence is only conjectural without a proof of an upper bound on a(n) (like the bound A104272(n) < prime(3*n) proved by Laishram and used in computing Ramanujan primes). - _Jonathan Sondow_, Aug 27 2011
%C A192822 Subsequence of the 3-Ramanujan primes A192821, by the minimality of a(n). - _Jonathan Sondow_, Aug 21 2012
