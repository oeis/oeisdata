%N A192278 Numbers k whose product of their anti-divisors divides the product of their divisors.
%C A192278 All numbers are even and divisible by 6.
%e A192278 k=1884 has the anti-divisors 8, 24, 1256 whose product is 241152 and the divisors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 157, 314, 942, 1884, 628, 471 whose product is 44718310871557410816.  Their ratio 44718310871557410816 / 241152 = 185436201530808 is integral so 1884 is a term of the sequence.
