%N A192896 Prime factor addition sequence: For the term n, add all the prime factors of n to n. If n is a prime then add n to it. Start with n = 3
%C A192896 If n has repeated prime factors, then these are added as indicated by the exponents. For example, 18336 = 2^5 * 3 * 191, therefore we add 2 five times in our sum to obtain the next term of the sequence. - _Alonso del Arte_, Jul 12 2011

%e A192896 For n = 3, n is a prime number so the next term is 6.
%e A192896 For n = 6, n is not a prime factor, as n = 2*3, so the next term = 6+2+3 = 11.
