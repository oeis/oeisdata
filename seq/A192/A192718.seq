%N A192718 Elements of A192628 which are congruent to 7 (mod 8) (equivalently, 7 (mod 16)).
%C A192718 This is the subsequence/subset of A192628 which contains elements congruent to 7 modulo 8.  Equivalently, these elements are also congruent to 7 modulo 16.
%C A192718 By partitioning A192628 into congruence classes k modulo 8, it turns out that it contains only elements congruent to 0, 1, 3, and 7 modulo 8.  Further, the congruence classes 0, 1, and 3 modulo 8 are vanishing--having a density asymptotic to 0.
%C A192718 However, the 7 modulo 8 congruence classes appears to have nonzero density, conjectured 1/32.  A current upper bound on its density (thus the entire density of A192628) is 1/16.
