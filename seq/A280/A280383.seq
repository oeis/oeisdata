%N A280383 Numbers n such that n-1 has the same count of prime factors as n+1 when including multiplicity and also when not.
%C A280383 First differs from its subsequence A074997 at a(97) = 701 because A074997(97) = 722.

%F A280383 Sequence is A088070 INTERSECT A280382.
%e A280383 The number 19 is a term because 18 = 2*3^2 and 20 = 2^2*5 each have two distinct prime factors and each have three prime factors when counted with multiplicity.
