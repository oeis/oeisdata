%N A280153 Number of ways to write n as x^3 + 2*y^3 + z^2 + 4^k, where x is a positive integer and y,z,k are nonnegative integers.
%C A280153 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 1, and a(n) = 1 only for n = 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 17, 24, 36, 38, 52, 62, 115, 136, 185, 990.
%C A280153 (ii) Each positive integer n can be written as x^2 + 2*y^2 + z^3 + 8^k with x,y,z,k nonnegative integers.
%C A280153 (iii) Let a,b,c be positive integers with b <= c. Then any positive integer can be written as a*x^3 + b*y^2 + c*z^2 + 4^k with x,y,z,k nonnegative integers, if and only if (a,b,c) is among the following triples: (1,1,1), (1,1,2), (1,1,3), (1,1,5), (1,1,6), (1,2,3), (1,2,5), (2,1,1), (2,1,2), (2,1,3), (2,1,6), (4,1,2), (5,1,2), (8,1,2), (9,1,2).
%C A280153 We have verified that a(n) > 0 for all n = 2..10^6, and that part (ii) of the conjecture holds for all n = 1..10^6.
%C A280153 For any positive integer n, it is easy to see that at least one of n-1, n-8, n-64 is not of the form 4^k*(8m+7) with k and m nonnegative integers, thus, by the Gauss-Legendre theorem on sums of three squares, n = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8^k for some nonnegative integers x,y,z and k < 3.
%C A280153 See also A280356 for a similar conjecture involving powers of two.
