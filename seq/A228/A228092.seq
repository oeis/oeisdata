%N A228092 Lexicographically first sequence of nonprime terms (with no duplicates) that turns into a sequence of prime terms (with no duplicates) by applying the "comma-permutation" simultaneously at every comma. [The "comma-permutation" is explained in the Comments section.].
%C A228092 The "comma-permutation" swaps the last digit of a(n) and the first digit of a(n+1) for every n. For instance [2016,2017] becomes [2012,6017] and [2016,2017,2018] turns into [2012,6012,7018].
%C A228092 The sequence is always extended with the smallest integer not yet present that does not lead to a contradiction.
%C A228092 No term ends in "0" as this "0" would start a term of the prime sequence.

%e A228092 Under the "comma-permutation" the nine nonprime terms [1,21,12,32,33,91,14,72,111,15] become the primes [2,11,13,23,29,31,17,41,211].
