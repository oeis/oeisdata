%N A228626 Number of Hamiltonian cycles in the undirected simple graph G_n with vertices 1,...,n which has an edge connecting vertices i and j if and only if |i-j| is prime.
%C A228626 Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n > 4. In other words, for each n = 5,6,... there is a permutation i_1,...,i_n of 1,...,n such that |i_1-i_2|, |i_2-i_3|, ..., |i_{n-1}-i_n| and |i_n-i_1| are all prime.
%C A228626 Note that this conjecture is different from the prime circle problem in A051252 though they look similar.
%C A228626 On August 30 2013, Yong-Gao Chen (from Nanjing Normal University) confirmed the conjecture for n > 12 as follows: If n = 2*k then G_n contains a Hamiltonian cycle (1,3,5,2,7,9,...,2k-5,2k-3,2k,2k-2,2k-4,2k-1,2k-6,2k-8,...,6,4);
%C A228626 if n = 2*k + 1 then G_n contains a Hamiltonian cycle
%C A228626   (1,3,5,2,7,9,...,2k-5,2k,2k-3,2k-1,2k+1,2k-2,2k-4,...,6,4).
%C A228626 We have got Chen's approval to include his proof here.

%e A228626 a(5) = 1 since G_5 contains the unique Hamiltonian cycle (1,4,2,5,3).
%e A228626 a(6) = 2 since G_6 contains exactly two Hamiltonian cycles: (1,3,5,2,4,6) and (1,4,2,5,3,6).
%e A228626 a(7) = 4 since G_7 contains exactly four Hamiltonian cycles: (1,3,5,2,7,4,6), (1,3,5,7,2,4,6), (1,4,2,7,5,3,6) and (1,4,7,2,5,3,6).
