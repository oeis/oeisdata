%N A228853 Nodes of tree generated as follows: (1,2) is an edge, and if (x,y) is an edge, then (y,y+x) and (y,2y+x) are edges.
%C A228853 As a tree, infinitely many branches are essentially linearly recurrent sequences.  The extreme cases, (1,2) -> (2,3) -> (3,5) -> ... and (1,2) -> (2,5) -> (5,12) -> ..., contribute A000045 (Fibonacci numbers) and A000129 (Pell numbers) to A228853.
%C A228853 Suppose that (u,v) and (v,w) are consecutive edges.  The continued fraction of w/v is obtained from the continued fraction of v/u by prefixing 1 if w = v + u, or 2 if w = 2v + u. Consequently, if each edge is labeled with 1 or 2 in the obvious way, then the continued fraction of w/v is the sequence of 1s and 2s, in reverse order, from the node 2 to the node w, with 2 attached at the end. (See Example, Part 2.)
%C A228853 Is A228853 essentially A141832?  (If so, the answer to the question in Comments at A141832 is that A141832 is infinite.)
%C A228853 Yes; the initial node (1,2) adds a single 2 to the end of the fraction, and subsequent edges prepend 1's and 2's. - _Charlie Neder_, Oct 21 2018

%e A228853 Part 1: Taking the first generation of edges of the tree to be G(1) = {(1,2)}, the edge (1,2) grows G(2) = {(2,3), (2,5)}, which grows G(3) = {(3,5), (3,8), (5,7), (5,12)}, ... Expelling duplicate nodes and sorting leave {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, ...}.
%e A228853 Part 2: The branch 2, 3, 8, 11, 19, 30, 49, 128, 305 has edge-labels 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, so that 305/128 = [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2].
