%N A228881 Minimum number of spheres touching a wall of the container in the densest packing of n equal spheres into a cube.
%C A228881 Spheres that are not part of the rigid framework, "rattlers", are always assumed not to touch the walls of the container cube.
%C A228881 If optimal configurations can be obtained by taking away an arbitrary sphere from a configuration with a higher sphere count, a sphere touching the container wall is chosen.

%e A228881 The first configuration in which there is an inner sphere not touching the walls occurs for n = 9, with 8 spheres in the corners of the cube and one sphere in the center of the cube. Therefore a(9) = 8.
