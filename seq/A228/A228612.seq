%N A228612 Number of (possibly overlapping) occurrences of the subword given by the binary expansion of n in all binary words of length n.
%C A228612 a(2^n) = a(2^n-1) for n>0.

%F A228612 a(n) = Sum_{k>0} k*A233940(n,k).
%e A228612 a(3) = 4 because we have one subword 11 in each of 011, 110 and two overlapping occurrences of 11 in 111.
%e A228612 a(4) = 4 because we have one subword 100 in each of 0100, 1000, 1001, 1100 and no other occurrences in binary words of length 4.
%e A228612 a(5) = 12 because we have one subword 101 in each of 00101, 01010, 01011, 01101, 10100, 10110, 10111, 11010, 11011, 11101 and two overlapping occurrences of 101 in 10101.
