%N A228780 Power basis components of the algebraic numbers S2(n) in Q(2*cos(Pi/n)), where S2(n) is the square of the sum of the lengths of the distinct line segments (side and diagonals) in the regular n-gon.
%C A228780 The length of row n of this irregular array is the degree of the algebraic number rho(n):= 2*cos(Pi/n), given in A055034(n). See a Jul 19 2011 comment there.
%C A228780 The regular n-gon, inscribed in a circle of radius defining the length unit 1, has distinct line segments (chords) (V_0, V_j), j=1, ... , floor(n/2), with the n-gon vertices V_j, j=0, ... , n-1 distributed on the circle in the counterclockwise sense. The corresponding length ratios are denoted by L(n,j)/radius. The side length is s(n) = (V_0, V_1) = 2*sin(Pi/n), and for n >= 4 the first (the smallest) diagonal has length s(n)*rho(n), with rho(n) of degree delta(n) given above. s(2) = 2 is the ratio of the diameter of the circle. rho(2) = 0, but we use here rho(2)^0  = 1.
%C A228780 For n = 3: rho(3) = 1, s(3)^2 = 3. The algebraic number field Q(rho(n)) is the subject of the W. Lang link given below.
%C A228780 S2(n) := (sum(L(n,j)/radius, j=1, ... ,floor(n/2))^2 is seen below to be a number in the field Q(rho(n)) of degree delta(n), namely S2(n) = sum(a(n,k)*rho(n)^k, k=0..(delta(n)-1)). From the definition one has S2(n) = (s(n)*sum(S(j-1,rho(n)), j=1..floor(n/2)))^2, with the Chebyshev S-polynomials (see A049310). Due to s(n) = s(2*n)*rho(2*n), rho(2*n) = sqrt(2 + rho(n)) and an S-identity this becomes S2(n) = (s(2*n)*S(floor(n/2)-1, rho(2*n))*S(floor(n/2), rho(2*n)))^2. This can also be written as S2(n) = 4*(1 - T(2*floor(n/2), rho(2*n)/2))*(1 - T(2*(floor(n/2)+1), rho(2*n)/2))/(4-rho(2*n)^2), with Chebyshev's T-polynomials (see A053120). S2(n), written as a function of rho(n), has to be computed modulo the minimal polynomial C(n,rho(n)) of degree delta(n). These minimal polynomials are treated in A187360 (see the link to a Galois paper there, with its Table 2 and Section 3). The result is then the above given representation of S2(n) in the power basis of Q(rho(n)).
%C A228780 This computation was inspired by an email exchange with Seppo Mustonen. The author thanks him for sending the paper given as a link below. In this connection one should consider the even and odd n cases separately in order to find the square of the total length segments/radius in the regular n-gon, noticing that in the odd n case each distinct chord (side or diagonal) appears 2*(n/2) = n times, whereas in the even n case the longest diagonal of length 2 (in units of the radius) appears only n/2 times and the other chords appear n times.

%e A228780 n=5: S2(5) = (4-rho(5)^2)*(Sum_{j=1..2} S(j-1,rho(5)))^2 = 4 + 8*rho(5) + 3*rho(5)^2 - 2*rho(5)^3 - rho(5)^4, reduced with C(5,x) = x^2 - x - 1, with x = rho(5), using C(5,rho(5)) = 0, to eliminate all powers of rho(5) starting with power 2.
%e A228780 This leads to S2(5) = 3*1 + 4*rho(5). rho(5) = phi, the golden section.
