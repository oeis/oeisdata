%N A339866 Primes that are simultaneously the sums of 11, 13, and 15 consecutive primes.
%C A339866 Intersection of A127340, A127341, A161612.
%C A339866 The first case with 17 consecutive primes is a(219) = 8410721789. Are there more such terms?
%C A339866 a(10) = 205286087 is the sum of k consecutive primes not only for k = 11, 13, and 15, but also for k=1 (i.e., a(10) is a prime), k=9, and k=233. - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Apr 24 2021
%e A339866 Sum_{k=61746..61756} prime(k) = Sum_{k=52937..52949} prime(k) = Sum_{k=46425..46439} prime(k) = 8472193, so 8472193 is a term. - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Apr 24 2021
