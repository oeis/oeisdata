%N A339939 Coreful weird numbers: numbers k that are coreful abundant (A308053) but no subset of their aliquot coreful divisors sums to k.
%C A339939 First differs from A321146 at n = 24.
%C A339939 A coreful divisor d of a number k is a divisor with the same set of distinct prime factors as k, or rad(d) = rad(k), where rad(k) is the largest squarefree divisor of k (A007947).
%C A339939 From _Amiram Eldar_, Dec 01 2025: (Start)
%C A339939 A number k is a term if and only if k divided by its squarefree kernel is a weird number, i.e., A003557(k) is in A006037.
%C A339939 If k is a term and m is a squarefree number coprime to k, then k*m is also a term. The primitive terms in this sequence (A391142) are the powerful (A001694) terms. All the terms are of the form k*m where k is primitive and m is a squarefree number coprime to k.
%C A339939 The asymptotic density of this sequence is Sum_{n>=1} f(A391142(n)) = Sum_{n>=1} 1/A181797(A006037(n)) = 6.1509776...*10^(-5), where f(n) = (6/(Pi^2*n)) * Product_{prime p|n} (p/(p+1)). (End)

%e A339939 4900 is a term since the sum of its aliquot coreful divisors, {70, 140, 350, 490, 700, 980, 2450}, is 5180 > 4900, and no subset of these divisors sums to 4900.
