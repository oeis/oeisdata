%N A339062 Sorted list of prime numbers in the union of 7-tuples (a,b,c,d,e,f,g) satisfying a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + e^2 + f^2 + g^2 = a*b*c*d*e*f*g.
%C A339062 Prime numbers that appear in the integer solutions {X(1),X(2),...X(n)} of Markoff-Hurwitz equation X(1)^2 + ... + X(n)^2 = a*X(1)*...*X(n) for a=1 and n=7.
%C A339062 7-tuples that are solutions of the above equation consisting only of primes appear to be very rare. In this special case the number N=X(1)*...*X(7) is equal to the sum of the squares of its prime factors (with multiplicity).
%C A339062 _Giorgos Kalogeropoulos_ has found two numbers N having 123 and 163 digits respectively.
%C A339062 The factors of the first one are {2, 2, 2, 23, 1109123111, 57766182616657495290612267717977498812931942308391, 11788844704086155814066994795339207139099517865226893357415731}, so this 7-tuple is a solution and all these primes belong to the sequence. (See Rivera's link for the second 7-tuple).
