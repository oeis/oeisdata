%N A339328 Integers m such that A240471(m) > A115588(m).
%C A339328 Integers m such that integer part of the harmonic mean of divisors of m is greater than the number of distinct prime numbers necessary to represent m.
%C A339328 For all m not in this sequence this integer part is equal to the number of distinct prime numbers necessary to represent m.
%C A339328 This correlation between A240471 and A115588 contains some apparently random component.
%C A339328 If the integer part of the harmonic mean of divisors of m equals 1 we will find an 1 in A115588(m) too, for all m. If the integer part of the harmonic mean of divisors of m equals 2 we will find 2 in A115588(m) too, with probability of ~0.9877 for m in range 2-1000.
%C A339328 For m until 10000 the only exceptions are 16 and 27. If the integer part of the harmonic mean of divisors of m equals 3 we will find 3 in A115588(m) too, with probability of ~0.1983 for m in range 2-1000. For integer parts greater than 3 the probability gets fast smaller.
%C A339328 If m is a square of a prime it is not in this sequence.
%C A339328 Let m be a semiprime with two distinct prime factors p1 and p2. If m >= 3(1+p1+p2) then m is in this sequence. Example: 55 > 3(1+5+11). This can be generalized for k-almostprimes if all factors are distinct: If m(2^k) >= (1+k)sigma(m) then m is in this sequence. Example: 105*8 > 4*192.
%C A339328 Let p be a prime greater than 2. Let o be a natural number >0 without divisor p, then if m = o*p^p, m is in this sequence. This can be generalized for a set of distinct primes >2 {p_1,p_2,...,p_n} and any permutation of this set {p_a,p_b,...,p_z}, then if m = o*p_1^p_a*p_2^p_b*...*p_n^p_z, m is in this sequence. Example: 3960 = 55*2^3*3^2.
%C A339328 The sequence includes all numbers whose prime factorization contains at least one composite exponent (A322448).
