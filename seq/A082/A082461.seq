%N A082461 Non-palindromic numbers whose decimal expansion is a concatenation of the form a_1 a_2 a_3 ... a_{k-1} a_k a_k a_{k-1} ... a_2 a_1 (k >= 1) or a_1 a_2 a_3 ... a_{k-1} a_k a_{k-1} ... a_2 a_1 (k >= 2) for positive integers a_1, ..., a_k. For i>1, a_i may have leading zeros.
%C A082461 Of course any number m can be written as m = a_1, but this trivial construction is excluded.
%C A082461 A palindromic number of four digits has the form abba, where a is in {1, 2, ..., 9} and b is in {0, 1, 2, ..., 9}. There are 9*10 = 90 possibilities. For example, 1551 or 2002, but not 3753. However, 3753 = 3(75)3 and 4646 = (46)(46) are terms of the present sequence. The 4-digit numbers in the present sequence therefore have the form ABA, where A is in {1, 2, ..., 9} and B is in {00, 01, 02, 03, ..., 99} \ {00, 11, 22, 33, ..., 99}; or CC, where C is in {10, 11, 12, ..., 99} \ {11, 22, 33, ..., 99}. In the first case there are 9*(100-10) = 9*90 = 810 terms. In the second case, 90-9 = 81. Total: 810+81 = 891 4-digit non-palindromic terms.

%e A082461 For example, 1235656312 is a term because we can group it as (12)(3)(56)(56)(3)(12), i.e. ABCCBA.
