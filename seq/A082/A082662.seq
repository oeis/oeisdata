%N A082662 Numbers k such that the odd part of k is less than sqrt(2k).
%C A082662 Theorem: The following eight definitions are equivalent.
%C A082662 (P1) Numbers k such that the odd part of k (A000265(k)) is < sqrt(2k).
%C A082662   (P1) is the new definition, repeated here for convenience. Note that this is not the same as saying A000265(k) < A172471(k), since A172471(k) = floor(sqrt(2*k)).
%C A082662 (P2) Numbers k such that the odd divisors of k are < sqrt(2k).
%C A082662   (P2) and (P1) are obviously equivalent.
%C A082662 (P3) The numbers 1, S_0, S_1, S_2, ..., where
%C A082662   S_m = { 2^(m+1)*(2^m+i) : i = 0 .. 3*2^m - 1 }.
%C A082662 So S_0 = {2,4,6}, S_1 = {8,12,16,20,24,28}, S_2 = {32,40,48,...,120}, S_3 = {128,144,...,496}, ...
%C A082662   The proof that (P3) and (P1) are the same sequence is not difficult and will be added later. (P3) is equivalent to a formula stated without proof (it may have been only an empirical observation) in the original version of this entry.
%C A082662 (P4) Numbers k such that the odd part of k is <= A003056(k).
%C A082662   That is, the odd part of k is <= floor((sqrt(1+8*n)-1)/2). It is more difficult to show this is equivalent to (P1), but it is true.
%C A082662 (P5) Numbers k such that the odd divisors of k are <= A003056(k).
%C A082662   (P5) and (P4) are obviously equivalent.
%C A082662 (P6) Numbers k such that A001227(k) = A082647(k).
%C A082662   (P6) was the original definition. In words, it says that the number of odd divisors of k is equal to the number of ways to write k as a sum of an odd number of consecutive positive integers, or equivalently as a sum of d consecutive positive integers for some d dividing k.  To show that (P6) is equivalent to (P1) one makes use of the Hirschhorn-Hirschhorn article.
%C A082662 (P7) Numbers k such that the odd part of k is <= the sum of divisors of the even part.
%C A082662   (P7) was contributed by _Jaycob Coleman_, Jun 21 2014. To show (P7) is equivalent to (P1), write k as 2^m*s where s is odd.  Equality holds if and only if k is an even perfect number.
%C A082662 (P8) Numbers k such that A000265(k) <= A000203(A006519(k)) or also such that A000265(k) <= A038712(k).
%C A082662   (P8) was contributed by _Michel Marcus_, Aug 14 2014. It is a restatement of (P7).
%C A082662 (End of theorem)
%C A082662 A further equivalent property, (P9), follows at once from (P4). This was conjectured by  _Omar E. Pol_, Apr 18 2017
%C A082662 (P9) These are the numbers k such that the sequence of successive widths in the symmetric representation of sigma(k) is unimodal.
%C A082662 Yet another equivalent property:
%C A082662 (P10) Numbers k >= 1 such if k = i + (i+1) + (i+2) + ... + (i+j-1) for some i >= 1 and j >= 1 then j is odd [Caballero, 2019]. - _Michel Marcus_, Jan 16 2020
