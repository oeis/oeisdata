%N A082981 Start with the sequence S(0)={1,1} and for k>0 define S(k) to be I(S(k-1)) where I denotes the operation of inserting, for i=1,2,3..., the term a(i)+a(i+1) between any two terms for which 4a(i+1)<=5a(i). The listed terms are the initial terms of the limit of this process as k goes to infinity.
