%N A082239 Infinite table filled by antidiagonals with smallest numbers such that every partial concatenation of a row or a column gives a prime.
%C A082239 Table is symmetric with respect to its main diagonal.
%C A082239 Like magic squares one can define primagic squares as a symmetric square table of numbers in which every partial concatenation of a row or column gives only primes. 2, 2 3 2 3 3 3 1, 3 1 1 3 1 1, ... are primagic squares of order 1 2 and 3 respectively occurring in the above array. An absolute primagic square can be defined as the one whose members are all prime. A strictly primagic square can be defined as the one in which both the diagonals also yield primes. The primagic square of order 3 above is an example.
