%N A082275 Palindromes k such that k + 11 is also a palindrome.
%C A082275 A pattern is visible.
%C A082275 From _David A. Corneth_, Jul 28 2025: (Start)
%C A082275 Terms can be constructed as follows: The first and last digit are 1 through 8 (and equal). Any digits in between are 9.
%C A082275 Proof: By adding 11 to a palindrome its last digit changes and its 10s digit changes. Therefore the first digit must change. This can only happen if there is carry to the through the first digit and only happens when the digits (if any) between the first and last digit are all 9. If the last digit of k is 9 then the last digit of k+11 is 0 but no palindrome exists ending in 0. There are no other palindromes with this property since we must have c*10^m - 10 <= k < c*10^m where 2 <= c <= 9. (End)
%e A082275 595 + 11 = 606 is also a palindrome.

It will generate an additional 8 terms for each increase in {k,0,5}. - _Harvey P. Dale_, Jan 29 2023 *) (* For a proof of this pattern, see _David A. Corneth_, Jul 28 2025 *)
