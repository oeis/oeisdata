%N A082945 Numbers n which in decimal have the form imj, where m is the middle digit, with property that j is the reversal of i, and i = m*j.
%C A082945 The number i should not end in 0, and m should not equal 0.
%C A082945 Suggested by _Amarnath Murthy_.
%C A082945 Either i and j are identical palindromes and m is 1, or i is in A031877, j is the corresponding term in A008919, and m is either 4 or 9. - _Charlie Neder_, Mar 08 2019
