%N A082691 a(1)=1, a(2)=2, then if the first 3*2^k-1 terms are a(1), a(2), ..., a(3*2^k - 1), the first 3*2^(k+1)-1 terms are a(1), a(2), ..., a(3*2^k - 1), a(1), a(2), ..., a(3*2^k - 1), a(3*2^k-1) + 1.
%C A082691 Consider the subsequence b(k) such that a(b(k))=1. Then 3k - b(k) = A063787(k+1) and b(k) = 1 + A004134(k-1).
%C A082691 From _Sam Alexander_, Nov 27 2010: (Start)
%C A082691 A naive way to try and guess whether a sequence is periodic, based on its first k terms (n1, ..., nk), is to look at all sequences which have period less than k, and guess "periodic" if any of them extend (n1, ..., nk), "nonperiodic" otherwise.
%C A082691 a(1)=1, a(2)=2. Suppose a(1), ..., a(n) have been defined, n > 1.
%C A082691 1. If the above guessing method guesses that (a(1), ..., a(n)) is an initial segment of a periodic sequence, then let a(n+1) be the least nonzero number not appearing in (a(1), ..., a(n)).
%C A082691 2. Otherwise, let (a(n+1), ..., a(2n)) be a copy of (a(1), ..., a(n)).
%C A082691 This sequence thwarts the guessing attempt, tricking the guesser into changing his mind infinitely many times as n->infinity. (End)
%C A082691 As n increases, the average value of the first n terms approaches 7/3 = 2.333... - _Maxim Skorohodov_, Dec 15 2022

%e A082691 To construct the sequence: start with (1, 2); concatenating those 2 terms gives (1,2,1,2). Appending 3 gives the first 5 terms: (1,2,1,2,3). Concatenating those 5 terms gives (1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3). Appending 4 gives the first 11 terms: (1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,4), etc.
