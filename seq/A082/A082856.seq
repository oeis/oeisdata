%N A082856 Recursive binary interleaving code for rooted plane binary trees, as ordered by A014486.
%C A082856 This encoding has a property that the greatest common subtree i.e. the intersect (or the least common supertree, the union) of any two trees can be obtained by simply computing the binary-AND (A004198) (or respectively: binary-OR, A003986) of the corresponding codes. See A082858-A082860.

%e A082856 The empty tree . has code 0, the tree of two edges (and leaves) \/ has code 1 and in general tree's code is obtained by interleaving into odd and even bits (above bit-0, which is always 1 for nonempty trees) the codes for the left and right hand side subtrees of the tree.
