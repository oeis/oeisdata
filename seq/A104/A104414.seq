%N A104414 Number of prime factors, with multiplicity, of the heptanacci numbers A066178.
%C A104414 Prime heptanacci numbers: a(2) = 2, a(8) = 127, a(16) = 31489, ... Semiprime heptanacci numbers: a(4) = 4 = 2^2, a(9) = 253 = 11 * 23, a(18) = 124946 = 2 * 62473, a(24) = 7805695 = 5 * 1561139.
%F A104414 a(n) = A001222(A066178(n)). a(n) = bigomega(A066178(n)).
%e A104414 a(0)=a(1)=0 because the first two nonzero heptanacci numbers are both 1, which has zero prime divisors.
%e A104414 a(2)=1 because the 3rd nonzero heptanacci number is 2, a prime, with only one prime divisor.
%e A104414 a(3)=2 because the 4th nonzero pentanacci number is 4 = 2^2 which has (with multiplicity) 2 prime divisors (which happen to be equal).
%e A104414 a(4)=3 because the 5th nonzero heptanacci number is 8 = 2^3.
%e A104414 a(12)= 7 because A066178(12) = 2000 = 2^4 * 5^3 which has seven prime factors (four of the 2, three of them 5).
