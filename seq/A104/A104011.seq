%N A104011 Number of prime factors (with multiplicity) of centered dodecahedral numbers (A005904).
%C A104011 When a(n) = 2, n is an element of A104012: indices of centered dodecahedral numbers (A005904) which are semiprimes.
%D A104011 B. K. Teo and N. J. A. Sloane, Magic numbers in polygonal and polyhedral clusters, Inorgan. Chem. 24 (1985), 4545-4558.
%F A104011 a(n) = A001222(A005904(n)). a(n) = Bigomega((2*n+1)*(5*n^2 + 5*n + 1)).
%e A104011 a(9) = 3 because A005904(9) = 8569 = 11 * 19 * 41, which has 3 prime factors (which happen to have the same number of digits).
%e A104011 a(18) = 3 because A005904(18) = 63307 = 29 * 37 * 59.
%e A104011 a(96) = 3 because A005904(96) = 8986273 = 101 * 193 * 461.
%e A104011 a(126) = 5 because A005904(126) = 20242783 = 11 * 23 * 29 * 31 * 89, which has 5 prime factors (which happen to have the same number of digits).
