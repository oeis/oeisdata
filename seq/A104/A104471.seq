%N A104471 Triangle of degree numbers for certain polynomials.
%C A104471 This is the rectangular array ay(N,m):=sum(j*floor(N/j),j=1..m), m>=1, N>=1, written as a triangle a(n,m):=ay(n-m+1,m).
%C A104471 If A(j,x) is a polynomial of exact degree N(j):=floor(N/j), with some N>=1 and j=1,2,..., then F(m,x):=product(A(j,x^j),j=1..m) has degree A(N,m). This product appears in Fine's identity (on the lhs) if a finite product with m factors is taken. See the Riordan reference p. 182 eq.(20).
%C A104471 This choice of the degree N(j) guarantees that in F(m,x) all coefficients of x^n for n=0,...,N are correctly given. Due to Fine's identity (on the rhs) the coefficient of x^n of F(m,x) is given by the sum over all partitions of n with number of parts m of the product(a(j,k(j)),j=1..m), where a(j,p) is [x^p]A(j,x) and k(j)>=0 is the exponent of j in the considered partition of n into m parts. If n<m then k(j)=0 for all j=n+1,..,m.
