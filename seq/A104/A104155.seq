%N A104155 The 64 codons of the genetic code, giving the value 1 to thymine (T), 3 to adenine (A), 2 to cytosine (C) and 4 to guanine (G).
%C A104155 The genetic code is universal, governing the synthesis of the proteins of all living species on Earth (including bacteria and viruses).
%C A104155 The information giving the order of the amino acids which are to be linked to each other to constitute the proteins is materially stored "in", "through" the DNA, "by" its succession of nucleotides materializing its two strands.
%C A104155 There are four nucleotides named Thymine (T), Adenine (A), Cytosine (C) and Guanine (G), which form one chain (e.g., ATGGAATTCTCGCT...), named the "template".
%C A104155 The second chain, named the coding strand, is complementary and its synthesis "on" the template is ruled by this chemical correspondence: A->T and T->A (by means of two hydrogen bonds); G->C and C-> (three H-bonds). The two strands so paired constitute the DNA, which is stable.
%C A104155 When a gene (a chunk of the DNA) is "activated" to govern the synthesis of "its" protein, a special coding strand, the "messenger RNA" (which is the real stuff governing the synthesis of the proteins) is copied on the template and goes in the cytoplasm where the ribosomes enter in action... The mRNA carries the same information as the coding strand, but in a slightly different form (a chemical difference in the chain and Uridin (U) replacing Thymine).
%C A104155 The unity of information carried by either the coding strand and the mRNA is materialized by the linear succession of groups of three nucleotides ("triples" of nucleotides), named also "codons" (e.g., ATG-GAA-TTC-TCG-...).
%C A104155 The four objects T, A, C and G taken three by three with repetitions yield 64 possible combinations which, giving the value 1 to T, 3 to A, 2 to C and 4 to G, are the terms of this sequence.
%C A104155 Since there is 64 codons coding for 20 amino acids, each amino acid is coded by one or many codons.
%C A104155 The correspondence term to term between codons of this sequence and amino acids is:
