%N A104276 Number of partitions of n in which both even and odd squares occur with multiplicity 1. There is no restriction on the parts which are twice even squares.
%F A104276 G.f.: Product_{k>0} ((1+x^(2k-1)^2)/(1-x^(2k)^2) = Product_{k>0} ((1+x^(2k-1)^2)*(1+x^(2k)^2)))/(1-x^2(2k)^2).
%e A104276 E.g. a(30) = 3 because we can write 30 as 25+4+1 = 16+9+4+1 = 8+8+9+4+1.
%p A104276 S := series(product((1+x^((2*k-1)^2))/(1-x^((2*k)^2)), k=1..100), x=0, 100):
