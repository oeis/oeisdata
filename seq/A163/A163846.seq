%N A163846 Starting from a(1)=5, a(n+1) is the smallest prime > a(n) such that 2*a(n)-a(n+1) is also prime.
%C A163846 This is: select the smallest prime a(n+1) = a(n)+d such that at a(n)-d is another prime at the same distance to but at the opposite side of a(n).
%C A163846 From _Zhi-Wei Sun_, Feb 25 2013: (Start)
%C A163846 By induction, a(n)==2 (mod 3) for all n>2.
%C A163846 For a prime p>3 define g(p) as the least prime q>p such that 2p-q is also prime. Construct a simple (undirected) graph G as follows: The vertex set is the set of all primes greater than 3, and there is an edge connecting the vertices p and q>p if and only if g(p)=q.
%C A163846 Conjecture: The graph G constructed above consists of exactly two trees: one containing 7 and all odd primes congruent to 2 modulo 3, and another one containing all primes congruent to 1 modulo 3 except 7. (End)

%e A163846 The first candidate for a(2) is the prime 5+2=7, which is selected since 5-2=3 is also prime.
%e A163846 The first candidate for a(3) is the prime 7+4=11, which is selected since 7-4=3 is also prime.
%e A163846 The first candidate for a(4) is the prime 11+2=13, which is not selected since 11-2=9 is composite.
%e A163846 The second candidate for a(4) is the prime 11+4=17, which is selected since 11-4=7 is prime.
