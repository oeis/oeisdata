%N A222866 Triangle T(n,k) of weakly graded (3+1)-free partially ordered sets (posets) on n labeled vertices with height k.
%C A222866 Here "weakly graded" means that there is a rank function rk from the vertices to the integers such that whenever x covers y we have rk(x) = rk(y) + 1.  Alternate terminology includes "graded" and "ranked."  A poset is said to be (3+1)-free if it does not contain four elements a, b, c, d such that a < b < c and d is incomparable to the other three.
