%N A222624 Sequence of dimensions of a regular simplex with unit edge that has at least one inter-hypersphere with a rational radius (including the radii of the in-hypersphere and circum-hypersphere).
%C A222624 The radius of the inter-hypersphere of a regular simplex of dimension k with unit edge is given by r=Sqrt((k-j)/(2*(k+1)*(j+1))) where 0<=j<k and j is the dimension of the hypersurface that the inter-hypersphere is tangent to. j=0 gives the radius of the circum-hypersphere and j=k-1 gives the radius of the in-hypersphere. The sequence identifies those dimensions k for which at least one inter-hypersphere has a rational radius.

%F A222624 a(n)=k is the n-th occurrence for which k=sqrt((k-j)/(2*(k+1)*(j+1))) is rational for at least one value of j in the range 0<=j<k.
%e A222624 a(3)=8 because it is the 3rd value of k with k=8 that has an inter-hypersphere of rational radius. In fact in dimension 8 the regular simplex with unit edge has 4 inter-hyperspheres of rational radius. They are 2/3 at j=0 (circum-hypersphere), 1/3 at j=2, 1/6 at j=5 and 1/12 at j=7 (in-hypersphere).
