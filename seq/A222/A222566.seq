%N A222566 a(1)=2; for n>0, a(n+1) is the least prime p>a(n) such that 2*(a(n)+1)-p is prime.
%C A222566 For a prime p define g(p) as the least prime q>p such that 2*(p+1)-q is prime. Construct a simple (undirected) graph G as follows: The vertex set of G is the set of all primes, and for the vertices p and q>p there is an edge connecting p and q if and only if g(p)=q. Clearly G contains no cycle.
%C A222566 Conjecture: The graph G constructed above is connected and hence it is a tree!
