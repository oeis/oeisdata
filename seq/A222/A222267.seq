%N A222267 The number of distinct lines defined by an n X n X n grid of points.
%C A222267 Given a cubic n X n X n grid of points, a(n) is the number of distinct lines produced by constructing a line through every pair of points.
%C A222267 Define the grid as consisting of the set of n^3 distinct points whose x, y and z coordinates are all integers in [0..n-1]. Assign to each grid point a distinct index j = x + n*y + n^2*z. For each pair of grid points P_A and P_B (where P_A is the one with the lower index j), let L be the line that passes through both grid points, and let S be the segment of that line from P_A to P_B. Examine each of the C(n^3,2) pairs of distinct grid points P_A and P_B; a(n) is the number of those pairs for which S does not pass through any other grid points between P_A and P_B, nor does L pass through any other grid points beyond the P_A end of S. - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Sep 21 2013
%C A222267 Conjecture: a(n) is approximately 0.3639537*n^6, with a relative error of about 10^-5 when n is near 200. - _Clive Tooth_, Mar 03 2016

%e A222267 Each of the 28 pairs of points on a 2 X 2 X 2 grid of points defines a distinct line, so a(2) = 28.
%e A222267 Of the 351 pairs of points on a 3 X 3 X 3 grid, there are only 253 distinct lines, so a(3) = 253.
