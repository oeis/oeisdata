%N A222864 Triangle T(n,k) of strongly graded (3+1)-free partially ordered sets (posets) on n labeled vertices with height k.
%C A222864 Here "strongly graded" means that every maximal chain has the same length. Alternate terminology includes "graded" (e.g., in Stanley 2011) and "tiered" (as in A006860). A poset is said to be (3+1)-free if it does not contain four elements a, b, c, d such that a < b < c and d is incomparable to the other three.

%F A222864 G.f. is given in the Lewis-Zhang paper.
%e A222864 For n = 3, there is 1 strongly graded poset of height 1 (the antichain), 6 strongly graded posets of height 2, and 6 strongly graded posets of height 3 (the chains), and all of these are (3+1)-free. Thus, the third row of the triangle is 1, 6, 6.
