%N A222620 Palindromic time display in hours, minutes, seconds on a six spaced 24-hour digital clock.
%C A222620 Leading zeros are ignored, so the term a(3) = 2, for example, corresponds to the display 00:00:02. Sequence has 699 entries. Greatest leap occurs between the successive terms a(675) = 155551 and a(676) = 200002; that is, between 15h55m51s and 20h00m02s.
