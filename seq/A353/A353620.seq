%N A353620 Side b of primitive integer-sided triangles (a, b, c) whose angle B = 3*C.
%C A353620 The triples (a, b, c) are displayed in increasing order of side b, and if sides b coincide then in increasing order of side c.
%C A353620 In the case B = 3*C, the corresponding metric relation between sides is c*a^2 = (b-c)^2 * (b+c).
%C A353620 Equivalently, length of side opposite to the angle that is the triple of another one, for primitive integer-sided triangles.
%C A353620 Note that side b is never the smallest side of the triangle.

%F A353620 a(n) = A353618(n, 2).
%e A353620 According to inequalities between a, b, c, there exist 3 types of such triangles:
%e A353620 a < c < b with the largest side b = 10 of the first triple (3, 10, 8).
%e A353620 c < a < b with the largest side b = 48 of the 2nd triple (35, 48, 27).
%e A353620 c < b < a with the middle side b = 510 of the 8th triple (539, 510, 216), the first of this type.
%e A353620 The first side b for which there exist two distinct triangles with B = 3*C is for a(11) = a(12) = 840, and these sides b belong respectively to triples (923, 840, 343) and (533, 840, 512).
