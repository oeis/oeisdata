%N A353447 a(n) is the number of tetrapods standing on the four edges of an n X n grid, so that no two feet are the same distance apart and no foot is on a corner. Tetrapods with congruent footprints are counted only once.
%C A353447 If we name the tetrapod's footprints "mini-frame", we can say that mini-frames span their grid, i.e., there is no smaller grid for them. Every corner-less set of points with distinct distances in a smallest possible n X n grid contains at least one mini-frame.
