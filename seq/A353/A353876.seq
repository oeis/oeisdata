%N A353876 Irregular table read by rows: for each internal vertex of a regular n-gon with all diagonals drawn remove all the edges connected directly to the vertex and then count the number of sides in the polygon that surrounds it; row n gives the number of resulting k-sided polygons, for k>=4, for all internal vertices.
%C A353876 Numerous patterns are found in the values of the k-gons for different n. For example for n = 4*m + 2, with m>=1, there is one maximum sided k-gon with 2*n edges. For n = 4*m, with m>=3, there is one maximum sided k-gon with n edges. For odd n, where n>=11, there is n maximum sided k-gons with n+2 edges.
%C A353876 The 8-gon appears to be unique in that there is 9 maximum sided k-gons, k=8, which is not 1 or a multiple of 8.
%C A353876 Only a limit number of even-n n-gons have vertex-surrounding polygons with 4 edges, the minimum possible value. See A353991.

%e A353876 The 7-gon has seven internal vertices surrounded by polygons with 5 edges, fourteen internal vertices surrounded by polygons with 7 edges, seven internal vertices surrounded by polygons with 9 edges, and seven internal vertices surrounded by polygons with 10 edges, so row 7 is [0, 7, 0, 14, 0, 7, 7].
