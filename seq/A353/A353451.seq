%N A353451 T(n,m) is the number of non-congruent quadrilaterals with integer vertex coordinates (x1,1), (n,y2), (x3,m), (1,y4), 1 < x1, x3 < n, 1 < y2, y4 < m, m <= n, such that the 6 distances between the 4 vertices are distinct and (x3-x1)*(y4-y2) = 0, where T(n,m) is a triangle read by rows.
%C A353451 Property "(x3-x1)*(y4-y2) = 0" holds iff one of the diagonals (spokes) of the quadrilateral is parallel to the x-axis or to the y-axis, i.e. not tilted (see example). The framed quadrilateral may be classified as "static" iff (x3-x1)*(y4-y2) = 0.
%C A353451 All quadrilaterals of A353532 are classified according to the sign of the product (x3-x1)*(y4-y2) as "all" = "unisense" (> 0) + "contrasense" (< 0) + "static" (= 0). The distinction is invariant under symmetry.

%e A353451 T(5,4) = 2 since these are the only static configurations of A353532(5,4). Spoke AC is not tilted, but parallel to the y-axis. First example: spoke DB is not tilted, but parallel to the x-axis. Second example: spoke DB is not parallel to the x-axis, but tilted to the left. We have (x3-x1)*(y4-y2) = 0 in both cases, so these framed quadrilaterals have the "static" property.
