%N A057980 Let n be a positive integer, n>3. Define a tournament on the vertex set {2,3,..,n} by: for i < j, i is adjacent to j if i divides j, else j is adjacent to i. If T(n) denotes its adjacency matrix, then the above sequence is det(T(n))for n=4,5,6....42.
%C A057980 MATLAB program was used to generate the tournament matrices T(n) and evaluate determinants. Obviously det(T(n))=0 if n is prime.
