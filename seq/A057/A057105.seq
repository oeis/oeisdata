%N A057105 Triangle of numbers (when unsigned) related to congruum problem: T(n,k)=k^2+2nk-n^2 with n>k>0 and starting at T(2,1)=1.
%C A057105 Signed values are only relevant for the explicit formula.
%C A057105 Refers to A057102, which had an incorrect description and has been replaced by A256418. As a result the present sequence should be re-checked. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Apr 06 2015

%F A057105 Unsigned: a(n) =sqrt(A055096(n)^2-A057103(n)) =sqrt(A056203(n)^2-2*A057103(n)).
%e A057105 a(1)=T(2,1)=1^2+2*2*1-2^2=1
%Y A057105 Cf. A057102. The congruum problem is about finding solutions for h (A057103) where there are integers x (A055096), y (A057105 unsigned) and z (A056203) such that h=x^2-y^2=z^2-x^2.
