%N A057782 Building block is trapezoid formed from 3 equilateral triangles; sequence gives number of pieces (polytraps) that can be formed from n such trapezoids.
%C A057782 Also known as "Polytriamonds" because the building block is the unique triamond (composite of three equilateral triangles joined edge-to-edge). - _Aaron N. Siegel_, May 23 2022
