%N A057899 Smallest positive integer such that n=a(n)^k-k with k a positive integer.
%C A057899 It may be that positive integers can be written as n=m^k-k (with m and k > 1) in at most one way [checked up to 10000] as well as with k=1 and m=n+1.
%F A057899 a(n) = (n+A057898(n))^(1/A057898(n)).
%e A057899 a(5)=2 since 5=2^3-3
