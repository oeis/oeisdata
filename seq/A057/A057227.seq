%N A057227 Smallest member of smallest set S(n) of positive integers containing n which satisfies "k is in S, iff 2k-1 is in S, iff 4k is in S".
%C A057227 Ratio of number of times 2 appears to number of times 1 appears tends towards (1+sqrt(5))/2. Ratio of number of times 2 appears to number of times 4m+2 appears tends towards ((1+sqrt(5))/2)^log_2(2m+1).

%e A057227 a(23)=2 since if 23 is in S(23) then so are 12, 3 and 2; however 1 need not be and so the smallest member of S(23) is 2.
%Y A057227 All values of a(n) are 1 or of form 4m+2, i.e., A016825. a(n)=1 iff n is in A048297.
