%N A057751 Irreducible trinomials of prime degree for some k: x^p + x^k + 1 is irreducible over GF(2) for at least one k, p>k>0.
%e A057751 The prime 79 is included because x^79 + x^9 + 1 is irreducible over GF(2). Only the primes 2 and 3 are irreducible for all ks between 0 and p. So far about one-half of all trinomials of a prime power are irreducible over GF(2) for at least one k between 0 and p.
