%N A057784 Number of polypons with n cells.
%C A057784 A polypon is a polyform made up of 30-30-120 triangles from the [3.12^2] Laves tiling, joined along their edges. Because that tiling contains hexagons formed as a union of six triangles, with the division of the hexagon having less symmetry than the hexagon on its own, some polypons can be divided into their constituent triangles in more than one way, and whether the division is significant affects the values of a(n) when n >= 18 is a multiple of 6. For the present sequence, the division into triangles is considered significant. - _Joseph Myers_, Oct 02 2011
