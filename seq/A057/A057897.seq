%N A057897 Numbers which can be written as m^k-k, with m, k > 1.
%C A057897 It may be that positive integers can be written as m^k-k (with m and k > 1) in at most one way [checked up to 10000].
%C A057897 All numbers < 10^16 of this form have a unique representation. The uniqueness question leads to a Pillai-like exponential Diophantine equation a^x-b^y = x-y for x > y > 1 and b > a > 1, which appears to have no solutions. - _T. D. Noe_, Oct 06 2004
