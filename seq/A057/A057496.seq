%N A057496 Numbers n such that x^n + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 is irreducible over GF(2).
%C A057496 If x^n + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 is irreducible, then so is its "twin" x^n + x^3 + 1. - Gove Effinger, Mar 11 2007
%C A057496 No term other than 3 can be a multiple of 3, since for m > 1, x^(3*m) + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 is divisible by x^2 + x + 1. - _Jianing Song_, May 11 2021
%F A057496 Using probabilistic arguments it appears that there should be about 6.5 terms in this sequence with any given number of decimal digits d. - Gove Effinger, Mar 11 2007
%Y A057496 Cf. A002475.
%Y A057496 Other than the term 3, subsequence of A057461.

%E A057496 a(36)-a(42) computed by Jonathan Webster, Feb 18 2010
%E A057496 Added entries a(1), a(2), a(3) since x^3 + x^2 + 1, x^3 + x + 1 and x^2 + x + 1 are irreducible over GF(2). Changed the offset for the entries computed by _Robert G. Wilson v_ and _Richard P. Brent_ to account for this. Added terms a(36) through a(42). - Jonathan Webster (jwebster(AT)bates.edu), Feb 18 2010
