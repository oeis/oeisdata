%N A059770 First solution of x^2 = 2 mod p for primes p such that a solution exists.
%C A059770 Solutions mod p are represented by integers from 0 to p-1. For p > 2: If x^2 = 2 has a solution mod p, then it has exactly two solutions and their sum is p; i is a solution mod p of x^2 = 2 iff p-i is a solution mod p of x^2 = 2. No integer occurs more than once in this sequence. Moreover, no integer (except 0) occurs both in this sequence and in sequence A059771 of the second solutions (Cf. A059772).

%F A059770 a(n) = first (least) solution of x^2 = 2 mod p, where p is the n-th prime such that x^2 = 2 mod p has a solution, i.e. p is the n-th term of A038873.
%e A059770 a(6) = 17, since 41 is the sixth term of A038873, 17 and 24 are the solutions mod 41 of x^2 = 2 and 17 is the smaller one.
