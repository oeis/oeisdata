%N A059044 Initial primes of sets of 5 consecutive primes in arithmetic progression.
%C A059044 Each set has a constant difference of 30, for all of the terms listed so far.
%C A059044 It is conjectured that there exist arbitrarily long sequences of consecutive primes in arithmetic progression. As of December 2000, the record is 10 primes.
%C A059044 The first CPAP-5 with common difference 60 starts at 6182296037 ~ 6e9, cf. A210727. This sequence consists of first members of pairs of consecutive primes in A054800 (see also formula): a(1..6) = A054800({1555, 4555, 6123, 7695, 8306, 8371}). Conversely, pairs of consecutive primes in this sequence yield a term of A058362, i.e., they start a sequence of 6 consecutive primes in arithmetic progression (CPAP-6): e.g., the nearby values a(12) = 121174811, a(13) = 121174841 = a(12) + 30 indicate such a term, whence A006560(6) = A058362(1) = a(12). The first CPAP-6 with common difference 60 starts at 293826343073 ~ 3e11, cf. A210727. Longer CPAP's must have common difference >= 210. - _M. F. Hasler_, Oct 26 2018
%C A059044 About 500 initial terms of this sequence are the same as for the sequence "First of 5 consecutive primes separated by gaps of 30". The first 10^4 terms of A052243 give 281 terms of this sequence (up to ~ 3.34e9) with the same formula as the one using A054800, but as the above comment says, this will miss terms beyond twice that range. - _M.
