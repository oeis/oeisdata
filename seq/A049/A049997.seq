%N A049997 Numbers of the form Fibonacci(i)*Fibonacci(j).
%C A049997 It follows from Atanassov et al. that a(n) << sqrt(phi)^n, which matches the trivial a(n) >> sqrt(phi)^n up to a constant factor. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Feb 06 2013
%C A049997 Conjecture: Fibonacci(m)*Fibonacci(n) with 2 < m < n is a perfect power only for (m,n) = (3,6). This has been verified for 2 < m < n <= 900. - _Zhi-Wei Sun_, Jan 02 2025

%e A049997 25 is in the sequence since it is the product of two, not necessarily distinct, Fibonacci numbers, 5 and 5.
%e A049997 26 is in the sequence since it is the product of two Fibonacci numbers, 2 and 13.
%e A049997 27 is not in the sequence because there is no way whatsoever to represent it as the product of exactly two Fibonacci numbers.
