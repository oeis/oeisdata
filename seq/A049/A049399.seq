%N A049399 A generalized difference set on the set of all integers (lambda = 2).
%C A049399 In the set of all positive differences of the sequence each integer appears exactly twice, i.e., lambda = 2.
%C A049399 One could try to greedily build such a difference set as follows: b(1) = 1, b(n+1) = b(n)+j with j the smallest difference yet to appear twice. This would begin with {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 17, 23, 31, 39, 49} and fail; the smallest difference yet to appear twice is then 12 = 17-5, but 49+12 = 61 and 61-39 = 22 = 23-1 = 39-17. - _Danny Rorabaugh_, Sep 27 2015

%F A049399 Let N_1={1, 2}. Given N_i, let N_{i+1} = N_i union {2k+2, 2k+2+j} where k = max element of N_i and j = smallest number of form x-y for at most one pair x, y in N_i, x>y. Union of all N_i gives sequence. - _Danny Rorabaugh_ (mirroring formula in A024431), Sep 27 2015
