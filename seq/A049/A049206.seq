%N A049206 Maximum mean distance between cards during perfect faro shuffles, with cut, to return to original order in A024222.
%F A049206 Take difference between successive cards after each shuffle. Compute mean (if necessary, round to nearest integer). Retain until replaced by a higher mean in a succeeding shuffle.

%e A049206 Consider n=6. There are 4 shuffles to return to original order in a 6-card deck. The maximum mean distance between cards during these 4 shuffles and cuts, s1-s4, is 3, computed as follows: s1, 415263, cut, 263415; s2, 421653, cut 653421; s3, 462513, cut 513462; s4, 456123, cut, 123456. Mean distances: s1 15/5=3, maximum; s2 7/5=1.4; s3 13/5=2.6; s4 5/5; mean cumulative distance: 40/20=2.
