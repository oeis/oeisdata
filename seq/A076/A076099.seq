%N A076099 Triangle read by rows in which the n-th row contains n numbers not occurring in the previous rows whose product is an n-th power. The first (n-1) numbers of the n-th row are the smallest number not occurring earlier and the n-th term is chosen to satisfy the requirement.
%C A076099 Another rearrangement of the natural numbers in which the product of next n numbers is an n-th power.
%C A076099 The first n-1 elements of the n-th group are the smallest n-1 numbers that haven't already appeared, say u1, u2, ..., u_(n-1) and let u_n be the unknown final element of the n-th group. Let u1*u2*u3*...*u_(n-1) = (p1^e1)(p2^e2)...(pr^er). Then u_n = product(i=1 to r) p_i^(ei + n*floor(ei/n) - n) ...unless this has already appeared in the sequence (probably this never happens). More simply, I conjecture that u_n = product(i=1 to r) p_i^(ei - n). - _Sam Alexander_, Dec 31 2003
