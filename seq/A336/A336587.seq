%N A336587 Smallest nonnegative integer containing the n-th letter of the Hebrew alphabet (in Hebrew using masculine numbers), or -1 if no such integer exists.
%C A336587 This sequence assumes the use of the short scale for naming large numbers. It is the same whether or not 10^9 is called "ביליון" (billion) or "מיליארד" (milliard).
%C A336587 Final forms of the letters are considered the same as the normal forms. There are no numbers with ז (zayin), כ (kaf), or צ (tsadi) in their names. ג (gimel) appears only in vocabulary transliterated into Hebrew based on Landon Curt Noll's latin-based power of 1000 naming system and not in everyday vocabulary (hence why a(3) = 10^63).
