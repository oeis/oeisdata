%N A336733 Positive integers which can be written in two bases smaller than 10 as mutually-reversed strings of digit(s).
%C A336733 Base conversion yields a string of digits which by convention has any leading zeros suppressed. However, a conversion which yields a low zero (e.g., 96_10 = 240_6) will see that zero preserved when the string of digits is reversed (e.g., into "042"), so it can never match any base-converted strings before reversal. It's therefore not possible to have a solution involving a base which exhibits a low zero for any input x. A consequence of this is that any solution will require both base-converted strings to be of the same length; considering that any solution for a sufficiently-high x will involve only bases 8 and 9 (these having the slowest rate of change with respect to x), we can deduce that the upper limit for valid solutions occurs at the point beyond which length(x base 8) - length(x base 9) is permanently greater than unity, and this can be shown to occur at 8^18, or approximately 1.80*10^16.
%C A336733 40 terms are known up to 4.7*10^13.
%C A336733 It's worthy of note that 22 has two distinct nontrivial solutions as 22_10 = 211_3 = 112_4, and 22_10 = 42_5 = 24_9.
%C A336733 As 1 through 6 have one digit in at least two distinct bases each less than 10 they are trivially included in the sequence. - _David A. Corneth_, Aug 03 2020
