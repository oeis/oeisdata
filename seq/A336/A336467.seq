%N A336467 Fully multiplicative with a(2) = 1 and a(p) = A000265(p+1) for odd primes p, with A000265(k) giving the odd part of k.
%C A336467 For the comment here, we extend the definition of the first kind of Cunningham chain (see Wikipedia-article) so that also isolated primes for which neither (p-1)/2 nor 2p+1 is a prime are considered to be in singular chains, that is, in chains of the length one. If we replace one or more instances of any particular odd prime factor p in n with any odd prime q of the same Cunningham chain, so that m = (q^k)*n / p^(e-k), where e is the exponent of p of n, and k <= e is the number of instances of p replaced with q, then it holds that a(m) = a(n), and by induction, the value stays invariant for any number of such replacements. Note also that A001222, but not necessarily A001221 will stay invariant in such changes.
%C A336467 For example, if some of the odd prime divisors p of n are Sophie Germain primes (in A005384), then replacing any of them with 2p+1 ("safe primes", i.e., the corresponding terms of A005385), gives a new number m, for which a(m) = a(n). And vice versa, the same is true for any safe prime factors > 5 of n (that are in A005385), then replacing any one of them with (p-1)/2 will not affect the result. For example, a(5*11*23*47) = a(11*11*23*23) = a(5^4) = a(11^4) = a(23^4) = 81, as 5, 11, 23 and 47 are in the same Cunningham chain of the first kind.
