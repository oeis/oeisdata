%N A336657 Numbers k such that 2^k - 1 is divisible by the sum of the distinct primes dividing k (A008472).
%C A336657 Since 2^p == 2 (mod p) for all primes p, all the terms of this sequence are composites. Similar considerations show that there are no semiprimes in this sequence.
%C A336657 The odd terms are relatively rare: 345, 385, 665, 1035, 1725, 1925, ...
%C A336657 If k is a term and d|k then d*k is also a term. In particular, all the numbers of the form 2^i * 3^j, with i > 1 and j > 0, are terms.

%F A336657 The number of terms not exceeding x is x^(1 - c_1 * log(log(log(x)))/log(log(x))) <= N(x) <= c_2 * x * log(log(x))/log(x) for all sufficiently large values of x, where c_1 and c_2 are positive constants (Banks and Luca, 2007).
%e A336657 12 = 2^2 * 3 is a term since 2^12 - 1 = 4095 is divisible by 2 + 3 = 5.
