%N A336562 Number of pairs sigma(p^x), sigma(q^y) that are not coprime, where p^x and q^y are any two maximal prime power divisors of n, with p < q. a(1) = 0.

%e A336562 For n = 40 = 2^3 * 5^1, sigma(2^3) = 15 and sigma(5) = 6, so we have one such prime power pair that the gcd of their sum of divisors is larger than one (in this case gcd(15,6) = 3), thus a(40) = 1.
%e A336562 For n = 120 = 2^3 * 3^1 * 5^1, possible pairs are [sigma(8), sigma(3)], [sigma(8), sigma(5)] and [sigma(3), sigma(5)], with gcd(15,4) = 1, gcd(15,6) = 3 and gcd(4,6) = 2, thus there are two pairs that are not coprime, and a(120) = 2.
