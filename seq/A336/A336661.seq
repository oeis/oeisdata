%N A336661 Numbers that have decimal expansion c(1)c(2)...c(n) with distinct digits that satisfy c(1) <> 0, c(1) is the largest digit, and for each i in 1..n there is j in 0..2 such that c(i) == 3*c(i-1) + j (mod 10) (with c(0): = c(n)).
%C A336661 This is one of Schuh's examples of a puzzle tree.
%C A336661 Putting the number on a circle and going clockwise, we observe that a 0 is followed by a 1 or 2; a 1 is followed by a 3, 4, or 5; a 2 is followed by a 6, 7, or 8; a 3 is followed by a 0, 1, or 9; a 4 is followed by a 2 or 3; a 5 is followed by a 6 or 7; a 6 is followed by a 0, 8, or 9; a 7 is followed by a 1, 2, or 3; an 8 is followed by a 4, 5, or 6; and a 9 is followed by a 7 or 8. (These observations assume the number has at least two digits.)
%C A336661 Schuh (pp. 25-31) uses the solution to this problem to solve the "trebles puzzle": find all numbers (with no initial 0) that are written with the same digits as their treble (the treble of k is 3*k). These numbers are listed in A023087.
%C A336661 The number 0 has been included here for two reasons: (i) we may assume that it satisfies the conditions of the problem vacuously, and (ii) its inclusion allows Schuh to solve the "treble puzzle". The numbers in A023087 are all permutations of combinations of numbers in this sequence.

%e A336661 In all the cases below, the first digit must be the largest and all the digits must be distinct.
%e A336661 4 belongs to this list because c(1) = 4 = c(0) and 4 == 3*4 + 2 (mod 10).
%e A336661 31 belongs to this list because c(1) = 3, c(2) = 1 = c(0), 3 == 3*1 (mod 10), and 1 == 3*3 + 2 (mod 10).
%e A336661 301 belongs to this list because 3 == 3*1 (mod 10), 0 == 3*3 + 1 (mod 10), and 1 == 3*0 + 1 (mod 10).
%e A336661 4301 belongs to this list because 4 == 3*1 + 1 (mod 10), 3 == 3*4 + 1 (mod 10), 0 == 3*3 + 1 (mod 10), and 1 == 3*0 + 1 (mod 10).
%e A336661 60142 belongs to this list because 6 == 3*2 (mod 10), 0 == 3*6 + 2 (mod 10), 1 == 3*0 + 1 (mod 10), 4 = 3*1 + 1 (mod 10), and 2 = 3*4 (mod 10).
