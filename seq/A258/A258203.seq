%N A258203 Natural numbers n that have the property that starting from k = n, the fixed point of the map k -> floor(tan(k)) is strictly positive, and the smallest number encountered during the iteration is also strictly positive.
%C A258203 Natural numbers n for which A258021(n) > 0 and A258201(n) > 0, or in other words, numbers n such that starting from k = n, the repeated application of map k -> floor(tan(k)) reaches 1 (or any other of strictly positive fixed points, whose existence however remains hypothetical) without ever visiting any negative number.
