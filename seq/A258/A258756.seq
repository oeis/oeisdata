%N A258756 a(n) = common difference giving the highest score in the game "Sequences" for a sequence with largest element n and as many elements as possible.
%C A258756 The aim of the game is to find, in the given numbered tiles, arithmetic sequences of at least three elements. The score for a sequence is (max element)*(common difference ^ num elements). This sequence gives the common difference which produces the best score for a sequence with largest element n, and containing as many elements as possible.
%C A258756 This sequence converges to 3, which must have something to do with the fact that log(x)/x is maximized at x=e. Is n=45 the last time a(n) is not 3?
