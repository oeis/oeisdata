%N A258883 Primitive weird numbers (PWN) of the form 2^k*p*q*r with k > 0 and where p < q < r are odd primes.
%C A258883 The condition k > 0 is not really a limitation since a product of three odd primes cannot be weird. -- Numbers of the form 2^k*p^2*q having only two distinct odd prime divisors, e.g., A258401(45) = 2319548096 = 2^6 * 137^2 * 1931 or A258401(143) = 232374697216 = 2^8 * 797^2 * 1429, are neither in A258882 nor in the present sequence as it is currently defined, although they are in the set of weird numbers 2^k*p*q*r with odd primes p,q,r. (PWN with nonsquarefree odd part are listed in A273815.) - _M. F. Hasler_, Jul 18 2016, amended Nov 09 2017
%C A258883 It appears that there are (2, 7, 12, 18, 41, ...) terms with k = valuation(a(n),2) = 1, 2, 3, etc. The smallest and largest such are (4030, 45356, 1713592, 15126992, 569494624, 5353519168, 96743686016, 1009572479744, ...) resp.
