%N A258252 Sequence of distinct positive integers having lowest possible denominators of sums of 1/a(n).
%C A258252 a(n) is chosen among the unused positive integers so that the denominator of Sum_{i=1..n} 1/a(i), is as low as possible.
%C A258252 Presumably a permutation of positive integers.
%C A258252 Primes do not always occur in natural order.
%C A258252 The numbers which retain their natural positions (that is, a(n)=n) are 1, 2, 48, 80601...
%C A258252 Inverse (A258253): 1, 2, 4, 5, 11, 3, 14, 15, 18, 8, 29, 6, 46, 9, 7, 47, 73, 17, 134, 35, 33, 26, 153, 16, 96, ..., . - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Jun 18 2015

%e A258252 After 2 terms, the partial sum of 1/a(i) reaches 3/2. Adding 1 or 1/2 is impossible, since 1 and 2 are already taken. The rest of positive integers lead to the following sums: +1/3 -> 11/6, +1/4 -> 7/4, +1/5 -> 17/10, +1/6 -> 5/3 with denominator 3 which is the lowest we can get. Hence a(3)=6.
%e A258252 For this specific term, the fractions that are encountered are 3/2 + 1/k with k>2. The resulting sequence of denominators are: 6, 4, 10, 3, 14, 8, 18, 5, 22, 12, ... (see A145979) within which the smallest term is indeed 3. - _Michel Marcus_, Jun 04 2015
