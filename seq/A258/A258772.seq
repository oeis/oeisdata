%N A258772 Number of fixed points in the Collatz (3x+1) trajectory of n.
%C A258772 This sequence uses the definition in A006370: if n is odd, n -> 3n+1 and if n is even, n -> n/2.
%C A258772 The number 3 appears first at a(187561). Do all nonnegative numbers appear? See A258821.

%e A258772 For n = 5, the trajectory is T(5) = [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]. Since the fourth term in this sequence is 4, this is a fixed point. Since there is only one fixed point, a(5) = 1.
%e A258772 For n = 6, the trajectory is T(6) = [6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]. Here, the k-th term in this trajectory does not equal k for any possible k. So a(6) = 0.
