%N A360209 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of distinct positive numbers such that, for n > 2, a(n) shares a factor with a(n-2) + a(n-1) but shares no factor with a(n-2).
%C A360209 To ensure the sequence is infinite another criterion must be satisfied when choosing a(n), namely a(n) + a(n-1) must contain a factor not in a(n-1). If this were not the case, a(n+1) = a(n) + a(n-1) would share a factor with both a(n) + a(n-1) and a(n-1), terminating the sequence.
%C A360209 In the first 100000 terms the fixed points for n > 2 are 3, 6, 441, 1677, 3629, 9701, 17131, although it is likely more exist. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.
%H A360209 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A360209/a360209_1.png">Image for n=1..100000</a>. The green line is a(n) = n.
%e A360209 a(7) = 15 as a(5) + a(6) = 4 + 6 = 10, and 15 is the smallest positive unused number that shares a factor with 10 but not with a(5) = 4.
%e A360209 a(41) = 44 as a(39) + a(40) = 47 + 30 = 77, and 44 shares a factor with 77 but not with a(39) = 47. Note that 42 also satisfies these criteria but 30 + 42 = 72 which shares all its factors with a(40) = 30, thus setting a(41) = 42 would make it impossible to find a(42).
