%N A360447 Result of inserting the integers n = 0, 1, 2, ... in this order into an initially empty list, where n is inserted between the pair of consecutive elements with sum equal to n and minimal absolute difference, or at the end of the list if no such pair exists.
%C A360447 Is this a permutation of the nonnegative integers, i.e., will any n eventually reach a stable position in the sequence? This is the case when n is no longer preceded by a pair of consecutive terms with a sum larger than the current length of the sequence.

%e A360447 For n = 0, 1, and 2, there is no pair in the sequence that sums to n, so each of these is appended to the initially empty list, which then is [0, 1, 2].
%e A360447 Now n = 3 is the sum of 1 and 2 so it is inserted between these two, so the list becomes [0, 1, 3, 2].
%e A360447 Similarly, n = 4 is inserted between 1 and 3 to get [0, 1, 4, 3, 2].
%e A360447 Then n = 5 could be inserted between 1 and 4 or 3 and 2; we have to compare the differences |1-4| and |3-2| to find that it must be inserted between 3 and 2 to get [0, 1, 4, 3, 5, 2].
%e A360447 Now n = 6 isn't the sum of any two adjacent terms, so it is appended: [0, 1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 6].
%e A360447 Then n = 7 is the sum of 4+3 as well as 5+2; as for 5 we compare the differences to find that it must be inserted between 4 and 3.
%e A360447 And so on.
%e A360447 The number 2 (which, from step 13 on, is a member of the group (10, 3, 8, 13, 5, 2, 6), later extended by (..., 15, 24, 9, 21)) gets pushed further and further while the initial terms are computed:
%e A360447 In order to get a(13) = 2213 for certain, we use the integers up to 3185, and 2 is then at position 106.
%e A360447 To get a(14) = 10093, we insert all integers up to 12306, and 2 is then at position 176.
%e A360447 To get a(15) = 17973, we use all integers up to 28066, and 2 is then at position 234. The number 7 is by then at position 119, the number 12 at position 351, and 14 at position 431 (followed by 16, 19, 20, 22 and 23 within the next 20-30 indices).
%e A360447 To get a(96) = 1345208697, one has to use all integers up to 1708015633, and 2 is then at position 4091. [Result from _Brendan McKay_]
