%N A360412 Number of binary words of length 2n with an even number of 1's which are not shuffle squares.
%C A360412 A shuffle square is a word obtained by self-shuffling, e.g., the French word "tuteurer" is a shuffle square as it can be obtained by self-shuffling the word "tuer".
%C A360412 Words with an odd number of 1's obviously are not shuffle squares.
%F A360412 a(n) = 2^(2n-1) - A191755(n), since the number of binary words of length 2n with an even number of 1's is 2^(2n-1).
%e A360412 a(3)=10, since the binary words of length 6 with an even number of 1's which are not shuffle squares are 000110, 010001, 011000, 011101, 011110, 100001, 100010, 100111, 101110 and 111001.
%Y A360412 Cf. A191755.
