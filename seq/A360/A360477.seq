%N A360477 Numbers whose product of distinct prime factors is greater than or equal to the sum of its prime factors (with repetition).
%C A360477 Numbers k where A007947(k) >= A001414(k).
%C A360477 Similar to A359870 but also includes the primes (A000040).
%C A360477 All primes are terms since in that case the product of distinct prime factors and the sum of prime factors are equal.

%e A360477 45 = 3^2*5 is a term since its product of distinct prime factors 3 * 5 = 15 is greater than its sum of prime factors with multiplicity 3 + 3 + 5 = 11.
%e A360477 48 = 2^4*3 is not a term since its product of distinct prime factors 2 * 3 = 6 is less than its sum of prime factors with multiplicity 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 11.
