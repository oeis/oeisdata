%N A360902 Numbers with the same number of squarefree divisors and powerful divisors.
%C A360902 Numbers k such that A034444(k) = A005361(k).
%C A360902 Numbers whose squarefree kernel (A007947) and powerful part (A057521) have the same number of divisors (A000005).
%C A360902 If k and m are coprime terms, then k*m is also a term.
%C A360902 All the terms are exponentially 2^n-numbers (A138302).
%C A360902 The characteristic function of this sequence depends only on prime signature.
%C A360902 Numbers whose canonical prime factorization has exponents whose geometric mean is 2.
%C A360902 Equivalently, numbers of the form Product_{i=1..m} p_i^(2^k_i), where p_i are distinct primes, and Sum_{i=1..m} k_i = m (i.e., the exponents k_i have an arithmetic mean 1).
%C A360902 1 is the only squarefree (A005117) term.
%C A360902 Includes the squares of squarefree numbers (A062503), which are the powerful (A001694) terms of this sequence.
%C A360902 The squares of primes (A001248) are the only terms that are prime powers (A246655).
%C A360902 Numbers of the for m*p^(2^k), where m is squarefree, p is prime, gcd(m, p) = 1 and omega(m) = k - 1, are all terms. In particular, this sequence includes numbers of the form p^4*q, where p != q are primes (A178739), and numbers of the form p^8*q*r where p, q, and r are distinct primes (A179747).
%C A360902 The corresponding numbers of squarefree (or powerful) divisors are 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, ... . The least term with 2^k squarefree divisors is A360903(k).
