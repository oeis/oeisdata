%N A360735 Even integers d such that the longest possible arithmetic progression (AP) of primes with common difference d has only two elements.
%C A360735 Similar sequence with odd integers d is A040976 \ {0}.
%C A360735 Terms are even numbers that are not divisible by 3 and that are not also in A206037.
%C A360735 These longest corresponding APs are of the form (q, q+d) with q odd primes (see examples).
%C A360735 This subsequence of A359408 corresponds to the second case '2 is one less than prime 3' (see A173919); the first case is linked to A040976.
%C A360735 A342309(d) gives the first element of the smallest such AP with 2 elements whose common difference is a(n) = d.

%F A360735 If m is a term then A123556(m) = 2, but the converse is false: a counterexample is A123556(11) = 2 and 11 is not a term.
%e A360735 d = 16 is a term because the first longest APs of primes with common difference 16 are (3, 19), (7,23), (13, 29), ... and all have 2 elements because next elements should be respectively 35, 39 and 45 that are all composite; the first such AP that starts with A342309(16) = 3 is (3, 19).
%e A360735 d = 22 is a term because the first longest APs of primes with common difference 22 are (7, 29), (19, 41), (31, 53), ... and all have 2 elements because next elements should be respectively 51, 63 and 75 that are all composite; the first such AP that starts with A342309(22) = 7 is (7, 29).
