%N A360328 Numbers k such that A360327(k) > 2*k.
%C A360328 Analogous to abundant numbers (A005101) with divisors that are restricted to numbers that have only prime-indexed prime factors.
%C A360328 The abundancy index of numbers in A076610 (i.e., numbers whose prime factors are only prime-indexed primes) is bounded by P = Product_{p in A006450} p/(p-1) which seems to be less than 4 (see A076610). Therefore, there are no terms k of A076610 with sigma(k) >= 4*k, or equivalently, no even terms in this sequence, and all the terms of this sequence are in A076610. Also, assuming that P < 15/4 = 3.75, there are no terms in this sequence that are coprime to 15.
%C A360328 Since P > 3 there are terms that are not divisible by 3. The least of them must be larger than Product_{k=1..21826870} A006450(k) = 3 * 5 * 11 * ... * 8958801613 > 10^206662375, because Product_{k=2..m} A006450(k)/(A006450(k)-1) > 2 only for m >= 21826870.
%C A360328 The least term that is not divisible by 5 is 789909738655399955305165431.
%C A360328 The least term that is not divisible by 11 is a(30) = 355725.
%C A360328 The least squarefree term is 14093057715.
