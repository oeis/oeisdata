%N A360659 a(n) is the minimum sum of a completely multiplicative sign sequence of length n.
%C A360659 A completely multiplicative sign sequence is a sequence S of numbers -1 and +1 such that S(a*b) = S(a)*S(b).
%C A360659 Directly from the definition, the first term of every multiplicative sign sequence is +1.
%C A360659 The number of completely multiplicative sign sequences of length n is 2^A000720(n), since every multiplicative sign sequence S is uniquely determined by the values of S on prime indexes.
%C A360659 Liouville's function A002819(n) gives the sum of the multiplicative sign sequence of length n in which every prime is assigned the value of -1. This is, therefore, an upper bound on a(n). The first difference occurs at n = 14.
%C A360659 Conjecture: For every n >= 22 there exists completely multiplicative sign sequence of length n with the minimal sum, which have +1's on initial primes and -1's on the remaining primes, i.e., its subsequence on primes is ++...+--...- for some number of +1's.
%C A360659 First differences are either 1 or -1. This is because optimum sequences for n cannot have a sum less than one less than those for n-1 and similarly optimum sequences for n cannot have a sum greater than one more than those for n-1. A zero difference is not possible because terms alternate between even and odd. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Feb 16 2023
%C A360659 Liouville's function (A002819) is unbounded below, hence this sequence is also unbounded below and every negative number occurs in the sequence. - _Rémy Sigrist_, Feb 17 2023
%C A360659 From _David A. Corneth_, May 28 2024: (Start)
%C A360659 One might ease the search by setting values with prime indices in (n/2, n] to -1 in the multiplicative function.
%C A360659 Furthermore one can use the squarefree part of n to evaluate the value of composites in the sequence. For example the value of index 60 has the same value as the one at index 15. (End)

%F A360659 a(k^2) = a(k^2-1) + 1 for k >= 1.
%F A360659 a(p) = a(p-1) - 1 for prime p. (End)
%e A360659 There are eight completely multiplicative sign sequences of length 5: +--+-, +--++, +-++-, +-+++, ++-+-, ++-++, ++++- and +++++. The sums of those sequences are, respectively, -1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3 and 5. Hence, the minimum sum is equal to -1 and so a(5) = -1.
