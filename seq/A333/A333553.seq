%e A333553 After we have found A005132(6)=13, we attempt to subtract 7 from 13 to get a(7). However, this would give 6, which is a collision, since we already have A005132(3)=6. Furthermore, 6 is larger than any collision we have so far avoided. So 7 (the index of the term of A005132 that we were constructing), gets added to the current sequence (it is a(3)).
