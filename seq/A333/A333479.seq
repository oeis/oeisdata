%N A333479 Busy Beaver for binary lambda calculus: the maximum normal form size of any closed lambda term of size n, or 0 if no closed term of size n exists.
%C A333479 Sizes in binary lambda calculus are defined by size(lambda M)=2+size(M), size(M N)=2+size(M)+size(N), and size(V)=1+i for a variable V bound by the i-th enclosing lambda.
%C A333479 Note that there is also a universal form of binary lambda calculus in which encoded lambda terms are applied to pure binary data. This busy beaver uses the simpler non-universal form with lambda terms only.
%C A333479 a(34), a(35) and a(36) correspond to Church numerals 2^2^2^2, 3^3^3, and 2^2^2^3, where numeral n has size 5*n+6.
%C A333479 a(38) > 10^19729, corresponding to Church numeral 2^2^2^2^2.
%C A333479 Only a finite number of entries can be known, as the function is uncomputable.
%C A333479 Quoting from Chaitin's paper below: "to information theorists it is clear that the correct measure is bits, not states [...] to deal with Sigma(number of bits) one would need a model of a binary computer as simple and compelling as the Turing machine model, and no obvious natural choice is at hand."

%e A333479 The smallest closed lambda term is lambda x.x with encoding 0010 of size 4, giving a(4)=4, as it is in normal form. There is no closed term of size 5, so a(5)=0. a(21)=22 because of term (lambda x. x x) (x (lambda y. x)).
