%N A083556 n-th Payam number E_{+}(n), defined as the smallest positive odd integer k such that for every positive integer n, the number k*2^n+1 is not divisible by any primes p such that the multiplicative order of 2 mod p is less than or equal to e.
%C A083556 Payam numbers are good candidates for looking for Proth primes, i.e. primes of the form k*2^n+1.
