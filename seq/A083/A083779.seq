%N A083779 n-th row of the following triangle contains n even numbers such that every sum of n-1 of them + 1 is a prime. Sequence contains the triangle by rows.
%C A083779 For n=4, the third term is 10 and not 6 as then there is no number that qualifies for the fourth place. As for every k one of the numbers 2+k, 4+k or 6+k is divisible by 3.
%C A083779 We assume that for each row we want the lexicographically earliest possible set of even numbers. - _Joshua Zucker_, May 03 2006
