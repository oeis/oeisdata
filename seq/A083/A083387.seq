%N A083387 Numbers n such that the number formed by the digits of 2n sorted in ascending order is equal to the sum of the divisors of n after the digits of each divisor have been sorted in ascending order.
%C A083387 Primes with certain digits and various combinations of those digits along with any number of zeros inserted are members. E.g., primes of the form 425(0_z)71, or 71+17*2^n*5^(n+2) for n>1 and primes of the form 25(0_z)741 or 741+2^n*5^(n+2) for n>2 etc. are in this sequence.
%e A083387 a(4)=4204 because the digits of 2*4204 sorted ascending are 488; the divisors of 4204 are [1, 2, 4, 1051, 2102, 4204] and 1+2+4+115+122+244 = 488.
