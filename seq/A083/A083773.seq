%N A083773 The n-th row of the following triangle contains n distinct numbers such that the product of (n-1) of them + 1 is always a prime. The first (n-1) numbers are the smallest set whose product +1 is a prime and the n-th term is chosen to satisfy the requirement. a(1) = 1 by convention. Sequence contains the triangle by rows.
