%N A083404 Illustration of Viswanath's constant A078416.
%C A083404 a(n) is the sum of the absolute values of the (2+n)-th terms in 2^n "random Fibonacci sequences" using either addition or subtraction.
%C A083404 Viswanath's constant V approximates a(15) = 223790 by (2*V)^15 or about 210416.
%C A083404 Approximating a(19) = 7560760 by (2*V)^19 or about 5527978 appears to be bad, why?
%C A083404 Viswanath's constant is not relevant for this sequence, since these two questions are different: what is the growth rate of almost random Fibonacci sequences, what is the average value of the n-th term of such a random Fibonacci sequence? (I've just submitted a paper to Journal of Number Theory to prove that the two problems have different solutions. I'm currently preparing a second paper which gives the explicit value of the constant involved in the context of average value of n-th term.) - Benoit Rittaud (rittaud(AT)math.univ-paris13.fr), Mar 10 2006

%F A083404 This sequence is exponentially increasing, with growth rate equal to x-1=1.20556943..., where x is the only real number solution of the equation x^3 = 2x^2 + 1. - Benoit Rittaud (rittaud(AT)math.univ-paris13.fr), Jan 20 2007
