%N A083964 Smallest palindromic multiple of 2n-1 beginning with the digit string of 2n-1; or 0 if no such number exists.
%C A083964 Conjecture: If n is not of the type (5k+1)/2 then a(n) is not zero.
%C A083964 There are two requirements: A) the number must be a multiple of k and end with the digits of reverse(k), and B) it must be palindromic. A) Let k=2n-1 and k has c digits. We seek an m such that m*k == reverse(k) (mod 10^c). This equation has solutions iff GCD(k,10^c) | reverse(k), or since k is odd, iff GCD(k,5^c) | reverse(k). B) When m exists, make an arithmetic progression a0 + i*d, i=0,1,2,... with a0=m*k and d=k*10^c. All terms end in reverse(k) and are divisible by k. While d is divisible by 10, a0 is not, since reverse(k) is never divisible by 10. According to Harminc and Sotaks theorem: "An arithmetic progression a0 + i*d contains infinitely many palindromic numbers unless both a0 and d are multiples of ten", we conclude that when m exists, there also exists a palindrome with the required properties. Example: k=5015 has a solution since GCD=5 which divides 5105, but k=5025 has not since GCD=25 which does not divide 5205. - _Lars Blomberg_, Sep 22 2013
