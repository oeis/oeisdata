%N A241854 Number m that give records for the quotient between the maximum and minimum x's such that sigma(x)=m.
%C A241854 If an integer m is equal to p+1 with p prime, then sigma(p)=m, and it is the maximum such number. The first numbers in the sequence 12, 42, 60, 168, 360, 744, 1512, 2418, 2880 as well as 2437344 are in this case. Curiously, at least up the last known term, this is not the case for the majority of terms of the sequence.
%e A241854 Only sigma(1)=1, hence the quotient is 1.
%e A241854 The next m is 12 with sigma(6)=sigma(11)=12, quotient 11/6 greater than 1.
%e A241854 Next m is 42 with [20, 26, 41] with quotient 41/20 that is greater than 11/6.
%o A241854 (PARI) lista(lim) = {v = vector(lim, i, sigma(i)); w = vector(lim); for (i=1, lim, vi = v[i]; if (vi <= lim, if (w[vi] == 0, w[vi] = i, w[vi] = concat(w[vi], i)););); rmax = -1; for (i=1, lim, if (w[i], r = vecmax(w[i]) / vecmin(w[i]); if (r > rmax, print1(i, ", "); rmax = r;);););}
%Y A241854 Cf. A241852 (similar but with difference).
