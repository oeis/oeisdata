%N A393473 Consider the square spiral in the first quadrant, as in A393433, and look at the trajectory of a knight, starting at square n, and always moving to the smallest unvisited square. Sequence gives the total length of the trajectory.
%C A393473 See A393472 for further details.
%C A393473 For starting squares less than 10000 (for larger values the initial knights path back toward the origin starts to dominate the total trajectory length) the longest trajectory is 666 for start square 42, while the shortest is 16 for start square 34. See the attached images.

%e A393473 a(34) = 16 as when starting at square 34 the complete knight's path is 34 -> 13 -> 2 -> 9 -> 6 -> 1 -> 4 -> 7 -> 0 -> 5 -> 8 -> 3 -> 14 -> 11 -> 18 -> 15, visiting 16 squares in total. At square 15 the sequence ends as from 15 all available squares have been previously visited.
