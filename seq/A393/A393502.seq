%N A393502 Start values of "paradoxical sequences" in the modified '3x+1' problem.
%C A393502 The map in this sequence is the modified Collatz map (also called Terras map): T(n odd) = (3n + 1)/2, T(n even) = n/2.
%C A393502 If, in a trajectory starting with n and with length j+1 and q the number of odd values: 3^q / 2^j < 1 and the value at position j is >= n, then the trajectory (the sequence of values) is called paradoxical.
%C A393502 Rozier and Terracol proved that if there are only finitely many paradoxical sequences whose first term is greater than 2, then the Collatz conjecture is true.
%C A393502 There are exactly 593 paradoxical sequences starting with an integer n such that 7 <= n <= 4614 and there is no other with 3 <= n <= 2.8 * 10^19 (see paper). These correspond to the 550 known starting values in this sequence.

%e A393502 Paradoxical sequence starting with 7: 7, 11, 17, 26, 13, 20, 10, 5, 8. The first condition is met: 8 >= 7. The second condition is met: 3^5 / 2^8 < 1.
