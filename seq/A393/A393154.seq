%N A393154 Number of involution pairs of graceful Prüfer codes on n vertices with one code in the first half and the other in the second half of the lexicographic order.
%C A393154 A graceful Prüfer code of length n-2 is a sequence over {0,1,...,n-1} corresponding to a gracefully labeled tree on n vertices. Each such code belongs to an involution pair obtained by applying the natural involution induced by relabeling the underlying tree. The lexicographic rank of a Prüfer code is taken among all n^(n-2) sequences of length n-2 over {0,1,...,n-1}, ordered lexicographically. Let H = n^(n-2)/2. This sequence counts involution pairs (c,c') such that rank(c) < H and rank(c') >= H (or vice versa). In other words, each counted pair is split between the two halves of the lexicographic space.

%F A393154 a(n) = A337274(n) - A393155(n) - A393156(n).
%e A393154 For n = 4, Prüfer codes have length 2 and are ordered lexicographically among all 4^2 = 16 sequences. The code (0,0) corresponds to the star K_{1,3} with center at vertex 0 and leaves {1,2,3}.
%e A393154 Similarly, the code (3,3) corresponds to the star with center at vertex 3 and leaves {0,1,2}.
%e A393154 These two codes form an involution pair obtained by exchanging the roles of the vertices using the formula f(v)=n-1-v. The lexicographic rank of (0,0) is 0, which lies in the first half {0,...,7}, while the rank of (3,3) is 15, which lies in the second half {8,...,15}.
%e A393154 Hence this pair is split between the two halves and contributes 1 to a(4).
%e A393154 The first value is a(3), because there is no Prüfer codes for trees with 1 or 2 vertices.
