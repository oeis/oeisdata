%N A393156 Number of involution pairs of graceful Prüfer codes on n vertices with both codes in the second half of the lexicographic order.
%C A393156 A graceful Prüfer code of length n-2 is a sequence over {0,1,...,n-1} corresponding to a gracefully labeled tree on n vertices. Each such code belongs to an involution pair obtained by applying the natural involution induced by relabeling the underlying tree. The lexicographic rank of a Prüfer code is taken among all n^(n-2) sequences of length n-2 over {0,1,...,n-1}, ordered lexicographically. Let H = n^(n-2)/2. This sequence counts involution pairs (c,c') such that rank(c) > H and rank(c') > H. In other words, each counted pair is laying in the second half of the lexicographic space of codes.

%F A393156 a(n) = A337274(n) - A393155(n) - A393154(n).
%e A393156 The first involution pair of graceful Prüfer codes lying entirely in the second half appears for a tree with 4 vertices. It corresponds to two graceful labelings of a path: 3-0-2-1 (Prüfer code: 2,0) and 0-3-1-2 (Prüfer code: 3,1).
