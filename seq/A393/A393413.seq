%N A393413 Decimal expansion of the limit mean of the number of continued fraction coefficients required per decimal digit for the bronze ratio.
%C A393413 For this limit, the number of decimal digits k determined by n continued fraction terms is defined by the magnitude of the approximation error: k is such that the absolute difference between the n-th convergent and the true value lies between 10^-(k+1) and 10^-k.
%C A393413 The limiting mean of the continued fraction with some number k being infinitely repeated is given by 1/(2*log_10((k+sqrt(k^2+4))/2)).
%C A393413 This constant is given by the smallest value of k for which the resulting mean is <1.
%C A393413 The limiting mean of the continued fraction for almost all other real numbers is given by the Lochs's constant A086819.
%C A393413 It is also the constant given by the value of k for which the resulting mean is the closest to the Lochs's constant.
