%N A393183 Number of non-isomorphic planar graphs with n edges that are exactly 2-vertex connected and at least 3-edge connected.
%C A393183 This sequence counts graphs H with n edges that satisfy vertex connectivity K(H) = 2 and edge connectivity l(H) >= 3.
%C A393183 These graphs arise naturally as the diagonal graphs (also known as face graphs) in the dual decomposition of 4-regular planar graphs. Specifically, they constitute the set of unique structural components used to construct the subclass of polyhedra counted in A392848.
