%N A393554 Number of ways, up to rotations and reflections, to distribute n guards on the corners and walls of an equilateral triangle castle so that each wall has an equal number of guards.
%C A393554 The three walls of the castle are defended by n guards, each of whom is assigned to one of six locations in the castle: one of the three towers at the corners of the castle, or the middle of one of the three walls. Each guard in a tower will defend the two adjoining walls, while each guard positioned at the middle of a wall will guard only that wall. The guards must be distributed so that each wall is defended by the same number of guards. If two distributions can be obtained from one another by reflection and/or rotation, they are counted as one.
