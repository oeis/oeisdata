%N A393337 Number of connected unlabeled graphs with composition number n.
%C A393337 See A392291 for the definition of composition number.
%C A393337 The null graph is not included.
%C A393337 a(n) > 0 if and only if n is in A392291.
%C A393337 Only graphs with at most A070939(n) vertices can contribute to a(n), because the composition number of a connected graph with k+1 vertices is at least 2^k (with equality if and only if the graph is a tree).
%C A393337 a(2^k) >= A000055(k+1), because a tree with k+1 vertices has composition number 2^k.
