%N A393000 Number of free polyquarcs with n cells, with cusp connections allowed.
%C A393000 The cells of the polyquarcs are quarter arcs of circles with diameter 1 in the plane, with their endpoints on the midpoints of lines between adjacent integer points; so each unit square with integer coordinates contains four such cells making up a circle. Two cells are connected if they touch (necessarily at the endpoints), together making up a semicircle, an S-shaped curve, or a cusp-shaped curve. In A392392, two cells are not considered connected if they make up a cusp-shaped curve.
%C A393000 Cells can be represented as integer points in the plane, with the neighbors of (x,y) being (x,y-s), (x-r,y), (x,y+s), (x+r,y), (x+r,y-s), (x-r,y+s), where r = (-1)^(x mod 2) and s = (-1)^(y mod 2).
%C A393000 These are free polyquarcs, so translations, rotations, and reflections are identified.
