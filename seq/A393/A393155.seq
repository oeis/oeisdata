%N A393155 Number of involution pairs of graceful Prüfer codes on n vertices with both codes in the first half of the lexicographic order.
%C A393155 A graceful Prüfer code of length n-2 is a sequence over {0,1,...,n-1} corresponding to a gracefully labeled tree on n vertices. Each such code belongs to an involution pair obtained by applying the natural involution induced by relabeling the underlying tree. The lexicographic rank of a Prüfer code is taken among all n^(n-2) sequences of length n-2 over {0,1,...,n-1}, ordered lexicographically. Let H = n^(n-2)/2. This sequence counts involution pairs (c,c') such that rank(c) < H and rank(c') < H. In other words, each counted pair is lying entirely in the first half of the space of codes.

%F A393155 a(n) = A337274(n) - A393154(n) - A393156(n).
%e A393155 The first involution pair of graceful Prüfer codes lying entirely in the first half appears for a tree with 6 vertices. It corresponds to two graceful labelings of a path: 3-5-0-4-1-2 (Prüfer code: 1,4,5,0) and 2-0-5-1-4-3 (Prüfer code: 0,5,4,1). These two codes form an involution pair obtained by exchanging the roles of the vertices using the formula f(v)=n-1-v.
