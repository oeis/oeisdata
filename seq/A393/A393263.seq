%N A393263 The smallest positive number k such that the total number of its distinct prime factors equals that of the digit reversals of k when it is written in all bases 2 to n.
%e A393263 a(7) = 13 as the total number of distinct prime factors of 13 is 1, while with digital reversals of 13 in base 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 are 11, 13, 7, 17, 8, 43 respectively, all of which have one distinct prime factor. No smaller number satisfies this criterion.
