%N A393596 Number of alternating sign matrices of size n which are sparse and full.
%C A393596 An alternating sign matrix (ASM) is sparse if it cannot be turned into another ASM by replacing nonzero entries by zeros (cf. A392029).
%C A393596 An ASM if full if it cannot be turned into another ASM by replacing zero entries by nonzero entries (cf. A392410).
%e A393596 The first ASM is neither sparse or full, because it can be turned into the last two by adding or removing nonzero entries:
