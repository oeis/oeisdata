%N A393264 The smallest number k > 1 such that the total number of its prime factors, with multiplicity, equals that of the digit reversals of k when it is written in all bases 2 to n.
%e A393264 a(7) = 67 as the total number of prime factors, with multiplicity, of 67 is 1, while with digital reversals of 67 in base 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 are 97, 41, 193, 67, 67, 211 respectively, all of which have one prime factor. No smaller number satisfies this criterion.
