%N A145265 A positive integer n is included if there exists a positive integer m such that Sum_{k>=0} floor(n/(m+k)) = n.
%C A145265 This sequence is the complement of sequence A145266. A145264(a(n)) >= 1.
%C A145265 Does this sequence contain all of those and only those, positive integers that are congruent to 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 15 (mod 18)? - _Leroy Quet_, Oct 31 2008
%C A145265 This sequence and its cross-referents may be calculated more easily by checking whether a partial sum of sum{k>=0} floor(n/(n-k)) ever equals n; that is, calculating from the top down. It appears that the terms are precisely those congruent to 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, or 15 modulo 18. - Bryce Herdt (mathidentity(AT)yahoo.com), Nov 02 2008
%H A145265 Leroy Quet, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.puzzles/browse_thread/thread/458f20b5f40a6493#">sum{k>=m} floor(n/k) = n, rec.puzzles</a> [From Bryce Herdt (mathidentity(AT)yahoo.com), Nov 02 2008]
%e A145265 Checking n = 8: floor(8/3) + floor(8/4) + floor(8/5) + floor(8/6) + floor(8/7) + floor(8/8) = 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8. So 8 is included in the sequence. Checking n = 6: floor(6/2) + floor(6/3) + floor(6/4) + floor(6/5) + floor(6/6) = 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8, which is > 6. But floor(6/3) + floor(6/4) + floor(6/5) + floor(6/6) = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5, which is < 6. So 6 is not included in the sequence.
