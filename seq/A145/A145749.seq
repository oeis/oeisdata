%N A145749 Numbers n such that sigma(n)+phi(n)=sigma(n+1)+phi(n+1).
%C A145749 If n/2 is an odd prime and n+1 is prime then n is in the sequence, the proof is easy. 8,188,285,902,2013,... are terms of the sequence which they aren't of such form. This sequence is a subsequence of A066198.
%C A145749 If p is an odd Sophie Germain prime then 2*p is in the sequence. There is no term of the sequence which is of the form 2*p where p is prime and p isn't Sophie Germain prime. A244438 gives terms of the sequence which isn't of the form 2*p where p is prime. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Aug 14 2014

%F A145749 {n: A065387(n)=A065387(n+1)}.
%e A145749 10 is in the sequence because phi(10) + sigma(10) = 4 + 18 = 22 and phi(11) + sigma(11) = 10 + 12 = 22 also.
%e A145749 12 is not in the sequence because phi(12) + sigma(12) = 4 + 28 = 32 but phi(13) + sigma(13) = 12 + 14 = 26.
