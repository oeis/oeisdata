%N A257371 Number of states in minimal DFA for P_n^*, where P_n is the set of base-2 representations of the first n prime numbers.
%C A257371 Here by "DFA" we mean "deterministic finite automaton", and by P_n^* we mean the set of all binary strings that can be formed as the concatenation of 0 or more of the base-2 representations of the first n primes.  The DFA must be "complete" (there must be a transition for each state and symbol) and hence includes any "dead state".
%C A257371 P_n^* is identical to P_{n-1}^* when prime(n) in binary is the concatenation of smaller primes, since it adds nothing to the pattern.  So a(n) = a(n-1) when n in A090423, though various other a(n) = a(m) occur too when different state machines happen to have the same state count. - _Kevin Ryde_, Dec 26 2020

%e A257371 From _Kevin Ryde_, Dec 26 2020: (Start)
%e A257371 For n=3, primes 2,3,5 in binary are 10,11,101 and the regular expression is P_3^* = (10|11|101)*.  State machine manipulations, or some thought about these bits, gives the following minimum DFA comprising a(3) = 5 states.  States A,C,D are accepting.  States B and dead are non-accepting.  Dead is reached when some initial part of the input string shows the whole will not match, no matter what follows.
