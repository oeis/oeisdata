%N A257874 Numbers n such that the largest prime divisor of n^4 + n^2 + 1 is equal to the largest prime divisor of (n+1)^4 + (n+1)^2 + 1.
%C A257874 The sequence is infinite. Proof:
%C A257874 Let p(n) denote the largest prime divisor of n^4 + n^2 + 1 and let q(n) denote the largest prime divisor of n^2 + n + 1. Then p(n) = q(n^2), and from
%C A257874 n^4 + n^2 + 1 = (n^2+1)^2 - n^2 = (n^2-n+1)(n^2+n+1)= ((n-1)^2 + (n-1)+1)(n^2+n+1) it follows that p(n) = max{q(n),q(n-1)} for n>=2.
%C A257874 Keeping in mind that n^2-n+1 is odd, we have
%C A257874 gcd(n^2+n+1,n^2-n+1) = gcd(2n,n^2-n+1)= gcd(n,n^2-n+1)= 1.
%C A257874 Therefore q(n) is different from q(n-1).
%C A257874 To prove the result, it suffices to show that the set
%C A257874 S = {n in Z | n>=2 and q(n) > q(n-1) and q(n) > q(n+1)}
%C A257874 is infinite, since for each n in S one has
%C A257874 p(n) = max{q(n),q(n-1)} = q(n) = max{q(n),q(n+1)} = p(n+1).
%C A257874 Suppose on the contrary that S is finite. Since q(2) = 7 < 13 = q(3) and q(3) = 13 > 7 = q(4), the set S is nonempty. Since it is finite, we can consider its largest element, say m.
%C A257874 Note that it is impossible that q(m)>q(m+1)>q(m+2)>... because all these numbers are positive integers, so there exists a number k>=m such that q(k)<q(k+1) (recall that q(k) is different from q(k+1)). Next observe that it is impossible to have q(k)<q(k+1)<q(k+2)<... because q((k+1)^2) = p(k+1) = max{q(k),q(k+1)}, so let us take the smallest l >= k+1 such that q(l)>q(l+1). By the minimality of l, we have q(l-1)<q(l), so l is in S. Since l >= k + 1 > k >= m, this contradicts the maximality of m, and hence S is indeed infinite.

%e A257874 3 is in the sequence because 3^4+3^2+1 = 91 = 13*7 and 4^4+4^2+1 = 273 = 13*7*3, so 13 is the greatest prime factor of both expressions.
