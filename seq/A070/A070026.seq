%N A070026 Initial, all intermediate and final iterated sums of digits of n are primes.
%C A070026 2999 = A062802(4) is the smallest term of this sequence for which the second iterated sum of digits is not the final sum; i.e. the smallest requiring three summations (2+9+9+9=29, 2+9=11, 1+1=2 and all three sums are prime). (The corresponding statement about the very large A062802(5) is not true because a large number of smaller nonprimes of the same digit length also have the digit sum 2999, the least being 29999..., where 333 9's follow the 2.). A062802, a sequence of primes, is a subsequence of this sequence and of A070027.
%C A070026 Additional terms can be generated by finding the next number whose digit sum is a prime already in the sequence. - _Felix Fröhlich_, Jun 13 2014

%e A070026 47 is here because 4+7=11 and 11 is prime while also 1+1=2 and 2 is prime. 39 (in A028835) is not a term: 3+9=12 is not prime - although 1+2=3 is prime. 49 (in A028834) is not a term: 4+9=13 is prime but 1+3=4 is not prime.
%Y A070026 Cf. A028834 (Initial sum is prime), A028835 (Final sum is prime), A062802, A070027 (Primes from this sequence).
