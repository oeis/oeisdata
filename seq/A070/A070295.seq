%N A070295 Smallest composite number such that there are exactly n primes less than it (and coprime to it) which do not divide it, or 0 if no such number exists.
%C A070295 Are there any zero values other than a(11) = 0?
%e A070295 a(4) = 14: primes up to 14 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 out of which four primes 3, 5, 11 and 13 are coprime to 14.
