%N A070191 Numbers k such that gcd(3*k, 8^k+1) = 3.
%C A070191 The listed terms are the same as those in A069040, but the sequences are not identical. (The similarity is mostly explained by the absence of multiples of 2, 3 and 55 from both sequences.) See A070192 and A070193 for the differences.
%C A070191 The number of terms not exceeding 10^m, for m = 1, 2, ..., are 3, 32, 325, 3244, 32468, 324667, 3246642, 32466291, 324662816, 3246627133, ... . Apparently, the asymptotic density of this sequence exists and equals 0.32466... . - _Amiram Eldar_, Jun 14 2022
