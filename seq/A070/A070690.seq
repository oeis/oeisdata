%N A070690 a(n) = n^7 mod 5.
%C A070690 The same as A070471. [Proof: (n^7-n^3) =0 (mod 5) can be shown to be correct by testing n=0 to 4. Alternatively n^7-n^3=n^3*(n^2+1)*(n+1)*(n-1) where n^3=0,1,3,2,4 (mod 5), n^2+1 = 1,2,0,0,2 (mod 5), n+1=1,2,3,4,0 (mod 5) and n-1=4,0,1,2,3 (mod 5), such that one of the factors is 0 (mod 5) for any n]. - _R.
