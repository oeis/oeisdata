%N A324950 Number of cyclic change-ringing sequences of length n for 8 bells.
%C A324950 a(n) is the number of (change-ringing) sequences of length[*] n when we are looking at sequences of permutations of the set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8} that satisfy:
%C A324950 1. The position of each bell (number) from one permutation to the next can stay the same or move by at most one place.
%C A324950 2. No permutation can be repeated except for the starting permutation which can be repeated at most once at the end of the sequence to accommodate criterion 4.
%C A324950 3. The sequence must start with the permutation (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8).
%C A324950 4. The sequence must end with the same permutation that it started with.
%C A324950 [*]: We define the length of a change-ringing sequence to be the number of permutations in the sequence.
%C A324950 With this [*] definition of the length of a change-ringing sequence; for 8 bells we get a maximum length of factorial(8)=40320, thus we have 40320 possible lengths, namely 1,2,...,40320. Hence {a(n)} has 40320 terms. For m bells, where m is a natural number larger than zero, we get a maximum length of factorial(m). When denoting the number of cyclic change-ringing sequences of length n for m bells as a_m(n), {a_m(n)} has factorial(m) terms for all m.
