%N A324689 List of all starting positions for which no position is revisited according to the following rules. On the k-th step (k=1,2,3,...) move a distance of k in the direction of zero. If the number landed on has been landed on before, move a distance of k away.
%e A324689 Starting at zero the only point visited is zero, starting at one the points are 1 and 0, and starting at two the points visited are 2,1,-1,-4, and 0.  In all three cases, no position is revisited, thus 0,1, and 2 are all included on the list.
