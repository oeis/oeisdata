%N A324690 List of all starting positions for which all moves away from zero, if any, occur at negative positions, according to the following rules. On the k-th step (k=1,2,3,...) move a distance of k in the direction of zero. If the number landed on has been landed on before, move a distance of k away.
%e A324690 Starting at 2, the points visited are 2,1,-1,-4,0 and the only move away from zero, from -1 to -4, occurs at a negative position.  Thus 2 is a term.
