%N A324179 Number of distinct values A297167 obtains over divisors > 1 of n, minus number of prime factors of n counted with multiplicity: a(n) = A324190(n) - A001222(n).
%C A324179 a(n) is zero for all prime powers (A000961), but also for many other numbers.

%F A324179 a(n) <= A324192(n).
%e A324179 Divisors of 56 larger than 1 are [2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56]. When A297167 is applied to each, one obtains values: [0, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5], of which 6 values are distinct (as one of them, 3, occurs twice). On the other hand, 56 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 7 has four prime factors in total, thus a(56) = 6 - 4 = 2.
