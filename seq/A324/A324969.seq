%N A324969 Number of unlabeled rooted identity trees with n vertices whose non-leaf terminal subtrees are all different.
%C A324969 A rooted identity tree is an unlabeled rooted tree with no repeated branches directly under the same root. This sequence counts rooted identity trees satisfying the additional condition that all non-leaf terminal subtrees are different.
%C A324969 Appears to be essentially the same as the Fibonacci sequence A000045. - _R. J. Mathar_, Mar 28 2019
%C A324969 From _Michael Somos_, Nov 22 2019: (Start)
%C A324969 A terminal subtree T' of a tree T is a subtree all of whose vertices except one have the same degree in T' as in T itself.
%C A324969 The conjecture of Mathar is true. Proof: Given a rooted identity tree T, a terminal subtree T' with more than one vertex contains at least one edge that is also a terminal subtree of T'. Thus, if T has more than one branch with more than one vertex, then it fails the additional condition since it would have at least two non-leaf terminal subtrees (namely edges) that are the same.  Also, T can't have under its root more than one branch with exactly one vertex because it is an identity tree. Now we know that under the root of T is exactly one branch of the same kind as T or else it has exactly one other branch with exactly one vertex. The leads immediately to the same recurrence as A000045 the Fibonacci sequence except for n=3. (End)
