%N A114144 A variant of the Josephus Problem in which three persons are to be eliminated at the same time.
%C A114144 This is a variant of the Josephus Problem. When there are 3m persons, the first process of elimination starts with the first person, the second with the (m+1)-st person and the third with the (2m+1)-st person. We suppose that the first process comes first, the second process secondly and the third process thirdly. J(n) is the position of the survivor when there are n persons. Our sequence is a(n) = J(3*n).

%F A114144 The function J(n) is defined only for integers n that have 3 as a factor. J(6m+3) = 2J(3m)+2m+2 (if J(3m) <= m), J(6m+3) = 2J(3m)+2m+3 (if m+1 <= J(3m) <= 2m) and J(6m+3) = 2J(3m)-4m+1 (if 2m+1 <= J(3m)). J(6m) = 2J(3m)+2m-1 (if J(3m) <= 2m) and J(6m) = 2J(3m)-4m-1 (if J(3m) > 2m).
%e A114144 If there are 15 persons, then 2, 7, 12, 4, 9, 14, 6, 11, 1, 10, 15, 5, 3, 13 are to be eliminated and the survivor is 8. Therefore a(5) = J(15) = 8.
