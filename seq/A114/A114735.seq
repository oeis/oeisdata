%N A114735 Least odd number k such that Phi(k,x) is a flat cyclotomic polynomial of order n.
%C A114735 A flat polynomial is defined to be a polynomial whose coefficients are -1, 0, or 1. Order n means that k is the product of n distinct odd primes. Although the first four numbers are triangular (A000217), this appears to be a coincidence. Are there flat cyclotomic polynomials of all orders?
%C A114735 Conjecture that the next two terms are 746443728915 = 3 * 5 * 31 * 929 * 1727939 and 7800513423460801052132265 = 3 * 5 * 31 * 929 * 1727941 * 10450224300389. [_T. D. Noe_, Apr 13 2010]
%C A114735 In 2010, Andrew Arnold reported to me that the order of 746443728915 is 3. His paper has details about how the computation was done. - _T. D. Noe_, Mar 20 2013
