%N A114987 Numbers with a 3-almost prime number of prime divisors (counted with multiplicity).
%C A114987 This is the 3-almost prime analog of A063989 "numbers with a prime number of prime divisors (counted with multiplicity)" and A110893 "numbers with a semiprime number of prime divisors (counted with multiplicity)." Below 4096, this is identical to 8-almost primes (A014613). Between 4096 and 6144, this is identical to 8-almost primes. Below 262144 this is identical to the union of 8-almost primes (A014613) and 12-almost primes (A069273). Between 262144 and 393216, this is identical to the union of 8-almost primes and 12-almost primes.

%e A114987 a(1) = 256 because 256 = 2^8, which has a 3-almost prime (8) number of prime factors with multiplicity.
%e A114987 a(38) = 4096 because 4096 = 2^12, which has a 3-almost prime (12) number of prime factors with multiplicity.
