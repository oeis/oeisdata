%N A114430 Primes of the form 1 + product of the first n 3-almost primes A014612.
%C A114430 3-almost prime analog of primorial primes A005234 (primes p such that 1 + product of primes up to p is prime) as indexed by A014545 (n such that n-th Euclid number (A006862(n)) = 1 + (Product of first n primes) is prime). In that sense, this sequence is indexed by (2, 8, 9, 10, 19, ...).
%F A114430 {a(n)} = {1 + Prod[from i = 1 to n] A014612(i)} INTERSECTION {A000040}.
%e A114430 a(1) = 97 = 96 + 1 = 1 + (8 * 12) = 1 + A014612(1)*A014612(2) = 1 more than the product of the first 2 of the 3-almost primes and is prime.
%e A114430 a(2) = 32920473601 = 1 + (8 * 12 * 18 * 20 * 27 * 28 * 30 * 42) = 1 more than the product of the first 8 of the 3-almost primes and is prime.
%e A114430 a(3) = 1 more than the product of the first 9 of the 3-almost primes and is prime.
%e A114430 a(4) = 1 more than the product of the first 10 of the 3-almost primes and is prime.
%e A114430 a(5) = 1 more than the product of the first 19 of the 3-almost primes and is prime.
