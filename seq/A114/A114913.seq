%N A114913 Numbers n such that A114912(n)=1. Numbers n such that A000009(n) == 2 (mod 4).
%C A114913 All terms are the sum of a generalized pentagonal number A001318 and a square A000290.
%C A114913 Let 24*n+1 = p_1^e_1 * ... * p_r^e_r * q_1^f_1 * ... * q_s^f_s, where the p_i's are distinct primes == 1, 5, 7, or 11 (mod 24) and the q_i's are distinct primes == 13, 17, 19, or 23 (mod 24). Then n belongs to the sequence iff all of the f_i's are even and all but one of the e_i's are even and the one e_i which is odd is == 1 (mod 4). (_Dean Hickerson_, Jan 19 2006)
%C A114913 All values are the sum of a generalized pentagonal number A001318 and a square A000290.
