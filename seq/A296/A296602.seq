%N A296602 Values of F for which there is a unique convex polyhedron with F faces that are all regular polygons.
%C A296602 The main entry for this sequence is A180916.
%C A296602 All terms except 4 are odd, because both the cube and the pentagonal pyramid have 6 faces, and for any even F > 6 both a prism and an antiprism can have F faces.  Platonic solids, Archimedean solids, Johnson solids, and prisms account for the missing odd numbers.
%H A296602 <a href="/index/Rec#order_02">Index entries for linear recurrences with constant coefficients</a>, signature (2,-1).
%F A296602 A180916(a(n)) = 1.
%F A296602 From _Colin Barker_, Jul 05 2020: (Start)
%F A296602 G.f.: x*(4 + 11*x - 11*x^2 - 2*x^3 + 2*x^4 - 2*x^5 + 2*x^8 - 2*x^9 + 2*x^12 - 2*x^13) / (1 - x)^2.
%F A296602 a(n) = 2*a(n-1) - a(n-2) for n>14.
%F A296602 (End)
%e A296602 The regular tetrahedron is the only convex polyhedron with 4 faces that are all regular polygons, and no such polyhedron with fewer than 4 faces exists, so a(1) = 4.
