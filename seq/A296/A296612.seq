%N A296612 Square array read by antidiagonals upwards: T(n,k) equals k times the number of compositions (ordered partitions) of n, with n >= 0 and k >= 1.
%C A296612 Also, at least for the first five columns, column k gives the row lengths of the irregular triangles of the first differences of the total number of elements in the structure of some cellular automata. Indeed, the study of the structure and the behavior of the toothpick cellular automaton on triangular grid (A296510), and other C.A. of the same family, reveals that some cellular automata that have recurrent periods can be represented by irregular triangles (of first differences) whose row lengths are the terms of A011782 multiplied by k (instead of powers of 2), where k is the length of an internal cycle. This internal cycle is called here "word" of a cellular automaton (see examples).
