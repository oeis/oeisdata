%e A296563 a(1) = 23 is a prime, and replacing each of its digits by its cube yields 827, which is also prime. Neither 23 nor 827 contains digits 0 or 1, so both are Yarborough primes.
%e A296563 a(4) = 229 is a prime, and replacing each of its digits by its cube gives 88729, which is also prime. Neither 229 nor 88729 contains digits 0 or 1, so both are Yarborough primes.
%e A296563 29 is a Yarborough prime but 8729 = 7 * 29 * 43, so 29 is not in the sequence.
%e A296563 53 is a Yarborough prime; 12527 is also a prime but not a Yarborough prime (contains digit 1). Hence, 53 is not included in this sequence.
