%N A296241 Finite number of units in a commutative ring; nonnegative even numbers together with products of Mersenne numbers.
%C A296241 Zero together with orders of finite abelian groups that appear as the group of units in a commutative ring (Chebolu and Lockridge).
%C A296241 Equals A005843 union A282572.
%C A296241 Also the possible number of units in a (commutative or non-commutative) ring, since every odd number that is the number of units of a ring must be in this sequence (Ditor's theorem, stated in the S. Chebolu and K. Lockridge link). - _Jianing Song_, Dec 24 2021
