%N A115788 a(n) = floor(n*Pi) mod 2.
%C A115788 The arithmetic mean (1/(n+1))*Sum_{k=0...n} a(k) converges to 1/2. What is effectively the same: the Cesaro limit (C1) of a(n) is 1/2. When we pick a term of the sequence at random, the probability of getting a '1' is 1/2. If we select a '1' randomly, the probability p11 of finding a '1' as the next term right of it is p11 = Pi - 3. If we select a '1' randomly, the probability p10 of finding a '0' as the next term right of it is p10 = 4 - Pi. Analogous statements hold for '0' --> '0' (p00 = p11) and '0' --> '1' (p01 = p10).
%C A115788 First differs from A195062 at a(113). - _Alois P. Heinz_, Jan 22 2012
