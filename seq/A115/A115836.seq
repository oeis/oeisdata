%N A115836 Self-describing sequence. The n-th integer of the sequence indicates how many integers of the sequence are strictly < 2n.
%C A115836 Terms computed by Gilles Sadowski. In building step by step the sequence one has sometimes the choice for an integer. If so take the smallest available one.
