%N A115614 Numbers n such that the smallest possible number of multiplications required to compute x^n is by 2 less than the number of multiplications obtained by Knuth's power tree method.
%C A115614 The sequence is based on a table of shortest addition chain lengths computed by _Neill M. Clift_, see link to _Achim Flammenkamp_'s web page given at A003313.

%e A115614 a(1)=8719 because this is the smallest number for which the addition chain produced by the power tree method [1 2 3 5 7 14 28 56 61 117 234 468 936 1872 3744 3861 7722 7783 8719] is by two terms longer than the shortest possible chains for this number. An example of such a chain is [1 2 3 6 9 15 17 34 68 136 272 544 1088 2176 4352 4367 8719].
