%N A115869 Smallest natural number m < n, such that there exists nonzero solutions to a cross-domain congruence m*i = n X i, zero if no such integer exists.
%C A115869 Here * stands for ordinary multiplication and X means carryless (GF(2)[X]) multiplication (A048720).
%H A115869 <a href="/index/Con#CongruCrossDomain">Index entries for sequences defined by congruent products between domains N and GF(2)[X]</a>
%Y A115869 a(2n) = 2*a(n). Bisection A115870 gives the terms at odd positions. Differs from A115859 for the first time at n=23, where a(23)=15, while A115859(23)=19. Cf. A115857, A115861, A115871.
