%N A115861 Number of integers m in range 1 .. n-1, such that there exists at least one such i in range 1 .. n^3 for which m*i = A048720(n, i), where A048720 is carryless base-2 multiplication.
%C A115861 The original name was "Number of distinct m's < n, such that there exists nonzero solutions to a cross-domain congruence m*i = n X i.", but I am not sure whether that is well defined if the range of i is not restricted. Using n^3 as the upper search limit reproduced the original 102 initial terms. I don't know whether using larger values, like n^4 or n^5 would increase the values of some terms. - _Antti Karttunen_, Dec 15 2025

%F A115861 For all n, a(2*n) = a(n).
%e A115861 With n=23, we have two such pairs [m, i] that i <= 23^3 and m*i = A048720(23, i). They are [15, 5] and [19, 3], as 15*5 = A048720(23,5) = 75 and 19*3 = A048720(23,3) = 57, therefore a(23) = 2. - _Antti Karttunen_, Dec 15 2025
