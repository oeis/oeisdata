%N A115615 Numbers n such that the smallest possible number of multiplications required to compute x^n is by 3 less than the number of multiplications obtained by Knuth's power tree method.
%C A115615 The sequence is based on a table of shortest addition chain lengths computed by _Neill M. Clift_, see link to _Achim Flammenkamp_'s web page given at A003313.
%e A115615 a(1)=6475341 because this is the smallest number for which the addition chain produced by the power tree method [1 2 3 5 7 14 19 38 76 79 158 316 632 1264 2528 5056 5063 10119 12647 25294 50588 101176 202352 404704 809408 809427 1618835 3237670 6475340 6475341] is by three terms longer than the shortest possible chains for this number. An example of such a chain is [1 2 4 8 16 32 64 65 129 258 387 774 1548 1613 3161 6322 12644 25288 50576 101152 202304 404608 809216 1618432 3236864 3238477 6475341].
