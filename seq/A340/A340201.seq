%N A340201 Number of sets in the geometry determined by the Hausdorff metric at each location between two sets defined by a complete bipartite graph K(5,n) (with n at least 3) missing two edges, where the two removed edges are not incident to the same vertex in the 5-point set and are also not incident to the same vertex in the other set.
%C A340201 Start with a complete bipartite graph K(5,n) with vertex sets A and B where |A| = 5 and |B| is at least 3. We can arrange the points in sets A and B such that h(A,B) = d(a,b) for all a in A and b in B, where h is the Hausdorff metric. The pair [A,B] is a configuration. Then a set C is between A and B at location s if h(A,C) = h(C,B) = h(A,B) and h(A,C) = s. Call a pair ab, where a is in A and b is in B an edge. This sequence provides the number of sets between sets A' and B' at location s in a new configuration [A',B'] obtained from [A,B] by removing two edges, where the two removed edges are not incident to the same point in A and are also not incident to the same point in B. So this sequence tells the number of sets at each location on the line segment between A' and B'.
%C A340201 Number of {0,1} 5 X n matrices (with n at least 3) with two fixed zero entries not in the same row or column and no zero rows or columns.
%C A340201 Take a complete bipartite graph K(5,n) (with n at least 3) having parts A and B where |A| = 5. This sequence gives the number of edge covers of the graph obtained from this K(5,n) graph after removing two edges, where the two removed edges are not incident to the same vertex in A and are also not incident to the same vertex in B.
