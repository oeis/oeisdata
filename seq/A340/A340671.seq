%N A340671 a(n) is the number of values m such that, if the first n positive integers are arranged in alphabetical order in US English, the m-th term in the order is equal to m.
%C A340671 Nonnegative integers can be used instead of positive integers, since zero will always be the last element alphabetically and will not change the sequence of the other integers.
%C A340671 This sequence uses standard US English names for numbers. "and" is not used, e.g., 101 is rendered as "one hundred one" rather than "one hundred and one".
%C A340671 a(n) is equivalent to the number of terms in the n-th row of A124172 for which the term in the k-th column is equal to k.
%C A340671 For n < 100, a(n) + 2 = a(200 + n). This is because a(200) = 2, and the numbers starting with "two hundred" will follow all of 1-199 alphabetically, so the range [201, 200 + n] will be in the same order as [1, n]. Similarly, because a(2000) = 4, for n < 999, a(n) + 4 = a(2000 + n). [Editor's note: It is unclear how the author finds a(2000) = 4. Both versions mentioned below give a(2000) = 2. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jul 05 2024]
%C A340671 From _Claudio Meller_, _Hans Havermann_ and _Michael S. Branicky_, Jul 03 2024: (Start)
%C A340671 A formalization of Philip Cohen's solution to "Alphabetizing the Integers" in (Eckler, p. 20).
%C A340671 When alphabetizing in the b-file and a-file, the space is assumed to precede any letter, so EIGHT HUNDRED comes before EIGHTEEN. No commas are used, but hyphens are used. (End)
%C A340671 At least two variants of this sequence are conceivable, depending on whether spaces and hyphens are considered or ignored, when sorting the English names of the numbers. If spaces are considered, "eight hundred" comes before "eighteen"; if they are ignored, "eighteen" comes only after all of "eight hundred ...". The two variants would not differ until a(815), where "eighteen" would be the only "fixed point" (i.e., listed at the 18th place) in the first variant, but not in the second variant (where it is listed in the 2nd place, after "eight"). - _M.
