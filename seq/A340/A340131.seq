%N A340131 Numbers whose ternary expansions have the same number of 1's and 2's and, in each prefix (initial fragment), at least as many 1's as 2's.
%C A340131 For a nonzero term, the ternary code starts with 1, otherwise the balance of 1's and 2's is broken already in the one-digit prefix. Therefore 7, 19, 21, etc. (see A039001) are not terms.
%C A340131 As another example, for the integer 52 the balance is broken in the three-digit prefix 122 (the entire ternary code is 1221).
%C A340131 Each term with a ternary code of length k corresponds one-to-one to the Motzkin path of length k that starts with an up step. Therefore, the terms can be called digitized Motzkin paths.
%C A340131 The number of terms with a ternary code of length k is equal to A244884(k). Example: five terms 29, 33, 44, 45 and 50 have a ternary length of 4, respectively A244884(4)=5.

%e A340131 The first terms 0 and 5 are obvious, because the four intermediate ternary codes 1, 2, 10[3], and 11[4] are rejected due to a violation of the balance of 1's and 2's. Next, the successor function S works: for any term x, the next term is S(x).
%e A340131 Iterating over numbers is inefficient; code suffixes (final digits) can be processed faster. The transition from 0 to 12[5] is generalized for terms that are multiples of 9. For example,
%e A340131 S(10200[99]) = 10212[104], S(1122000[1188]) = 1122012[1193], etc.
%e A340131 In this case, the calculation of the subsequent term is reduced to simply replacing the suffix s = 00 with the subsequent suffix s'= 12.
%e A340131 Another common suffix is s = 02..2 = 02^k (twos are repeated at the end of the ternary code). Then the subsequent suffix is s'= 202..2 = 202^(k-1), i.e., within such a suffix, the first two digits are reversed. Here are some examples:
%e A340131 k = 1, S(1002[29]) = 1020[33], the increment is 4*3^0 = 4;
%e A340131 k = 2, S(110022[332]) = 110202[344], the increment is 4*3^1 = 12;
%e A340131 k = 3, S(10110222[2537]) = 10112022[2573], the increment is 4*3^2 = 36;
%e A340131 k = 4, S(111102222[9800]) = 111120222[9908], the increment is 4*3^3 = 108.
%e A340131 There are 5 such group suffixes.
