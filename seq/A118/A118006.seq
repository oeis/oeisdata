%N A118006 Define a sequence of binary words by w(1) = 01 and w(n+1) = w(n)w(n)Reverse[w(n)]. Sequence gives the limiting word w(infinity).
%C A118006 This is a cube-free sequence [Allouche and Shallit]. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Aug 29 2023
%C A118006 The article by W. Hebisch and M. Rubey gives a conjectured functional equation for the g.f. for this sequence. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Sep 08 2010
%C A118006 The formula in Hebisch and Rubey has an extra left parenthesis before f(x). - _Michael Somos_, Jan 03 2011
%C A118006 From _Michel Dekking_, Sep 10 2020: (Start)
%C A118006 This sequence is an automatic sequence, i.e., the letter-to-letter image of the fixed point of a uniform morphism mu.
%C A118006 In fact, one can take the alphabet {1,2,3,4} with the morphism
%C A118006       mu:  1->121,  2->234, 3->123, 4->434,
%C A118006 and the letter-to-letter map g defined by
%C A118006       g:  1->0, 2->1, 3->1, 4->0.
%C A118006 Then (a(n)) = g(x), where x = 121234121... is the fixed point of the morphism mu starting with 1.
%C A118006 This is obtained by translating the recursion relation for w to the morphism a->aab, b->abb, and then decorating the fixed point aabaababb.... of this morphism with a->01, b->10, since the recursion starts at w(1) = 01.
%C A118006 It is well-known that decorated fixed points of morphisms are morphic sequences, and the 'natural' algorithm to achieve this (see my paper "Morphic words, Beatty sequences and integer images of the Fibonacci language") yields a morphism on an alphabet of 2+2 = 4 symbols. In general there are several choices for mu. Here we have chosen mu such that it has constant length, i.e., the morphism is uniform.
%C A118006 (End)
%C A118006 Morphism a->aab, b->abb is Stewart's choral sequence A116178 (ternary lowest non-1 digit, halved).  Decoration 01 and 10 is then an interleaving of that sequence and its complement so a(2n+1) = A116178(n) and a(2n+2) = 1-A116178(n) = A136442(n). - _Kevin Ryde_, Sep 29 2020
