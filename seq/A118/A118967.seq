%N A118967 If n doesn't occur among the first (n-1) terms of the sequence, then a(n) = 2n. If n occurs among the first (n-1) terms of the sequence, then a(n) = n/2.
%C A118967 Sequence is a permutation of the positive integers. It also is its own inverse (i.e. a(a(n)) = n).
%C A118967 From _Carl R. White_, Aug 23 2010: (Start)
%C A118967 Powers of two with even exponent exchange places with the next lowest power of two with odd exponent and vice versa, i.e., 4 swaps with 2, 256 with 128, etc.
%C A118967 For other numbers where n > 1, the even component (the power of two in n's prime factorization) is exchanged the opposite way: A power of two with _odd_ component is exchanged for the next lowest (even exponent) power of two and vice versa. (End)
