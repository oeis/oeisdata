%N A118814 Number of 'tree-like curves' with n intersection points.
%C A118814 The objects being enumerated are a subset of those enumerated by A008983. The restriction involved is that the Gauss diagram (or chord diagram) has no intersecting chords.
%D A118814 V. I. Arnold, Topological Invariants of plane curves and caustics, AMS, 1994, page 12.
%H A118814 Andrei Zabolotskii, <a href="https://github.com/colt-browning/closed_curves">closed_curves</a> - a program computing the sequence (2025).
%e A118814 The first 3 entries are the same as A008983 because, for less than 3 intersection points, all curves are tree-like. For 3 intersection points there are only 2 curves that are not tree-like. They appear as the 4th and 15th entries in the table for n=3, on page 14 of Arnold's book.
%Y A118814 Cf. A008983.
