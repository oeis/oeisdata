%N A118278 Conjectured largest number that is not the sum of three n-gonal numbers, or -1 if there is no largest number.
%C A118278 Extensive calculations show that if a(n) >= 0, then every number greater than a(n) can be represented as the sum of three n-gonal numbers. a(3)=0 because every number can be written as the sum of three triangular numbers. When n is a multiple of 4, there is an infinite set of numbers not representable. For n=14, there appears to be a sparse, but infinite, set of numbers not representable.
