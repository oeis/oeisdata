%N A134419 Numbers n for which the generalized Pell equation x^2 - n*y^2 = n(n-1)(n+1)/3 has an integer solution for x and y.
%C A134419 This generalized Pell equation appears in the solution of problems posed in A001032 (and A001033): numbers n such that the sum of squares of n consecutive (odd) positive integers is a square. This sequence is the union of A001032, A001033 and the number 4, which is not a solution to either problem. When n is a square > 1 and not divisible by 3, then the equation has only a finite number of solutions; otherwise it has an infinite number of solutions.
%C A134419 For an n in this sequence, consider solutions with x>0 and y>n. (For n=4, there will be no such solutions.) If y-n+1 is even, then n is in A001032, the n consecutive positive integers begin with (y-n+1)/2 and the sum of the squares is x/2. If y-n+1 is odd, then the n is in A001033, the n consecutive odd positive integers begin with y-n+1 and the sum of the squares is x. For some n, such as 33, there are solutions y1 and y2 such that y1-n+1 is even and y2-n+1 is odd. In this case, n is in both A001032 and A001033.
%C A134419 The reason that 4 is not in A001033 is that there is no sequence of 4 consecutive positive odd squares that add to a square.  However, there is a sequence of 4 consecutive odd integers whose squares add up to a square:  (-1)^2 + 1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 = 6^2. - _Thomas Andrews_, Feb 22 2011
