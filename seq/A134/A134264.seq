%N A134264 Coefficients T(j, k) of a partition transform for Lagrange compositional inversion of a function or generating series in terms of the coefficients of the power series for its reciprocal. Enumeration of noncrossing partitions and primitive parking functions. T(n,k) for n >= 1 and 1 <= k <= A000041(n-1), an irregular triangle read by rows.
%C A134264 Coefficients are listed in Abramowitz and Stegun order (A036036).
%C A134264 Given an invertible function f(t) analytic about t=0 (or a formal power series) with f(0)=0 and Df(0) not equal to 0, form h(t) = t / f(t) and let h_n denote the coefficient of t^n in h(t).
%C A134264 Lagrange inversion gives the compositional inverse about t=0 as g(t) = Sum_{j>=1} ( t^j * (1/j) * Sum_{permutations s with s(1) + s(2) + ... + s(j) = j - 1} h_s(1) * h_s(2) * ... * h_s(j) ) = t * T(1,1) * h_0 + Sum_{j>=2} ( t^j * Sum_{k=1..(# of partitions for j-1)} T(j,k) * H(j-1,k ; h_0,h_1,...) ), where H(j-1,k ; h_0,h_1,...) is the k-th partition for h_1 through h_(j-1) corresponding to n=j-1 on page 831 of Abramowitz and Stegun (ordered as in A&S) with (h_0)^(j-m)=(h_0)^(n+1-m) appended to each partition subsumed under n and m of A&S.

%C A134264 From identification of the elements of the inversion with those on page 25 of the Ardila et al. link, the coefficients of the irregular table enumerate non-crossing partitions on [n]. - _Tom Copeland_, Oct 13 2014

%C A134264 Operating with d/d(1') = d/d(h_1) on the n-th partition polynomial Prt(n;h_0,h_1,..,h_n) in square brackets above associated with t^(n+1) generates n * Prt(n-1;h_0,h_1,..,h_(n-1)); therefore, the polynomials are an Appell sequence of polynomials in the indeterminate h_1 when h_0=1 (a special type of Sheffer sequence).
%C A134264 Consequently, umbrally, [Prt(.;1,x,h_2,..) + y]^n = Prt(n;1,x+y,h_2,..); that is, Sum_{k=0..n} binomial(n,k) * Prt(k;1,x,h_2,..) * y^(n-k) = Prt(n;1,x+y,h_2,..).
%C A134264 Or, e^(x*z) * exp[Prt(.;1,0,h_2,..) * z] = exp[Prt(.;1,x,h_2,..) * z]. Then with x = h_1 = -(1/2) * d^2[f(t)]/dt^2 evaluated at t=0, the formal Laplace transform from z to 1/t of this expression generates g(t), the comp. inverse of f(t), when h_0 = 1 = df(t)/dt eval. at t=0.
%C A134264 I.e., t / (1 - t*(x + Prt(.;1,0,h_2,..))) = t / (1 - t*Prt(.;1,x,h_2,..)) = g(t), interpreted umbrally, when h_0 = 1.

%C A134264 Connections to and between arrays associated to the Catalan (A000108 and A007317), Riordan (A005043), Fibonacci (A000045), and Fine (A000957) numbers and to lattice paths, e.g., the Motzkin, Dyck, and Łukasiewicz, can be made explicit by considering the inverse in x of the o.g.f. of A104597(x,-t), i.e., f(x) = P(Cinv(x),t-1) = Cinv(x) / (1 + (t-1)*Cinv(x)) = x*(1-x) / (1 + (t-1)*x*(1-x)) = (x-x^2) / (1 + (t-1)*(x-x^2)), where  Cinv(x) = x*(1-x) is the inverse of C(x) = (1 - sqrt(1-4*x)) / 2, a shifted o.g.f. for the Catalan numbers, and P(x,t) = x / (1+t*x) with inverse Pinv(x,t) = -P(-x,t) = x / (1-t*x). Then h(x,t) = x / f(x,t) = x * (1+(t-1)Cinv(x)) / Cinv(x) = 1 + t*x + x^2 + x^3 + ..., i.e., h_1=t and all other coefficients are 1, so the inverse of f(x,t) in x, which is explicitly in closed form finv(x,t) = C(Pinv(x,t-1)), is given by A091867, whose coefficients are sums of the refined Narayana numbers above obtained by setting h_1=(1')=t in the partition polynomials and all other coefficients to one. The group generators C(x) and P(x,t) and their inverses allow associations to be easily made between these classic number arrays. - _Tom Copeland_, Nov 03 2014

%C A134264 Inverting in x with t a parameter, let F(x;t,n) = x - t*x^(n+1). Then h(x) = x / F(x;t,n) = 1 / (1-t*x^n) = 1 + t*x^n + t^2*x^(2n) + t^3*x^(3n) + ..., so h_k vanishes unless k = m*n with m an integer in which case h_k = t^m.
%C A134264 Finv(x;t,n) = Sum_{j>=0} {binomial((n+1)*j,j) / (n*j + 1)} * t^j * x^(n*j + 1), which gives the Catalan numbers for n=1, and the Fuss-Catalan sequences for n>1 (see A001764, n=2). [Added braces to disambiguate the formula. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Oct 20 2015]
%C A134264 This relation reveals properties of the partitions and sums of the coefficients of the array. For n=1, h_k = t^k for all k, implying that the row sums are the Catalan numbers. For n = 2, h_k for k odd vanishes, implying that there are no blocks with only even-indexed h_k on the even-numbered rows and that only the blocks containing only even-sized bins contribute to the odd-row sums giving the Fuss-Catalan numbers for n=2. And so on, for n > 2.
%C A134264 These relations are reflected in any combinatorial structures enumerated by this array and the partitions, such as the noncrossing partitions depicted for a five-element set (a pentagon) in Wikipedia.

%C A134264 An Appell sequence possesses an umbral inverse sequence (cf. A249548). The partition polynomials here, Prt(n;1,h_1,...), are an Appell sequence in the indeterminate h_1=u, so have an e.g.f. exp[Prt(.;1,u,h_2...)*t] = e^(u*t) * exp[Prt(.;1,0,h2,...)*t] with umbral inverses with an e.g.f  e^(-u*t) / exp[Prt(.;1,0,h2,...)*t]. This makes contact with the formalism of A133314 (cf. also A049019 and A019538) and the signed, refined face partition polynomials of the permutahedra (or their duals), which determine the reciprocal of exp[Prt(.,0,u,h2...)*t] (cf. A249548) or exp[Prt(.;1,u,h2,...)*t], forming connections among the combinatorics of permutahedra and the noncrossing partitions, Dyck paths and trees (cf. A125181), and many other important structures isomorphic to the partitions of this entry, as well as to formal cumulants through A127671 and algebraic structures of Lie algebras. (Cf. relationship of permutahedra with the Eulerians A008292.)

%C A134264 The n-th row multiplied by n gives the number of terms in the homogeneous symmetric monomials generated by [x(1) + x(2) + ... + x(n+1)]^n under the umbral mapping x(m)^j = h_j, for any m. E.g., [a + b + c]^2 = [a^2 + b^2 + c^2] + 2 * [a*b + a*c + b*c] is mapped to [3 * h_2] + 2 * [3 * h_1^2], and 3 * A134264(3) = 3 *(1,1)= (3,3) the number of summands in the two homogeneous polynomials in the square brackets. For n=3, [a + b + c + d]^3 = [a^3 + b^3 + ...] + 3 [a*b^2 + a*c^2 + ...] + 6 [a*b*c + a*c*d + ...] maps to  [4 * h_3] + 3 [12 * h_1 * h_2] + 6 [4 * (h_1)^3], and the number of terms in the brackets is given by 4 * A134264(4) = 4 * (1,3,1) = (4,12,4).
%C A134264 The further reduced expression is 4 h_3 + 36 h_1 h_2 + 24 (h_1)^3 = A248120(4) with h_0 = 1. The general relation is n * A134264(n) = A248120(n) / A036038(n-1) where the arithmetic is performed on the coefficients of matching partitions in each row n.
%C A134264 Abramowitz and Stegun give combinatorial interpretations of A036038 and relations to other number arrays.
%C A134264 This can also be related to repeated umbral composition of Appell sequences and topology with the Bernoulli numbers playing a special role. See the Todd class link.

%C A134264 Speicher has examples of the first four inversion partition polynomials on pp. 22 and 23 with his k_n equivalent to h_n = (n') here with h_0 = 1. Identifying z = t, C(z) = t/f(t) = h(t), and M(z) = f^(-1)(t)/t, then statement (3), on p. 43, of Theorem 3.26, C(z M(z)) = M(z), is equivalent to substituting f^(-1)(t) for t in t/f(t), and statement (4), M(z/C(z)) = C(z), to substituting f(t) for t in f^(-1)(t)/t. - _Tom Copeland_, Dec 08 2021
%C A134264 Given a Laurent series of the form f(z) = 1/z + h_1 + h_2 z + h_3 z^2 + ..., the compositional inverse is f^(-1)(z) = 1/z + Prt(1;1,h_1)/z^2 + Prt(2;1,h_1,h_2)/z^3 + ... = 1/z + h_1/z^2 + (h_1^2 + h_2)/z^3 + (h_1^3 + 3 h_1 h_2 + h_3)/z^4 + (h_1^4 + 6 h_1^2 h_2 + 4 h_1 h_3 + 2 h_2^2 + h_4)/z^5 + ... for which the polynomials in the numerators are the partition polynomials of this entry. For example, this formula applied to the q-expansion of Klein's j-invariant / function with coefficients A000521, related to monstrous moonshine, gives the compositional inverse with the coefficients A091406 (see He and Jejjala). - _Tom Copeland_, Dec 18 2021

%F A134264 For j>1, there are P(j,m;a...) = j! / [ (j-m)! (a_1)! (a_2)! ... (a_(j-1))! ] permutations of h_0 through h_(j-1) in which h_0 is repeated (j-m) times; h_1, repeated a_1 times; and so on with a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_(j-1) = m.
%F A134264 If, in addition, a_1 + 2 * a_2 + ... + (j-1) * a_(j-1) = j-1, then each distinct combination of these arrangements is correlated with a partition of j-1.
%F A134264 T(j,k) is [ P(j,m;a...) / j ] for the k-th partition of j-1 as described in the comments.
%F A134264 For example from g(t) above, T(5,4) = (5! / ((5-3)! * 2!)) / 5 = 6 for the 4th partition under n=5-1=4 with m=3 parts in A&S.

%F A134264 Let W(x) = 1/(df(x)/dx)= 1/{d[x/h(x)]/dx}
%F A134264   = [(h_0)-1+:1/(1-h.*x):]^2 / {(h_0)-:[h.x/(1-h.x)]^2:}
%F A134264   = [(h_0)+(h_1)x+(h_2)x^2+...]^2 / [(h_0)-(h_2)x^2-2(h_3)x^3-3(h_4)x^4-...], where :" ": denotes umbral evaluation of the expression within the colons and h. is an umbral coefficient.
%F A134264 Then for the partition polynomials of A134264,
%F A134264   Poly[n;h_0,...,h_(n-1)]=(1/n!)(W(x)*d/dx)^n x, evaluated at x=0, and the compositional inverse of f(t) is g(t) = exp(t*W(x)*d/dx) x, evaluated at x=0. Also, dg(t)/dt = W(g(t)), and g(t) gives A001263 with (h_0)=u and (h_n)=1 for n>0 and A000108 with u=1.

%F A134264 R = t*W(d/dt) = t*((h_0) + (h_1)d/dt + (h_2)(d/dt)^2 + ...)^2 / ((h_0) - (h_2)(d/dt)^2 - 2(h_3)(d/dt)^3 - 3(h_4)(d/dt)^4 + ...),  and

%F A134264 Using the formalism of A263634, the raising operator for the partition polynomials of this array with h_0 = 1 begins as R = h_1 + h_2 D + h_3 D^2/2! + (h_4 - h_2^2) D^3/3! + (h_5 - 5 h_2 h_3) D^4/4! + (h_6 + 5 h_2^3 - 7 h_3^2 - 9 h_2 h_4) D^5/5! + (h_7 - 14 h_2 h_5 + 56 h_2^2 h_3) D^6/6! + ... with D = d/d(h_1). - _Tom Copeland_, Sep 09 2016
%F A134264 Let h(x) = x/f^{-1}(x) = 1/[1-(c_2*x+c_3*x^2+...)], with c_n all greater than zero. Then h_n are all greater than zero and h_0 = 1. Determine P_n(t) from exp[t*f^{-1}(x)] = exp[x*P.(t)] with f^{-1}(x) = x/h(x) expressed in terms of the h_n (cf. A133314 and A263633). Then P_n(b.) = 0 gives a recursion relation for the inversion polynomials of this entry a_n = b_n/n! in terms of the lower order inversion polynomials and P_j(b.)P_k(b.) = P_j(t)P_k(t)|_{t^n = b_n} = d_{j,k} >= 0 is the coefficient of x^j/j!*y^k/k! in the Taylor series expansion of the formal group law FGL(x,y) = f[f^{-1}(x)+f^{-1}(y)]. - _Tom Copeland_, Feb 09 2018
%F A134264 A raising operator for the partition polynomials with h_0 = 1 regarded as a Sheffer Appell sequence in h_1 is described in A249548. - _Tom Copeland_, Jul 03 2018
%e A134264 1) With f(t) = t / (t-1), then h(t) = -(1-t), giving h_0 = -1, h_1 = 1 and h_n = 0 for n>1. Then g(t) = -t - t^2 - t^3 - ... = t / (t-1).
%e A134264 2) With f(t) = t*(1-t), then h(t) = 1 / (1-t), giving h_n = 1 for all n. The compositional inverse of this f(t) is g(t) = t*A(t) where A(t) is the o.g.f. for the Catalan numbers; therefore the sum over k of T(j,k), i.e., the row sum, is the Catalan number A000108(j-1).
%e A134264 3) With f(t) = (e^(-a*t)-1) / (-a), h(t) = Sum_{n>=0} Bernoulli(n) * (-a*t)^n / n! and g(t) = log(1-a*t) / (-a) = Sum_{n>=1} a^(n-1) * t^n / n. Therefore with h_n = Bernoulli(n) * (-a)^n / n!, Sum_{permutations s with s(1)+s(2)+...+s(j)=j-1} h_s(1) * h_s(2) * ... * h_s(j) = j * Sum_{k=1..(# of partitions for j-1)} T(j,k) * H(j-1,k ; h_0,h_1,...) = a^(j-1). Note, in turn, Sum_{a=1..m} a^(j-1) = (Bernoulli(j,m+1) - Bernoulli(j)) / j for the Bernoulli polynomials and numbers, for j>1.
%e A134264 4) With f(t,x) = t / (x-1+1/(1-t)), then h(t,x) = x-1+1/(1-t), giving (h_0)=x and (h_n)=1 for n>1. Then g(t,x) = (1-(1-x)*t-sqrt(1-2*(1+x)*t+((x-1)*t)^2)) / 2, a shifted o.g.f. in t for the Narayana polynomials in x of A001263.
%e A134264 5) With h(t)= o.g.f. of A075834, but with A075834(1)=2 rather than 1, which is the o.g.f. for the number of connected positroids on [n] (cf. Ardila et al., p. 25), g(t) is the o.g.f. for A000522, which is the o.g.f. for the number of positroids on [n]. (Added Oct 13 2014 by author.)
%e A134264 6) With f(t,x) = x / ((1-t*x)*(1-(1+t)*x)), an o.g.f. for A074909, the reverse face polynomials of the simplices, h(t,x) = (1-t*x) * (1-(1+t)*x) with h_0=1, h_1=-(1+2*t), and h_2=t*(1+t), giving as the inverse in x about 0 the o.g.f. (1+(1+2*t)*x-sqrt(1+(1+2*t)*2*x+x^2)) / (2*t*(1+t)*x) for signed A033282, the reverse face polynomials of the Stasheff polytopes, or associahedra. Cf. A248727. (Added Jan 21 2015 by author.)
%e A134264 7) With f(x,t) = x / ((1+x)*(1+t*x)), an o.g.f. for the polynomials (-1)^n * (1 + t + ... + t^n), h(t,x) = (1+x) * (1+t*x) with h_0=1, h_1=(1+t), and h_2=t, giving as the inverse in x about 0 the o.g.f. (1-(1+t)*x-sqrt(1-2*(1+t)*x+((t-1)*x)^2)) / (2*x*t) for the Narayana polynomials A001263. Cf. A046802. (Added Jan 24 2015 by author.)
