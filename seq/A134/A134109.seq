%N A134109 Number of integral solutions with nonnegative y to Mordell's equation y^2 = x^3 - n.
%C A134109 a(n) = A081120(n)/2 if A081120(n) is even, (A081120(n)+1)/2 if A081120(n) is odd (i.e. if n is a cubic number).
%C A134109 In sequences A134108 and A134109 (this entry) dealing with the equation y^2 = x^3 + n, one could note that these are Mordell equations. Here are some related sequences: A054504, A081119, A081120, A081121. The link "Integer points on Mordell curves" has data on 20000 values of n. A134108 and A134109 count only solutions with y >= 0 and can be derived from A081119 and A081120. - _T. D. Noe_, Oct 12 2007

%e A134109 y^2 = x^3 - 4 has solutions (y, x) = (2, 2) and (11, 5), hence a(4) = 2.
%e A134109 y^2 = x^3 - 5 has no solutions, hence a(5) = 0.
%e A134109 y^2 = x^3 - 8 has solution (y, x) = (0, 2), hence a(8) = 1.
%e A134109 y^2 = x^3 - 207 has 7 solutions (see A134106, A134107), hence a(207) = 7.
