%N A134612 Nonprime numbers such that the root mean cube of their prime factors is a prime (where the root mean cube of c and d is ((c^3+d^3)/2)^(1/3)).
%C A134612 The prime factors are taken with multiplicity.
%C A134612 All perfect prime powers (A025475) with power > 1 are included. First term not included in A025475 is a(211) = 707265 = A134614(5) = A134615(1).
%C A134612 Originally, the first term was 1. This was wrong, since the cube mean of the prime factors of 1 is zero, by definition of the empty sum.

%e A134612 a(5) = 25, since 25 = 5*5 and ((5^3+5^3)/2)^(1/3) = 5.
