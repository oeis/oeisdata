%N A134627 Sum-fill array starting with (1,2).
%C A134627 The sequence represents the para-sequence in which the "final ordering" << is given by 1 << ... << 4 << 3 << 2.

%F A134627 Row n>=2 is produced from row n by the sum-fill operation, defined on an arbitrary infinite or finite sequence x = (x(1), x(2), x(3), ...) by the following two steps: Step 1. Form the sequence x(1), x(1)+x(2), x(2), x(2)+x(3), x(3), x(3)+x(4), ...; i.e., fill the space between x(n) and x(n+1) by their sum. Step 2. Delete duplicates; i.e., letting y be the sequence resulting from Step 1, if y(n+h)=y(n) for some h>=1, then delete y(n+h).
%e A134627 The initial row (1,2) begets (1,3,2) because 3 = 1+2.
%e A134627 Then (1,3,2) begets (1,4,3,5,2) by sum-filling, etc.
