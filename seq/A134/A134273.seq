%N A134273 A certain partition array in Abramowitz-Stegun order (A-St order), called M_3(5).
%C A134273 For the A-St order of partitions see the Abramowitz-Stegun reference given in A117506.
%C A134273 Partition number array M_3(5), the k=5 member in the family of a generalization of the multinomial number arrays M_3 = M_3(1) = A036040.
%C A134273 The sequence of row lengths is A000041 (partition numbers) [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 22, 30, 42, ...].
%C A134273 The S2(5,n,m):=A049029(n,m) numbers (generalized Stirling2 numbers) are obtained by summing in row n all numbers with the same part number m. In the same manner the S2(n,m) (Stirling2) numbers A008277 are obtained from the partition array M_3 = A036040.
%C A134273 a(n,k) enumerates unordered forests of increasing quintic (5-ary) trees related to the k-th partition of n in the A-St order. The m-forest is composed of m such trees, with m the number of parts of the partition.

Exponents 0 can be omitted due to 0!=1.

%Y A134273 Cf. There are a(4, 3)=75=3*5^2 unordered 2-forest with 4 vertices, composed of two 5-ary increasing trees, each with two vertices: there are 3 increasing labelings (1, 2)(3, 4); (1, 3)(2, 4); (1, 4)(2, 3) and each tree comes in five versions from the 5-ary structure.
%Y A134273 Cf. A049120 (row sums also of triangle A049029).
%Y A134273 Cf. A134149 (M_3(4) array).
