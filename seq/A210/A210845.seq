%N A210845 Values n for which A055034(n) is squarefree.
%C A210845 A055034(n) is the degree delta(n) of the minimal polynomial of the algebraic number rho(n):=2*cos(pi/n), n>=1, whose coefficients are shown in A187360. It is also the order of multiplicative abelian group Modd n (for multiplication Modd n see a comment on A203571). This is the Galois group Gal(Q(rho(n))/Q). If the number of abelian groups of order delta(n) is 1 then this group is necessarily cyclic.
%C A210845   Because A000688 is 1 exactly for the squarefree numbers A005117, the set of a(n) values of the present sequence is a (proper) subset of A206551. Hence it is immediately clear that the multiplicative group Modd a(n) is cyclic, but there are other cyclic Modd n groups, e.g., for n = 8, 10, 15, 16, 17, 19, 26, 27, 32, 34, 35, 37, 38, 39, 41,...
%F A210845 A055034(a(n)) is squarefree, i.e. from A005117.
%e A210845 a(3)=3 because delta(3)=A055034(3)= 1, and 1 is a member of the squarefree numbers A005117.
%e A210845 a(8)=9 because A055034(9)= 3 = A005117(3).
%e A210845 a(10)=13 because A055034(13)= 6 = A005117(5).
