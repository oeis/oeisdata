%N A210482 Prime numbers of the form (p#)^2 + 1, where p# is a primorial.
%C A210482 This sequence is the subset of primes in A189409.
%C A210482 The sequence A189409 is an extension of Euclid's second theorem about generating infinitely many prime numbers.
%C A210482 The motivation for this sequence is Euclid's second theorem or infinitude of primes theorem. Per this theorem, N = (2*3*5..p) + 1 generates the i-th Euclid number. p = p_i is the i-th prime. This Euclid number is either a prime or product of primes with one of the prime factors greater than p_i.
%C A210482 This is generated as a product of the squares of the first N prime numbers and adding 1 to it. M = ((2*2)*(3*3)*(5*5)*...*(p*p)) + 1. a(8) is a possible prime of 1328 digits.
%C A210482 The next term is about 2.519... * 10^1327. - _Amiram Eldar_, Nov 23 2018
%F A210482 Intersection of A000040 and A189409.
%F A210482 a(n) = A189409(A092061(n)). - _Amiram Eldar_, Nov 23 2018
%e A210482 2, 5 and 37 of A189409 are primes and in the sequence.
%e A210482 But 901=17*53, the next term of A189409, is not a prime and not in the sequence.
