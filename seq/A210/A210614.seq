%N A210614 Numbers without digit 0 or 5 whose "waterfall sequence" ends in 0,0,0,...
%C A210614 The "waterfall" sequence S for a given starting value S(1) is defined as S(n)=d(n-1)*d(n) (n>1), where d(n) is the n-th digit of the sequence.
%C A210614 When a(0) has a digit 0 or 5, then S is likely to end up in repeating zeros, which is the motivation for the definition of this sequence.

%e A210614 The waterfall sequence for S(1)=69 is S=(69,54,45,20,16,20,10,0,0,6,12, 0,0,0,0,0,0,6,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,...) with S(2)=6*9=54, S(3)=9*5=45, S(4)=5*4=20, etc.
%e A210614 The last "2" is obtained as 1*2 from the digits of term S(27)=12, thereafter there are no two consecutive nonzero digits and therefore only 0's can follow.
%e A210614 Similarly, for S(1)=78, one has S=(78,56,40,30,24,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,...), and only zeros thereafter since d(10)=4 is the last nonzero digit having a nonzero neighboring digit (d(9)=2, which yields S(10)=2*4=8).
