%N A175280 Base-9 pandigital primes: primes having at least one of each digit 0,...,8 when written in base 9.
%C A175280 Terms in this sequence have at least 10 digits in base 9, i.e., are larger than 9^9, since sum(d_i 9^i) = sum(d_i) (mod 8), and 0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8 is divisible by 4. So there must be at least one repeated digit, which may not be even, else the resulting number is even. The smallest terms are therefore of the form "10123...." in base 9, where "...." is a permutation of "45678", cf. examples.
