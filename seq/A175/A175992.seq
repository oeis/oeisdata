%N A175992 Triangle T(n,k) read by rows. If n=k then 0, else if k divides n then 1 else 0.
%C A175992 Obtained by replacing the elements on the diagonal of A051731 by zero.
%C A175992 Apart from the initial T(1,1), the same as A176890.
%C A175992 The inverse of A051731 can be calculated with matrix powers of this matrix T(n,k) as follows: T(n,k)^0-T(n,k)^1+T(n,k)^2-T(n,k)^3+T(n,k)^4 ... Compare this to the binomial series for (1+x)^-1=1-x+x^2-x^3+x^4...
%F A175992 T(n,n) = 0. T(n,k) = 1 if k|n and k<n. T(n,k) = 0 if k does not divide n and k<n.
%F A175992 Lim_{s -> Infinity} T(n,k) where Ts(n,k) is the table defined by the recurrence:
%F A175992 Ts(n,k)=if k=1 then zeta[s]*(1-1/n^(s-1))-Sum_{i=1..n-1} Ts(n,k+i)/(i+1)^(s-1) else if k divides n then Ts(n/k,1) else Ts(n,k)=0 else Ts(n,k)=0. - _Mats Granvik_, Apr 09 2016
