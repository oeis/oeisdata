%N A175881 Number of closed Knight's tours on a 6 X n board.
%C A175881 Could you please say how you calculated these numbers? - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Dec 05 2010?
%C A175881 I kept track of pairs of loose ends within the two rightmost columns of a 6 X n board, assuming that everything to the left of these two columns is fully connected and that there are no cycles (or one if this is a final state). Next I added a new column and connected it to the rightmost two columns in all ways such that there are no cycles formed(or one if this results in a final state) and the leftmost column in the current state is fully connected and can be dropped. From this followed a transition matrix. I can provide a reference to my writeup once it is completed and has been accepted by my supervisor. - _Johan de Ruiter_, Dec 05 2010
