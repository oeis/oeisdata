%N A175907 Known friendly squarefree numbers.
%C A175907 From _Walter Nissen_, May 28 2011: (Start)
%C A175907 As with most aspects of friendly and solitary numbers, this sequence is not known to be complete. A friend could possibly be found for 10, for example; same doubtful status as an odd perfect number.
%C A175907 Note that not all friendly numbers will be found among the primitive friendly numbers listed in link "Primitive Friendly Pairs", and this would be true even if those were not limited to small examples.
%C A175907 Other terms are 1330, 1995, and 49166.

%e A175907 6, being 2 * 3, is squarefree. Having abundancy = 2, 6 is friendly with all the other perfect numbers. Ergo, it is in the sequence. ( 1 ), 2, 3, and 5, being prime powers, are solitary. 4 is a square. Ergo, a(1) is 6.
