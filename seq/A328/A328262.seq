%N A328262 a(n) = a(n-1)*3/2, if noninteger then rounded to the nearest even integer, with a(1) = 1.
%C A328262 On average, about one out of every three numbers will have been rounded, since after each rounding there is a 1 in 1 chance of the next number being divisible by 2, 1 in 2 of being divisible by 2^2, and so on, leading to an average of the number after a rounding being divisible by 2^2, requiring three terms (including itself) to reach a point where it needs to round again. There doesn't seem to be any pattern to whether the roundings are up or down, and they seem to each be equally likely.
%C A328262 Because the Mathematica function "Round" always rounds x.5 to the nearest even integer to x, the second Mathematica program below is very simple. - _Harvey P. Dale_, Jul 22 2025
