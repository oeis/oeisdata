%N A328244 Numbers whose second arithmetic derivative (A068346) is a squarefree number (A005117).
%C A328244 Numbers n for which A008966(A003415(A003415(n))) = 1.
%C A328244 Numbers whose first, second or third arithmetic derivative is prime (A157037, A192192, A328239) are all included in this sequence, because: (1) taking arithmetic derivative of a prime gives 1, which is squarefree, (2) primes themselves are squarefree, and (3) only squarefree numbers may have arithmetic derivative that is a prime.

%e A328244 For n=6, its first arithmetic derivative is A003415(6) = 5, and its second derivative is A003415(5) = 1, and 1 is a squarefree number (in A005117), thus 6 is included in this sequence.
%e A328244 For n=9, A003415(9) = 6, A003415(6) = 5, and 5, like all prime numbers, is squarefree, thus 9 is included in this sequence.
%e A328244 For n=14, A003415(14) = 9, A003415(9) = 6 = 2*3, and as 6 is squarefree, 14 is included in this sequence.
