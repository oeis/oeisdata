%N A328770 Numbers in whose primorial base expansion any digit is at most half of the maximal allowed digit for that position.
%C A328770 Equally, numbers in whose primorial base expansion there are no digits more than ((prime(k)-1)/2), where prime(k) is the modulus for the digit position k = 1 + maximal allowed digit for that position.
%C A328770 Differs from A276154, for example, this sequence does not contain term 120.

%F A328770 a(n) = A328849(n)/2.
%F A328770 Because doubling these numbers in primorial base does not generate any carries, it follows that:
%F A328770 A276086(a(n)+a(n)) = A276086(a(n)) * A276086(a(n)) = A328834(n)^2.
%e A328770 2 is included, as in the primorial base (A049345) it is written as "10", thus 2 is included in the sequence as the maximal value that can occur in the second rightmost digit (in the primorial base representation) is 2 (as in "20" = 4 or "21" = 5 for example).
%o A328770 (PARI) isA328770(n) = { my(p=2); while(n, if((n%p)>((p-1)/2), return(0)); n = n\p; p = nextprime(1+p)); (1); };
%Y A328770 Subsequence of A276154 (because of Bertrand's postulate).
