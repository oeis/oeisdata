%N A328216 Weak-Fibonacci-Niven numbers: numbers divisible by the number of terms in at least one representation as a sum of distinct Fibonacci numbers.
%C A328216 The Fibonacci numbers F(1) = F(2) = 1 can be used at most once in the representation.
%C A328216 Grundman proved that there are infinitely many runs of 6 consecutive weak-Fibonacci-Niven numbers by showing that if m = F(240k) + F(14) + F(9) for k >= 1, then m, m+1, ... m+5 are 6 consecutive weak-Fibonacci-Niven numbers.

%e A328216 6 is in the sequence since it can be represented as the sum of 2 Fibonacci numbers, 1 + 5, and 2 is a divisor of 6.
