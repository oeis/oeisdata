%N A328378 Number of permutations of length n that possess the maximal sum of distances between contiguous elements.
%C A328378 From _Andrew Howroyd_, Oct 16 2019: (Start)
%C A328378 No permutation with maximal sum of distances between contiguous elements can contain three contiguous elements a, b, c such that a < b < c or a > b > c. Otherwise removing b will not alter the sum and then appending b to the end of the permutation will increase it so that the original permutation could not have been maximal. In this sense all solution permutations are alternating.
%C A328378 For odd n consider an alternating permutation of the form p_1 p_2 ... p_n with p_1 > p2, p_2 < p_3, etc. The sum of distances is given by (p_1 + 2*p_3 + 2*p_5 + ... 2*p_{n-2} + p_n) - 2*(p_2 + p_4 + ... p_{n-1}). This is maximized by choosing the central odd p_i to be as highest possible and the even p_i to be least possible but other than that the order does not alter the sum. Similar arguments can be made for p_1 < p_2 and for the case when n is even.
%C A328378 The above considerations lead to a formula for this sequence with the maximum sum being given by A047838(n). (End)
