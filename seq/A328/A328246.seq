%e A328246 For n=9, its first arithmetic derivative is A003415(9) = 6, its second derivative is A003415(6) = 5, and its third derivative is A003415(5) = 1, and 1 is a squarefree number (in A005117), thus 9 is included in this sequence.
%e A328246 For n=14, A003415(14) = 9, A003415(9) = 6, A003415(6) = 5, and 5, like all primes, is a squarefree number, thus 14 is included in this sequence.
%e A328246 For n=49, A003415(49) = 14, A003415(14) = 9, A003415(9) = 6 = 2*3, and 6 is a squarefree number, thus 49 is included in this sequence.
