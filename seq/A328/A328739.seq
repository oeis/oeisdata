%N A328739 Table of A(n,k) read by antidiagonals, where A(n,1)=2, and every n+1 consecutive terms in row n are pairwise coprime. Terms are chosen to be the least increasing value compatible with these constraints.
%C A328739 This algorithm acts as a prime number sieve. Prime numbers move to the left with each step. The second diagonal (and all the numbers to the left) are all primes.
%C A328739 The first composite number in each row: 4, 8, 8, 16, 16, 24, 24, 32, 32, 32, 45, 48, 48, 54, 64, 64, 64, 72, 80, 81, 90, 96, 105, 108, 108, 120, 128, 128, 128, ....
%C A328739 In this sieve, some numbers disappear and then reappear. For example, 26 disappears on the third row, then reappears on the 4th and 5th rows, then disappears again.
%F A328739 A(n, k) = prime(k) if k <= n+1. - _M. F. Hasler_, May 09 2025
