%N A328589 Numbers n that are multiples of 6 and for which A257993(A276086(A276086(n))) is larger than A257993(n), where A276086 converts the primorial base expansion of n into its prime product form, and A257993 returns the index of the least prime not present in its argument.
%C A328589 Multiples of six such that the least nondivisor prime of the original n is less than the least nondivisor prime of the number obtained after two iterations of A276086 is.
%C A328589 All terms are multiples of 5 (and thus of 30), because when applied to any number which is a multiple of 6, but not of 5 (and thus not a multiple of 30, so the primorial expansion ends with "x00", where x <> 0, and A257993(n) = 3), A276086 will yield a number of the form 30k+5 or 30k+25 (A084967) whose primorial expansion ends either as "...021" or as "...401" (with the least significant zero either in position 2 or 3), thus then A328578(n) = A257993(A276086(A276086(n))) is definitely not larger than 3, while A257993(6k) >= 3 for all k >= 1.
