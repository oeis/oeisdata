%N A328321 Numbers n for which A328311(n) = 1 + A051903(A003415(n)) - A051903(n) is strictly positive.
%C A328321 Numbers n for which A051903(A003415(n)) >= A051903(n), i.e., numbers such that taking their arithmetic derivative does not decrease their "degree", A051903, the maximal exponent in prime factorization.

%e A328321 10 = 2*5 has maximal exponent (A051903) 1, and its arithmetic derivative A003415(10) = 2+5 = 7 also has maximal exponent 1, thus 10 is included in this sequence.
%e A328321 15 = 3*5 has maximal exponent 1, and its arithmetic derivative A003415(15) = 3+5 = 8 = 2^3 has maximal exponent 3, thus 15 is included in this sequence.
%e A328321 For 8 = 2^3, its arithmetic derivative A003415(8) = 12 = 2^2 * 3, and as 2 < 3 (highest exponent of 12 is less than that of 8), 8 is NOT included here, and from this we also see that A100716 is not a subsequence of this sequence.
