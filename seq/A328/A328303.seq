%e A328303 Arithmetic derivative of 1 is A003415(1) = 0, which is not a squarefree number (not in A005117), thus 1 is included in this sequence. Ditto for 0, as A003415(0) = 0.
%e A328303 Arithmetic derivative of 8 is A003415(8) = 12 = 2^2 * 3, which is not squarefree, thus 8 is included in this sequence.
%e A328303 Arithmetic derivative of 15 is A003415(15) = 8 = 2^3, which is not squarefree, thus 15 is included in this sequence.
