%N A328930 Numbers N such that A328919(N) < A051903(N); numbers N such that {sigma_k(N) mod N: k >= m} is purely periodic with some m < e, where e is the maximal exponent in prime factorization of N.
%C A328930 It is easy to see that {sigma_k(N) mod N: k >= A051903(N)} is purely periodic.
%C A328930 All terms are nonsquarefree: if N is squarefree and N is here, then A328919(N) < A051903(N) = 1, so A328919(N) = 0. By the property mentioned in A328919, a necessary condition is that for every prime p dividing N, write N = p*s, we have p divides d(s), d = A000005. But d(s) is a power of 2, so N = 2, and 2 is not here.
%C A328930 Although it seems that for most N we have A328919(N) = A051903(N), this sequence is infinite. See A328934 for more information.
%e A328930 A328919(12) = 0, while A051903(12) = 2, so 12 is a term.
%e A328930 A328919(24) = 1, while A051903(24) = 3, so 24 is a term.
%e A328930 If N = p^e for prime p, then A328919(p^e) = A051903(p^e) = e. So this sequence and A000961 have empty intersection.
