%N A051252 Number of essentially different ways of arranging numbers 1 through 2n around a circle so that sum of each pair of adjacent numbers is prime.
%C A051252 _Jud McCranie_ reports that he was able to find a solution for each n <= 225 (2n <= 450) in just a few seconds. - Jul 05 2002
%C A051252 Is there a proof that this can always be done?
%C A051252 The Mathematica program for this sequence uses backtracking to find all solutions for a given n. To verify that at least one solution exists for a given n, the backtracking function be made to stop when the first solution is found. Solutions have been found for n <= 48. - _T. D. Noe_, Jun 19 2002
%C A051252 This sequence is from the prime circle problem. There is no known proof that a(n) > 0 for all n. However, for many n (see A072618 and A072676), we can prove that a(n) > 0. Also, the sequence A072616 seems to imply that there are always solutions in which the odd (or even) numbers are in order around the circle. - _T. D. Noe_, Jul 01 2002
%C A051252 Prime circles can apparently be generated for any n using the Mathematica programs given in A072676 and A072184. - _T. D. Noe_, Jul 08 2002
%C A051252 The following seems to always produce a solution: Work around the circle starting with 1 but after that always choosing the largest remaining number that fits. For example, if n = 4 this gives 1, 6, 7, 4, 3, 8, 5, 2. See A088643 for a sequence on a related idea. - _Paul Boddington_, Oct 30 2007
%C A051252 See A228917 for a similar conjecture on twin primes. - _Zhi-Wei Sun_, Sep 08 2013
%C A051252 See A242527 for a similar problem on the set of numbers {0 through (n-1)}. - _Stanislav Sykora_, May 30 2014
%C A051252 James Tilley and Stan Wagon report that all terms up to n = 10^6 are nonzero. _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Feb 05 2016
