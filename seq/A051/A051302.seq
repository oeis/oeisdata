%N A051302 Numbers whose square can be expressed as the sum of two positive cubes in more than one way.
%C A051302 Observations regarding terms through a(64)=306761364: All are multiples of 7^2, 13^2, and/or 19^2. Other than 2, 3, 5 and 11, their only prime factors are 7, 13, 19, 31, 43, 61, 67, 79, 127, 151, and 181 (each of which exceeds a multiple of 6 by 1). None is a cube or higher power; the ones that are squares are a(7), a(12), a(17), a(19), a(20), a(32), a(33), a(41), a(49), a(55), and a(58). - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Oct 08 2006
%C A051302 Many of the terms beyond a(64) have prime factors other than those found in a(1) through a(64); however, each term through a(774) has at most one distinct prime factor p > 5 that does not exceed a multiple of 6 by 1, and p, if such a prime factor exists, has a multiplicity m=3, with only a few exceptions: n=651 and n=713 (where p^m is 11^2), n=346 and n=770 (where p^m is 17^2), n=699 and n=740 (where p^m is 23^2), and n=741 (where p^m is 11^6). - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Oct 20 2013
%C A051302 First differs from A145553 at A051302(172)=3343221000 where 3343221000^2 = 279300^3 + 2234400^3 = 790020^3 + 2202480^3 = 1256850^3 + 2094750^3.
%C A051302 This sequence is the union of A145553 and A155961.
%C A051302 This sequence is infinite. If n is a member of this sequence, then n^2 = a^3 + b^3 = c^3 + d^3 where (a, b) and (c, d) are distinct pairs. If n^2 = a^3 + b^3 = c^3 + d^3, then (n*k^3)^2 = n^2*k^6 = k^6*(a^3 + b^3) = k^6*(c^3 + d^3) = (a*k^2)^3 + (b*k^2)^3 = (c*k^2)^3 + (d*k^2)^3. It is obvious that if (a, b) and (c, d) are distinct, then (k^2*a, k^2*b), (k^2*c, k^2*d) are also distinct for all nonzero values of k. So if n is in this sequence, then n*k^3 is in this sequence for all k > 0. - _Altug Alkan_, May 10 2016

%e A051302 2989441^2 = 1729^3+20748^3 = 15561^3+17290^3, so 2989441 is in the sequence.
