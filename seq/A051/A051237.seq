%N A051237 Lexicographically earliest prime pyramid, read by rows.
%C A051237 Row n begins with 1, ends with n and sum of any two adjacent entries is prime.
%C A051237 From _Daniel Forgues_, May 17 2011 and May 18 2011: (Start)
%C A051237 Since the sum of any two adjacent entries is at least 3, the sum is an odd prime, which implies that any two consecutive entries have opposite parity.
%C A051237 Since the first and last entries of row n are fixed at 1 and n, we have to find n-2 entries, where ceiling((n-2)/2) of them are even and floor((n-2)/2) are odd, so for row n the number of possible arrangements is
%C A051237   (ceiling((n-2)/2))! * (floor((n-2)/2))! (Cf. A010551(n-2), n >= 2.)
%C A051237 The number of ways of arranging row n to get a prime pyramid is given by A036440. List them in lexicographic order and pick the first (earliest) to get row n of lexicographically earliest prime pyramid.
%C A051237 Prime pyramids are also (more fittingly?) called prime triangles. (End)
%C A051237 It appears that the limit of the rows of the lexicographically earliest prime pyramid is A055265 (see comment in that sequence).
%C A051237 Assuming Dickson's conjecture (or the later Hardy-Littlewood Conjecture B), no backtracking is needed: if the first n-2 elements in each row are chosen greedily, a penultimate member can be chosen such that its sums are prime. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, May 18 2011
