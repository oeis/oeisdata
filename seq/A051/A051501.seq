%N A051501 Bertrand primes III: a(n+1) is the smallest prime > 2^a(n).
%C A051501 The terms in the sequence are floor(2^b), floor(2^2^b), floor(2^2^2^b), ..., where b is approximately 1.2516475977905.
%C A051501 The existence of b is a consequence of Bertrand's postulate.
%C A051501 a(5) is much larger than the largest known prime, which is currently only 2^32582657-1. - _T. D. Noe_, Oct 18 2007
%C A051501 This sequence is of course not computed from b; rather b is more precisely computed by determining the next term in the sequence.
%C A051501 Robert Ballie comments that the next term is known to be 2.80248435135615213561103452115581... * 10^41373247570 via Dusart 2016, improving on my 2010 result in the Extensions section. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Aug 11 2020

%E A051501 Although the exact value of the next term is not known, it has 41373247571 digits.
%E A051501 Next term is 2.8024843513561521356110...e41373247570, where the next digit is 3 or 4. Under the Riemann hypothesis, the first 20686623775 digits are known. [From _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Oct 27 2010]
