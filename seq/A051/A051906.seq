%N A051906 Number of ways of placing n nonattacking queens on an n X n toroidal chessboard.
%C A051906 The sequence has been computed up to n = 23 by Rivin, Vardi & Zimmermann, see p. 637 of their paper from 1994. Further terms were calculated by the submitter, Dec 17 1999 and Jan 11 2001.
%C A051906 a(n) is divisible by n.
%C A051906 Only terms indexed by odd numbers coprime to 3 are nonzero, therefore A007705(n) = a(2n+1) is the main entry. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jul 01 2019
