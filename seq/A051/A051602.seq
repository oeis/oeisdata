%N A051602 a(n) is the maximal number of squares that can be formed from n points in the plane.
%C A051602 _Sascha Kurz_ has proved that one can assume that the points belong to the square grid Z X Z.
%C A051602 So we obtain the same values if we replace the definition by: a(n) is the maximal number of squares that can be formed from n points chosen from the infinite square grid.
%C A051602 In other words, take the infinite square grid. Pick a set S of n grid points, and let c(S) be the number of subsets of four points of S that form a square of any (nonzero) size. Then a(n) = maximum of c(S) over all choices of S.
%C A051602 The general problem of estimating the maximal number of similar figures within point-configurations was studied in [Elekes--Erdos]. References can be found in [Matousek, p. 47] and [AFKK]. Note that the present problem concerning squares shares several properties with the case of right isosceles triangles treated in [AFR].
%C A051602 The following remarks are out of date, and will be revised soon to reflect progress made in October 2021 by a number of members of the Sequence Fans Mailing List.
%C A051602 A more detailed account will be found in the report by Sascha Kurz et al. which is nearing completion.
%C A051602 [Comments revised to this point by _N. J. A. Sloane_, Nov 02 2021]
%C A051602 Values for n <= 9 [now 16] are exact and are the same for a and b (see proofs below by Hugo van der Sanden and Benoît Jubin for n <= 7 and Sascha Kurz for n <= 9, which furthermore classify all optimal configurations for these values). Values for n > 9 are conjectural since they were obtained by exhaustive search for grid points within a square of side ceil(sqrt(n)), which is a reasonable assumption. A proof that optimal configurations (with gcd of side lengths equal to 1) have a diameter at most f(n) with f of moderate growth would permit exact computation of values from exhaustive searches.
%C A051602 Asymptotic behavior:
%C A051602 One has a(n), b(n) = Theta(n^2):
%C A051602 Upper bound: Since two vertices determine squares, one has b(n) = O(n^2). More explicitly: a pair of points uniquely determines the square that has it as diagonal, and a square has two diagonals, so b(n) <= n(n-1)/4 ~ n^2/4.
%C A051602 Lower bound: When n = m^2, the set of all grid points in [0, m-1]^2 yields S = n(n-1)/12 squares. Indeed, for a in [0, m-1] and b in [1, m], the square formed on (a,0) and (0,b) (as its "lower-left side") has other vertices (a+b,b) and (a,a+b), so there are (m-(a+b))^2 translates of that square. Therefore, S = Sum_{a=0..m-1} Sum_{b=1..m} (m - (a + b))^2. By change of summation indices ((a,c) := (a,a+b)), expanding, using the sum of the first m integers, squares, cubes, and refactoring, one obtains S = n(n-1)/12. Since a is nondecreasing, one has a(n) >= (n-1)(n-2)/12 ~ n^2/12.
%C A051602 We actually have better lower and upper bounds:
%C A051602 0.09... = (1-2/Pi)/4 <= liminf a(n)/n^2 <= limsup b(n)/n^2 <= 1/6 = 0.16...
%C A051602 The upper bound is given in [AFR] (which counts isosceles right triangles, so their value has to be divided by four, the number of isosceles right triangles formed on a square). This gives b(n) <= (2/3*(n - 1)^2 - 5/3)/4.
%C A051602 Lower bound (due to Peter Munn, see SeqFan post in the links): For r >= 0, denote by D(r) the disc centered at the origin with radius r. If A is a point on the boundary of D(r), then the set of points B such that the square with diagonal AB is included in D(r) is a lens-shaped region of area (Pi-2)r^2 (as a proportion of the disc area, this is twice A258146). Therefore, the number S of grid-squares included in D(R) can be estimated as follows: since the set of squares with at least two vertices equidistant from the origin is negligible, we can assume that every square has a unique vertex furthest from the origin, say at distance r, which corresponds to the A above. Then the opposite vertex B is in the region computed above, and the L^1 (aka rectilinear, or Manhattan) distance between A and B is even (being opposite vertices, they are two sides apart), so we have to divide that area by 2. There are approximately 2*Pi*r grid points at a distance approximately r from the origin, so at first order, S ~= Integral_{r=0..R} Pi*r(Pi - 2)r^2 dr = Pi(Pi-2)/4 R^4. Since the disc D(R) contains approximately Pi*R^2 points, one obtains S ~= (1-2/Pi)/4 n^2.
%C A051602 Conjecture: the asymptotic density of the numbers n such that there is no maximal arrangement formed by all the grid points within a suitably chosen circle, is 0. - _Peter Munn_, Sep 30 2021
%C A051602 For the known values of a(n) (n <= 17), there is a maximal arrangement formed using circles as specified by the conjecture above. For n <= 100 no arrangement has yet been found to contain more squares than the best attained using a circle as specified by A348469. - _Peter Munn_, Nov 12 2021
