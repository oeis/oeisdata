%N A388849 Number of polynomials P in the set S such that P(1)=n, where S is defined by: (i) 1 is in S; (ii) P is in S implies 1+x*P is in S; (iii) P is in S and Q is in S implies P*Q is in S.
%C A388849 If the repeated application of (i), (ii), (iii) fails to prove that P is in S, then P is not in S.
%C A388849 For n=1..17, a(n) = A130841(n), but a(18) = 30 != A130841(18) = 31. The gap further increases onward. The reason for the difference for the 18-th term is: (1+x)*(1+x*(1+x)*(1+x+x^2+x^3)) = (1+x+x^2)*(1+x*(1+x*(1+x)*(1+x))). Two ways of applying the rules can produce the same polynomial. The substitution x=1 and the erasure of all the "1*" 's provides the corresponding counted expressions in A130841: (1+1)*(1+(1+1)*(1+1+1+1)) and (1+1+1)*(1+1+(1+1)*(1+1)), which are considered distinct.
%C A388849 If P(1)=k, then 1+P(1)=k+1. If P(1)=k and Q(1)=j, then (P*Q)(1)=k*j. These two rules allow for incremental computation of a(n) from previously computed sets of polynomials, see Linked Java and Prolog. - _Sean A. Irvine_, Oct 24 2025

%e A388849 By applying (i), 1 is in S.
%e A388849 By applying (ii) to 1, 1+x*1 = 1+x is in S.
%e A388849 By applying (ii) to 1+x, 1+x*(1+x) = 1+x+x^2 is in S.
%e A388849 By applying (ii) to 1+x+x^2, 1+x*(1+x+x^2) = 1+x+x^2+x^3 is in S.
%e A388849 By applying (iii) to 1+x and 1+x, (1+x)*(1+x) = 1+2x+x^2 is in S.
%e A388849 Evaluated at 1, the above polynomials yield respectively 1, 2, 3, 4, 4; that proves that a(1)>=1, a(2)>=1, a(3)>=1 and a(4)>=2.
%e A388849 Actually, the equalities a(1)=1, a(2)=1, a(3)=1 and a(4)=2 hold: because rules (ii) and (iii) strictly increase the evaluations at 1, it is possible to use algorithms that exhaust the search for polynomials P with a given P(1) and they tell that the polynomials listed above are the only ones that evaluate to 1, 2, 3 or 4 at 1.
