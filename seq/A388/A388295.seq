%N A388295 a(n) is the least possible difference between the areas of the largest and smallest rectangles in a 4 element set of distinct integer sided rectangles filling an n X n square.
%C A388295 Let the difference between the largest and smallest areas of the rectangles be called the defect. Then a(n) is the minimum defect.
%e A388295 For n = 4, there are three sets of rectangles:
%e A388295   {(1 X 1), (1 X 3), (1 X 4), (2 X 4)} with defect = 8 - 1 = 7,
%e A388295   {(1 X 1), (1 X 2), (1 X 4), (3 X 3)} with defect = 9 - 1 = 8,
%e A388295   {(1 X 2), (1 X 4), (2 X 2), (2 X 3)} with defect = 6 - 2 = 4.
%e A388295 Therefore, a(4) = 4 since this is the minimum defect.
