%N A309981 a(n) is the smallest number k such that the value of n can be deduced given only the values tau(n), tau(n+1), ..., tau(n+k), where tau is the number of divisors function.
%C A309981 For every number n in 2..87, there exists at least one other number m in 2..72970801 such that tau(m+j) = tau(n+j) for each nonnegative j less than the listed term, which establishes a lower bound for the term. (For the smallest such m corresponding to each term in the Data, see the Links.) That each value listed in the Data is the exact value was proved using a variety of methods such as those in the Example section and some of the methods in the _R. J. Mathar_ link at A161460.
%C A309981 From _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Sep 23 2019: (Start)
%C A309981 It follows from the definition of this sequence that a(n) >= a(n-1) - 1, which provides an easy lower bound on a(n) (given a(n-1)). An easy (but weak) upper bound is provided by a(n) <= (ceiling(sqrt(n))+1)^2 - n, since any counterexample would mean that there exists a number n for which a list of the tau values of all the consecutive integers from n through (ceiling(sqrt(n))+1)^2 would not be sufficient to allow the deduction of the identity of n, even though those consecutive integers would include at least two consecutive squares (immediately identifiable as squares by their odd tau values), and the only pair of consecutive squares with difference d is (floor(d/2)^2, ceiling(d/2)^2).
%C A309981 For the indices at which the values 0..17 first appear in this sequence, see A327265.

%F A309981 a(1)=0; for n > 1, a(n) = 1 iff n is a term of A161460.
%e A309981 a(1)=0 only for n=1, the only number that has only 1 divisor.
%e A309981 a(2)=1: n=2 is the only prime such that n+1 is also prime.
%e A309981 a(3)=1: n=3 is the only prime such that n+1 is the square of a prime (i.e., n+1 has 3 divisors).
%e A309981 a(4)=1: n=4 is the only square of a prime such that n+1 is a prime. (For all other n = p^2 with p prime, n+1 is an even composite.)
%e A309981 a(5)=2: the numbers tau(n) and tau(n+1) are 2 and 4, respectively, for n = 5, 7, 13, 37, 61, ..., but 5 is the only number n such that (tau(n), tau(n+1), tau(n+2)) = (2,4,2).
%e A309981 a(49)=2: (tau(n), tau(n+1)) = (3,6) for n = 49, 1681, and only two other known values (i.e., for squares of terms > 3 in A086397), but (tau(n), tau(n+1), tau(n+2)) = (3,6,4) only for n = 49 (which is the only square of a prime p such that both sqrt((p^2 + 1)/2) and (p^2 + 2)/3 are also prime).
