%N A309195 a(n) = smallest number missing from A111273 after A111273(n) has been found.
%C A309195 A111273(n) can be even only if the triangular number T_n is even, that is when n is congruent to 0 or 3 modulo 4. So, as A111273(4) is not even, for n >= 4 there is an even number k <= n that has not appeared in A111273 by term n, whereas all odd numbers k <= n have appeared (as explained in A111273). Thus a(n) is even for all n. Also a(n) > n/2 for all n >= 1. - _Peter Munn_, Jul 27 2019
