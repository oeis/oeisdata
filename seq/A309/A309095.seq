%N A309095 a(n) is the largest k such that every number from 1 to k can be covered by n geometric progressions of rational numbers.
%C A309095 Each term in a geometric progression must be an integer, but the ratio between two consecutive terms can be a rational number. This means that geometric progressions like (9,15,25) are allowed.
%C A309095 The difference between consecutive terms is at least 2, because we can always cover 2 extra numbers with a single geometric progression.
%C A309095 The original problem discussed in the links gives a(36) >= 100. In fact one cannot cover {1,2,...,101} with 36 geometric progressions, so a(36) = 100.
%C A309095 {1,2,...,1000} can be covered with 362 geometric progressions, so a(362) >= 1000.
%C A309095 {1,2,...,10000} can be covered with 3620 geometric progressions, so a(3620) >= 10000.
%C A309095 It seems that a(n) is approximately n*e.
%C A309095 Finding the smallest n for a given k is a set covering problem with a binary variable for each geometric progression and a constraint for each number from 1 to k. - _Rob Pratt_, Jul 23 2019

%e A309095 1 to 2 can be covered with 1 geometric progression: (1,2). So a(1) = 2. Note that we cannot cover 1 to 3 with 1 geometric progression.
%e A309095 1 to 5 can be covered with 2 geometric progressions: (1,2,4) and (3,5). So a(2) = 5. Note that we cannot cover 1 to 6 with 2 geometric progressions.
%e A309095 1 to 8 can be covered with 3 geometric progressions: (1,2,4,8), (3,5), (6,7). So a(3) = 8.
%e A309095 1 to 10 can be covered with 4 geometric progressions: (1,2,4,8), (1,3,9), (5,6), (7,10). So a(4) = 10.
%e A309095 1 to 13 can be covered with 5 geometric progressions: (1,2,4,8), (3,6,12), (5,7), (9,10), (11,13). So a(5) = 13.
%e A309095 1 to 16 can be covered with 6 geometric progressions: (1,2,4,8,16), (3,6,12), (5,7), (9,10), (11,13), (14,15). So a(6) = 16.
