%N A309077 Maximum sum of base lengths over all minimal factorizations of length-n binary strings.
%C A309077 A factorization of a binary string x is an expression of the form prod_i w_i^{e_i}, where each w_i is a word and e_i is an integer exponent specifying how many times the word is repeated.  For example 0101000 = (01)^2 0^3.  A minimal factorization is one that minimizes the weight of the factorization, which is defined to be sum of the lengths of the w_i.   a(n) then measures the maximum weight over all length-n binary strings.
%C A309077 Since there are arbitrarily long binary words having no repetitions larger than squares (Thue 1906), we see that a(n) >= n/2.  By considering a(14) = 9, and splitting a word into blocks of size 14 and one left over, we see that a(n) <= 0.644 n for sufficiently large n.
%C A309077 Upper bound for sufficiently large n reduced to a(n) < 0.621 n considering a(29) = 18. - _Bert Dobbelaere_, Jul 21 2019
%F A309077 a(j+k) <= a(j) + a(k). - _Bert Dobbelaere_, Jul 21 2019
%e A309077 For n = 8, we have a(8) = 6, and a word that achieves the maximum is 01001101, where the corresponding weight-6 factorization is (01) 0^2 1^2 (01).
