%N A309096 Increasing positive integers with prime factorization exponents all appearing earlier in the sequence.
%C A309096 Because non-existing primes in the a factorization are recorded with exponent 0 here, and because 0 is not in the sequence, all entries must have a full set of prime divisors from 2 up to their largest prime: this is a subsequence of A055932. - _R. J. Mathar_, May 05 2023
%C A309096 3 and 5 do not appear in the sequence, so entries of A176297 or A362831 are not in the sequence. - _R. J. Mathar_, May 05 2023
