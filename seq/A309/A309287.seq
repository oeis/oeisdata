%N A309287 Square array T(v, m), read by antidiagonals, for the Rogel-Klee arithmetic function: number of positive integers h in the set [m] for which gcd(h, m) is v-th-power-free, i.e., gcd(h, m) is not divisible by any v-th power of an integer > 1 (with v, m >= 1).
%C A309287 For fixed v >= 1, T(v, .) is a multiplicative arithmetic function with T(v, 1) = 1; T(v, p^e) = p^e, if e < v; and T(v, p^e) = p^e - p^(e-v) if e >= v (where p is a prime >= 2).
%C A309287 Here, T(v=1, m) = phi(m) is the number of arithmetic progressions (s*m + k: s >= 0), k = 1, ..., m, that contain infinitely many primes (by Dirichlet's theorem). For v >= 2, T(v, m) is the number of these arithmetic progressions that contain infinitely many v-th-power-free numbers.
%C A309287 In Section 6 of his paper, Cohen (1959) mentions that this function was introduced by Rogel (1900) in an article published in a Bohemian journal. Roger's (1900) paper is a continuation of Rogel (1897) and the two should be read together.
%C A309287 McCarthy (1958) uses the asymptotic result given in the FORMULA section below to prove that the probability that the GCD of two positive integers is v-th-power-free is 1/zeta(2*v).

%H A309287 Franz Rogel, <a href="https://archive.org/details/vestnkkrlovs1900kn/page/n863">Entwicklung einiger zahlentheoreticher Funktionen in unendliche Reihen</a>, S.-B. Kgl. Bohmischen Ges. Wiss. Article XXX (1900), Prague (9 pages). [This is a continuation of the previous article, which was written three years earlier and has the same title. The numbering of the equations continues from the previous paper, but this paper is the one that introduces the function phi_k(n). In our notation, T(v, m) = phi_v(m). Cohen (1959) refers to this paper and correctly attributes this function to F. Rogel.]
%F A309287 T(v, m) = m * Product_{p prime and p^v|m} (1 - p^(-v)) for v, m >= 1.
%F A309287 T(v, m) = Sum_{n >= 1} mu(n) * [m, n^v] * (m/n^v), where [m, n^v] = 1 when m is a multiple of n^v, and = 0 otherwise. [This is Eq. (53) in Rogel (1900) and Eq. (6.1) in Cohen (1959).]
%F A309287 Dirichlet g.f. for row v: Sum_{m >= 1} T(v, m)/m^s = zeta(s-1)/zeta(v*s) for Re(s) > 1.
%F A309287 Asymptotics: Sum_{m = 1..n} T(v, m) = n^2/(2*zeta(2*v)) + O(n) for v >= 2 and = n^2/(2*zeta(2)) + O(n*log(n)) for v = 1 (for Euler's phi-function).
%F A309287 Analog of Fermat's theorem: if gcd(a, m) = 1 with a >= 1, then m/gcd(a^T(v, m) - 1, m) is v-th-power-free. (For v = 1, this means m/gcd(a^T(v=1, m) - 1, m) = 1.)
%F A309287 T(v, m^v)/m^v = Sum_{d|m} mu(d)/d^v for m, v >= 1. (It generalizes the formula phi(m)/m = Sum_{d|m} mu(d)/d since phi(m) = T(v=1, m).)
