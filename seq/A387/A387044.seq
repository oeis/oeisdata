%N A387044 Nonnegative numbers k for which there exists a largest circle enclosing exactly k points (strictly inside) on a square grid, as opposed to only a least upper bound on that circle size.
%C A387044 Steinhaus shows that a circle enclosing exactly k points always exists.
%C A387044 The question for k is whether the set of circle sizes enclosing exactly k points has a maximum, or only a least upper bound.
%C A387044 This sequence is unbounded.

%e A387044 4 is a term since a circle of radius sqrt(10)/2 encloses exactly 4 points, and no larger circle does so.
%e A387044 5 is not a term since there are circles strictly smaller than radius sqrt(10)/2 but arbitrarily close to it which enclose exactly 5 points; but at sqrt(10)/2 or greater they cannot, so there is no largest circle, only a least upper bound (sqrt(10)/2).
