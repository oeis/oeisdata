%N A387988 Number of intersection types when n circular arcs pass through a single point, reduced for symmetry.
%C A387988 At the intersection point, arcs may be tangent to one another or may cross each other normally. Any additional intersections occurring outside the point where all arcs cross are irrelevant. The result holds not only for circular arcs but for any curve of degree 2 or similar.
%C A387988 A(n) is equal to the number of words formed of n A's and n B's, with characters appearing either as singletons or in bundles (here notated in square brackets), with the following restrictions:
%C A387988 1) within a bundle, any and all A's appear before any and all B's
%C A387988 2) the second half of the word is entirely determined by the first half: each character in the first half-word appears, flipped to the other character, n positions later in the word, except that bundles not only have their characters flipped, but they reappear in internally reversed order in the second half-word. For example the bundle [AAABB] in the first half-word will be reversed to [BBAAA] then character-flipped to become [AABBB] in the second half-word.
%C A387988 3) Such a word must not begin mid-bundle
%C A387988 4) Words belong to equivalence classes under circular rotation (limited to rotations that do not begin mid-bundle) and mirror reflection, wherein the word appears in reverse order (bundles remain whole but internally reversed) AND with all characters flipped.
%C A387988 The correspondance between words and intersection types can be seen in the images included as examples. Each circular arc is represented by an A at the end that curves to the left when departing the intersection point, and a B at the end that curves to the right when departing the intersection point. The arc types (A or B) are read in a clockwise order around the point of intersection. Groups of letters in the word enclosed within square brackets indicate a "tangent bundle" of arcs, i.e. ones that are all tangent to one another at the intersection point.
