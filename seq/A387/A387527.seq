%N A387527 a(n) = largest k such that, starting at n, the k pairs (n,n+1), (n+1,n+2), ... (n+k-1,n+k) have the "Distinct Prime Exponents" (DPE) property.
%C A387527 Two positive integers x and y have the "Distinct Prime Exponents" (or DPE) property if their prime factorizations x = Product p_i^e_i and y = Product q_i^f_i are such that the exponent sets {e_i} and {f_i} are disjoint.
%C A387527 For example, if x = 24 = 2^3*3^1 and 28 = 2^2*7^1, {e_i} = {1,3} and {f_i} = {1,2} are not disjoint, so 24 and 28 do not have the DPE property.
%C A387527 On the other hand, if x = 24 = 2^3*3^1 and y = 25 = 5^2, {e_i} = {1,3} and {f_i} = {2} are disjoint, so 24 and 25 do have the DPE.
%C A387527 At the present time, only one number n out to at least 10^12 has a(n) >= 4, namely a(24) = 4.
