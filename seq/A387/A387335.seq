%N A387335 1, 2, 4, along with numbers divisible by at least two distinct primes.
%C A387335 The Jordan totient function is defined by the formula J_k(n) = n^k * Product{p prime divisor of n} (1-1/p^k). Because of the combinatorial origin of this function, it was originally understood that k must be a natural number. However, the formula still provides usable values for all positive real values of k.
%C A387335 Now define the Jordan cototient function by CoJ_k(n) = n^k - J_k(n). Then it appears that the terms of this sequence are precisely the values of n for which CoJ_k(n) achieves a new record for sufficiently small positive k. This includes 1, 2, 4, and the numbers that are not prime powers (A024619).
