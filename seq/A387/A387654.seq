%N A387654 Numbers k such that each of k and k+1 is either a practical number (A005153) or an almost practical number (A174533).
%C A387654 Differs from A103289 by not having the terms 7424, 27404, 43064, 56924, 70784, ... . The first 344 terms of this sequence are in A103289. Is this sequence a subsequence of A103289?
%C A387654 Differs from A096399 by not having the terms 7424, 27404, 43064, 56924, 70784, ... . The first 342 terms after 1 and 4095 are in A096399. Is this sequence \ {1, 4095} a subsequence of A096399?
%C A387654 Terms k such that both k and k+1 are almost practical numbers are in A387653.
%C A387654 The only pair of consecutive integers that are both practical is 1 and 2, since 1 is the only odd practical number.
%C A387654 All the rest are pairs in which one member (the odd member) is almost practical and the second member (the even member) is practical.
%C A387654 Are there 3 consecutive numbers that are all either practical or almost practical? There are none below 2.8*10^6.
%C A387654 From _David A. Corneth_, Sep 06 2025: (Start)
%C A387654 There are no 3 consecutive numbers that are all either practical or almost practical.
%C A387654 Some definitions and properties:
%C A387654 Odd almost practical numbers are divisible by 15.
%C A387654 Practical numbers > 1 are even.
%C A387654 Almost practical numbers are not 5-rough (numbers with no prime factors < 5 (Cf. A007310)).
%C A387654 Proof:
%C A387654 If the middle number is even then the adjacent numbers are odd hence cannot be practical. At most one of them is a multiple of 3 so the other is 5-rough hence not almost practical. A contradiction.
%C A387654 If the middle number is odd then it must be almost practical hence divisible by 3 and by 5. The adjacent numbers are even.
%C A387654 One of them has multiplicity of 2 in prime factorization of 1. That number cannot be divisible by 3 or 5.
%C A387654 Therefore 4, 5 and 6 cannot be written as sums of distinct divisors of that number.
%C A387654 Thus the middle number cannot be odd and cannot be even hence it does not exist. (End)
