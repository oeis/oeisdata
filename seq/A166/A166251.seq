%N A166251 Isolated primes: Primes p such that there is no other prime in the interval [2*prevprime(p/2), 2*nextprime(p/2)].
%C A166251 Other formulation:  Suppose a prime p >= 5 lies in the interval (2p_k, 2p_(k+1)), where p_n is the n-th prime; p is called isolated if the interval (2p_k, 2p_(k+1)) does not contain any other primes.
%C A166251 The sequence is connected with the following classification of primes: The first two primes 2,3 form a separate set of primes; let p >= 5 be in interval(2p_k, 2p_(k+1)), then 1)if in this interval there are primes only more than p, then p is called a right prime; 2) if in this interval there are primes only less than p, then p is called a left prime; 3) if in this interval there are prime more and less than p, then p is called a central prime; 4) if this interval does not contain other primes, then p is called an isolated prime. In particular, the right primes form sequence A166307 and all Ramanujan primes (A104272) more than 2 are either right or central primes; the left primes form sequence A182365 and all Labos primes (A080359) greater than 3 are either left or central primes.
%C A166251 From _Peter Munn_, Jun 01 2023: (Start)
%C A166251 The isolated primes are prime(k) such that k-1 and k occur as consecutive terms in A020900.
%C A166251 In the tree of primes described in A290183, the isolated primes label the nodes with no sibling nodes.
%C A166251 Conjecture: a(n)/A000040(n) is asymptotic to 9. This would follow from my conjectured asymptotic proportion of 1's in A102820 (the first differences of A020900).
