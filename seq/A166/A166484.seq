%N A166484 Prime sums of three Fermat numbers: primes of form 2^2^x + 2^2^y + 5.
%C A166484 One can have a prime sum of two Fermat Primes, starting with 2 + 3 = 5.
%C A166484 Hence this current sequence is a proper subset of prime sums of a Fermat prime number of Fermat numbers, which in turn is a proper subset of prime sums of a Fermat number of Fermat numbers.
%C A166484 According to the Maple 9 primality test, the next term is larger than 10^300 if it exists. - _R. J. Mathar_, Oct 16 2009
%C A166484 At least one of the three Fermat numbers must be 3 because all Fermat numbers greater than 3 are equal to 2 (mod 3). Hence, the sum of three Fermat numbers greater than 3 is always a multiple of 3.
%C A166484 The next term, if it exists, has at least 1262612 digits. - _Arkadiusz Wesolowski_, Mar 06 2011
