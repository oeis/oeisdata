%N A166323 Numbers in which all the digits are larger than the arithmetic mean of their two neighbors.
%C A166323 Last term of the sequence is a(3569) = 36899863.
%C A166323 The criterion on the arithmetic mean is only applied to the digits which have two neighbors, that is, not to the first and last digit.
%C A166323 If we look at the isolated digits d(i) of n = sum_i d(i)*10^(i-1) as function values defined over the regular abscissas of i=1,2,..., the criterion is equivalent to saying that the discrete approximation of the second derivative of the function is negative where defined, that is, the function is everywhere concave.
%C A166323 From _Rick L. Shepherd_, Feb 20 2013: (Start)
%C A166323 There are 405, 925, 1149, 781, 271, 38 terms of digit lengths 3 through 8, respectively, where 110, 1220, 13320, 134430, 1466530, 14677640 are the least and 998, 9986, 99863, 899863, 6899863, 36899863 are the greatest.
%C A166323 This sequence has the property that any three-digit-or-larger substring of a term's digit string is a term. Hence the fact that there is no nine-digit term proves there are no terms with even more digits. The sequence of terms that are not substrings of greater terms begins 110, 120, 121, 130, 131, 140, 141, 142, 150, 151, 152, 160, 161, 162, 163, 170, .... (End)
