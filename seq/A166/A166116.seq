%N A166116 Cardinality of point system found by an explicit construction in 2^n dimensions.
%C A166116 From Horvath. Note that the construction is not optimal, as they get a better point system with cardinality 135340 by modification of the construction. In this paper using the concept of the extended Hamming code we give a construction for dense packing of points at distance at least one in such unit cubes which dimension are a power of two. 17 is prime; 481 = 13 * 37 is semiprime; 1351361 = 11 * 43 * 2857.
