%N A249336 a(1) = 1; for n>1, a(n) = number of values k in range 1 .. n-1 such that {sum of prime indices in the prime factorization of a(k)} = {sum of prime indices in the prime factorization of a(n-1)}, both counted with multiplicity.
%C A249336 The initial occurrences of primes appear in ascending order. After a(1) and a(2), 1's occur only after each such initial occurrence of a prime, followed by that prime's index (in A000040) + 2.

%F A249336 a(1) = 1; for n>1, a(n) = number of values k in range 1 .. n-1 such that A056239(a(k)) = A056239(a(n-1)).
%e A249336 a(1) = 1 by definition.
%e A249336 For n = 2, we see that a(n-1) = a(1) = 1, the sum of whose prime indices is 0, and the only integer k for which A056239(k) = 0 is 1, and 1 occurs once among the terms a(1) .. a(1), thus a(2) = 1 also.
%e A249336 For n = 3, we see that a(n-1) = a(2) = 1 occurs two times among the terms a(1) .. a(2), thus a(3) = 2.
%e A249336 For n = 4, we see that a(n-1) = a(3) = 2, and A056239(2) = 1, and so far there are no other terms than a(3) in a(1) .. a(3) which would result the same sum, thus a(4) = 1.
%e A249336 For n = 5, we see that a(n-1) = a(4) = 1 occurs three times in a(1) .. a(4), thus a(5) = 3.
%e A249336 For n = 6, we see that a(n-1) = a(5) = 3, and A056239(3) = 2 (as 3 = p_2), and so far there are no other terms than a(5) in a(1) .. a(5) which would result the same sum, thus a(6) = 1.
%e A249336 For n = 7, we see that a(n-1) = a(6) = 1 occurs four times in a(1) .. a(6), thus a(7) = 4.
%e A249336 For n = 8, we see that a(n-1) = a(7) = 4, and A056239(4) = 2 (as 4 = p_1 * p_1), and so far among the terms a(1) .. a(7) only a(5) results in the same sum, thus a(8) = 2.
