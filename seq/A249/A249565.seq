%N A249565 Number of self-avoiding walks on the truncated square tiling with n steps.
%C A249565 A self-avoiding walk is a sequence of adjacent points in a lattice that are all distinct.  The truncated square tiling is a semiregular tiling by regular polygons of the Euclidean plane with one square and two octagons on each vertex.  The edge lattice is also referred to as (4,8^2) lattice.  It is also the Cayley graph of the Coxeter group generated by three generators {s_0, s_1, s_2} with the relations s_i^2 = 1, s_0 s_2 = s_2 s_0, (s_i s_{i+1})^4 = 1 for i=0,1.
%C A249565 It is conjectured that a(n) is approximately mu^n*n^{11/32} for large n where mu is the connective constant and mu is approximately 1.80883001(6).
