%N A249148 a(1) = 1, after which, if a(n-1) = 1, a(n) = 1 + the total number of 1's that have occurred in the sequence so far, otherwise a(n) = the total number of times the least prime dividing a(n-1) [i.e., A020639(a(n-1))] occurs as a divisor (counted with multiplicity for each term) in the previous terms from a(1) up to and including a(n-1).
%C A249148 Inspired by A248034.
%C A249148 After a(1), it is very likely that 1's occur only just after primes, although they do not necessarily occur after every prime. For example, 13 is the first prime whose initial occurrence is not followed by 1.

%e A249148 a(1) = 1 by definition.
%e A249148 For n = 2, we see that a(1) = 1, which is the only 1 that has occurred in the sequence so far, and thus a(2) = 1+1 = 2.
%e A249148 For n = 3, we see that a(2) = 2, with the least prime dividing it being 2, which has occurred so far only once (namely in a(2)), thus a(3) = 1.
%e A249148 For n = 4, we see that a(3) = 1, and there has occurred two 1's so far (as a(1) and a(3)), thus a(4) = 2+1 = 3.
%e A249148 For n = 5, we see that a(4) = 3, with the least prime dividing it being 3, which has occurred now just once, thus a(5) = 1.
%e A249148 For n = 6, we see that a(5) = 1, and there has occurred three 1's so far (as a(1), a(3) and a(5)), thus a(6) = 3+1 = 4.
%e A249148 For n = 7, we see that a(6) = 4 = 2*2, with its least prime 2 dividing it two times, and also occurring once at a(2), thus a(7) = 3.
