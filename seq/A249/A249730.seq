%N A249730 Odd nonprime terms in A250251.
%C A249730 This sequence lists the numbers which together with all their multiples with the powers of 2 give the starting values for the prime recurrences whose union is A250251, the fixed points of permutations A250249 and A250250.
%C A249730 After 1, contains the terms from columns 2 and 3 of the Sieve of Eratosthenes: A083140 (A083221), but only from those rows r for which A055396(r) (the index of smallest dividing prime r) is fixed by A250249 and A250250, i.e., is in A250251. The first r for which this is not the case is 73, which is in A249729 instead. However, because there are infinitely many primes in A250251, and especially because 2 and 3 are among them, this sequence is infinite.
