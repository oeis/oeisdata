%N A232753 a(n) = the number of times needed to iterate Hofstadter's A030124, starting from A030124(1)=2, that the result were >= n; a(n) = the least k such that A232739(k) >= n.
%C A232753 Does the ratio a(n)/A232746(n) converge towards some limit?

%e A232753 A030124(1)=2 (counted as the first iteration)
%e A232753 A030124(2)=4 (counted as the second iteration)
%e A232753 A030124(4)=6 (counted as the third iteration)
%e A232753 Thus a(4)=2 as we reached 4 in two iterations, but a(5) = a(6) = 3, as three iterations of A030124 are needed to reach a number that is larger than or equivalent to 5, or respectively, 6.
