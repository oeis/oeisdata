%N A232528 Numbers n such that for all primes p where p and p-n are quadratic residues (mod 4*n), 4*p can be written as x^2 + n*y^2.
%C A232528 Convenient numbers (A000926) are numbers n such that for all primes p where p and p-n are quadratic residues (mod 4*n), p can be written as x^2 + n*y^2, so convenient numbers are a subsequence.
%C A232528 All non-convenient numbers which are members of this sequence are either congruent to 0 (mod 4) or 3 (mod 4).
%C A232528 The equation 4*p = x^2 + n*y^2 is important because if n is a squarefree integer congruent to 3 (mod 4), then the ring of integers Q[sqrt(-n)] will be all integers of form (x/2) + (y/2)*sqrt(-n) for x and y of the same parity, whose norm is (x/2)^2 + n*(y/2)^2. If prime p = (x/2)^2 + n*(y/2)^2, then 4*p = x^2 + n*y^2.
%C A232528 Is this sequence finite?
%C A232528 Is 7392 the largest term of this sequence?
%C A232528 There are no further terms up to 10^6. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Jun 08 2018

%e A232528 n = 14 is not a member of this sequence because for prime p = 71, 4*p = 284 cannot be written as x^2 + 14*y^2.
