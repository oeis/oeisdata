%N A232174 Number of ways to write n = x + y (x, y > 0) with x + n*y and x^2 + n*y^2 both prime.
%C A232174 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 1. Also, a(n) = 1 only for n = 2, 5, 8, 14, 19, 20, 24, 32, 54, 68, 101, 168.
%C A232174 (ii) Every n = 3, 4, ... can be written as x + y (x, y > 0) with x*n + y and x*n - y both prime.
%C A232174 (iii) Any integer n > 2 can be written as P + q (q > 0) with p and p + n*q both prime. Also, any integer n > 7 can be written as p + q (q > 0) with p and n*q - p both prime.
%C A232174 In a paper published in 2017, the author announced a USD $200 prize for the first solution to his conjecture that a(n) > 0 for all n > 1. - _Zhi-Wei Sun_, Dec 03 2017
