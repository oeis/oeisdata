%N A232269 Number of ways to write 2*n + 1 = x + y (x, y > 0) with x^3 + y^2 and x^2 + y^2 both prime.
%C A232269 Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n > 0. Also, any odd integer greater than one can be written as x + y (0 < x < y) with x^3 + y^2 prime.
%C A232269 The conjecture implies that there are infinitely many primes of the form x^3 + y^2 (x, y > 0) with x^2 + y^2 also prime.
%C A232269 Note that Ming-Zhi Zhang ever asked (cf. A036468) whether any odd integer greater than one can be written as x + y (x, y > 0) with x^2 + y^2 prime.
