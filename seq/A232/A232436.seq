%N A232436 Numbers which are uniquely decomposable into x^2+xy+y^2, the unique decomposition being with two distinct nonzero x and y.
%C A232436 These are the primitive elements of A024606, the integers which are expressible as x^2 + xy + y^2 with distinct nonzero x and y.
%C A232436 As a subsequence of A003136 (Loeschian numbers), the sequence is related with the triangular lattice: circles with radius sqrt(a(n)) centered at a grid point in this lattice hit exactly 12 points, cf. A004016.
%C A232436 Numbers with exactly one prime factor of form 6k+1 with multiplicity one and no prime factor of form 3k+2 with odd multiplicity, that is a(n) is of form 3^a*p*q^2, with a>=0, p a prime of form 6k+1, and q an integer with all its prime factors of form 3k+2. There is thus no square in the sequence.
%C A232436 From a(n) = 3^a*p*q^2, it is easily seen that sigma(a(n)) = 2 mod 6,
%C A232436 thus this sequence is a subsequence of A074628: the two sequences are equal up to a(308) = 1723; then A074628(309)= 1729 = a(1)*a(2)*a(3),  the famous Ramanujan's taxi number, and a(309) = A074628(310) = 1731.
%C A232436 The square of these numbers is also uniquely decomposable into the form x^2 + xy + y^2 with x and y > 0, thus this sequence is a subsequence of A232437.

%F A232436 Terms are obtained by the products A230781(k)*A002476(p) for k, p > 0, ordered by increasing values.
%F A232436 A004016(a(n))=12.
%e A232436 a(1)= 7 = 2^2+2+1, a(2)= 13 = 3^2+3+1. However 3 = 1+1+1 and 4 = 2^2+0*2+0 are not in the sequence because the unique decomposition of these numbers is not with two distinct nonzero numbers; 49, 147 are also excluded because there are two decompositions of these numbers (including one with equal or zero components x and y).
