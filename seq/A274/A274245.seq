%N A274245 Numbers n such that n*(n+1)/2 is a Taxi-cab number (A001235).
%C A274245 In other words, numbers n such that 0 + 1 + 2 + ... + n = a^3 + b^3 = c^3 + d^3 where (a, b) and (c, d) are distinct pairs and a, b, c, d > 0 is soluble.
%C A274245 It is known that there is no triangular number that is also a cube except 0 and 1. So if the sum of k positive cubes is a triangular number that is bigger than 1, then the minimum value of k is 2. At this point sequence focuses on that question: What are the triangular numbers that are the sum of two positive cubes in more than one way?
%C A274245 A000217(349999) = 61249825000 is the least triangular number that is also a Taxi-cab number.
