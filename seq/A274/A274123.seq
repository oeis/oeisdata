%N A274123 Let F(g,p) be the frequency of g up to the prime nextprime(p+1). F(g,p_i) is a record for some prime p_i and F(g, p_(i+1)) is a new record for the next larger prime after p_i. The sequence lists the primes p_(i+1), except a(1) = 2.
%C A274123 Up to large values of n, 6 is conjectured to be the most occurring gap. See link "Polignac's conjecture". If this conjecture is true the sequence is finite.
%C A274123 For primes up to 10^8, there are no more terms. Up to 10^6, the prime gap 2 occurs 8169 times, the gap 4 occurs 8143 times and the gap 6 occurs 13549 times.

%e A274123 Before counting gaps, all gaps are zero, so the first pass happens after the first prime, 2. Up to and including 113, a gap of 2 occurs at least as often as any other gap. At prime 113, the gaps 2 and 4 are the most frequent (both occur 10 times). After 127, the next prime after 113, there is a gap of 4. So at the prime 127, the gap 4 has occurs the most of all gaps. This was not the case at the prime previous to 127 (the prime 113). Therefore, 127 is in the sequence.
