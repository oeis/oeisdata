%N A271721 Number of ordered ways to write n as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 with x >= y >= z >= 0, x > 0 and w >= z such that (x-y)*(w-z) is a square.
%C A271721 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 0, and a(n) = 1 only for n = 1, 3, 5, 11, 15, 23, 35, 95, 4^k*190 (k = 0,1,2,...).
%C A271721 (ii) For each k = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, 20, 22, 25, 27, 29, 33, 37, 38, 41, 50, 61, any natural number can be written as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 with x,y,z,w nonnegative integers such that (x-y)*(w-k*z) is a square.
%C A271721 (iii) For each triple (a,b,c) = (3,1,1), (1,2,1), (2,2,1), (3,2,1), (2,2,2), (6,2,1), (1,3,1), (3,3,1), (15,3,1), (1,4,1), (2,4,1), (1,5,1), (3,5,1), (5,5,1), (1,5,2), (1,6,1), (2,6,1), (3,6,1), (15,6,1), (1,7,1), (5,7,1), (1,8,1), (1,8,5), (3,9,1), (1,10,1), (1,12,1), (1,13,1), (3,13,1), (1,14,1), (1,15,1), (1,15,2), (6,16,1), (2,18,1), (3,18,1), (1,20,2), (1,21,1), (3,21,1), (1,23,1), (1,24,1), (1,27,1), (3,27,1), (1,34,1), (1,45,1), (3,45,1), (3,48,1), (1,55,1), (1,60,1), (5,60,1), any natural number can be written as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 with x,y,z,w nonnegative integers such that a*(x+b*y)*(w-c*z) is a square.
%C A271721 This is stronger than Lagrange's four-square theorem. Note that for k = 2 or 3, any natural number n can be written as w^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 with w,x,y,z nonnegative integers and (x-y)*(w-k*z) = 0, for, if n cannot be represented by x^2 + y^2 + 2*z^2 then it has the form 4^k*(16*m+14) (k,m = 0,1,2,...) and hence it can be represented by x^2 + y^2 + (k^2+1)*z^2. It is known that natural numbers not represented by x^2 + y^2 + 5*z^2 have the form 4^k*(8*m+3), and that positive even numbers not represented by x^2 + y^2 + 10*z^2 have the form 4^k*(16*m+6) (as conjectured by S. Ramanujan and proved by L. E. Dickson).
