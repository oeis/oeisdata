%N A271219 Number n of antichains of P(En) x En*, ordered by lexicographic order, with En a poset of n elements with no pair of elements ordered, and with En* that same set augmented with an (n+1)th element smaller than all others.
%C A271219 This sequence is, more interestingly, the number of logical consequence relations in (n+2)-valued logic, with no order between intermediate values (i.e., values other than 0 and 1), which are truth functional, identical to the standard logical consequence relation on bivalent propositions and value-monotonic (if the relation holds, it is preserved with stronger premises and/or weaker conclusions). See reference below.
%C A271219 In n-valued logic with all truth values strictly ordered, the number of logical consequence relations with the same properties is more standard, it corresponds to: A030662. It satisfies the same definition as this sequence except that En should now be understood as a well-ordered set of n elements.
