%N A271103 Number of magic and semi-magic squares of order n composed of the numbers from 1 to n^2, counted up to rotations and reflections.
%C A271103 A semi-magic square differs from a magic square in that at least one of its main diagonals does not sum to the magic constant. [_Walter Trump_]
%C A271103 The number of order 4 magic and semi-magic squares was computed by Mutsumi Suzuki, and could be found on his former web site. Mutsumi Suzuki's pages are now hosted by Math Forum at Drexel University.
%C A271103 The number of order 5 magic and semi-magic squares was computed by _Walter Trump_ in March 2000.
%C A271103 The number of order 6 magic and semi-magic squares was calculated by Artem Ripatti in April 2018, and published in his paper dated July 10, 2018. - _William Walkington_, Jul 17 2018
