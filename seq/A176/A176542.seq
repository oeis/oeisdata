%N A176542 Numbers k such that there are only a finite nonzero number of sets of k consecutive triangular numbers that sum to a square.
%C A176542 Members of A176541, for which there are only a finite number of solutions.
%C A176542 Integer k is in this sequence if k=2*m^2 and the equation (2*x-m*y)*(2*x+m*y)=A077415(k)/2 has integer solutions with y>=k. - _Max Alekseyev_, May 10 2010

%F A176542 Conjectures from _Colin Barker_, Sep 24 2015: (Start)
%F A176542 a(n) = (9*n^2+24*n+16)/2 for n even.
%F A176542 a(n) = (9*n^2+30*n+25)/2 for n odd.
%F A176542 a(n) = a(n-1)+2*a(n-2)-2*a(n-3)-a(n-4)+a(n-5) for n>5.
%F A176542 G.f.: -2*x*(4*x^4-3*x^3-8*x^2+9*x+16) / ((x-1)^3*(x+1)^2). (End)
%F A176542 These conjectures are true (see Fried link). - _Sela Fried_, Jan 02 2026
%e A176542 32 is in this sequence because there is only one set of 32 consecutive triangular numbers that sum to a square (namely, A000217(26) thru A000217(57), which sum to 29584 = 172^2).
%e A176542 3 is NOT in this sequence, because there are infinitely many sets of 3 consecutive triangular numbers that sum to a square (cf. A165517).
%e A176542 4 is NOT in this sequence, because there are infinitely many sets of 4 consecutive triangular numbers that sum to a square (cf. A202391).
%e A176542 5 is NOT in this sequence, because there are NO sets of 5 consecutive triangular numbers that sum to a square.
%e A176542 11 is NOT in this sequence, since there are infinitely many sets of 11 consecutive triangular numbers that sum to a square (cf. A116476).
