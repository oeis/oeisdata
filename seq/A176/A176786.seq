%N A176786 Last nonzero digit of A000043(n)!.
%C A176786 The C program, from first link, is based on a new method, see second link. It was developed from a congruence found in the first reference "Concrete Mathematics". The function D() of this program implements the simple division algorithm found in "D. E. Knuth, The Art of Computer Programming, V.2." (second reference). Another approach can be to use Dresden's formula that can be found from the third link.  One can use the function LastDigit() of the mentioned program to find the last nonzero digit of N! for very large values of N. The factorial of the 47th (known) Mersenne prime has approximately 10^12,978,195 digits.
%C A176786 Many other algorithms for the general problem of finding the last nonzero digit of a factorial are given in A008904. - _D. S. McNeil_, Dec 10 2010

%F A176786 a(n) = A008904(2^A000043(n)-1) = A008904(A000668(n)).
%e A176786 a(1) = 6 since the first Mersenne prime is 3, and 3! = 6.
