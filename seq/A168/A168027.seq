%Y A168027 Cf. A033951, all numbers of the form 4n^2 + 3n + 1. Noncomposites of the eastern ray are in A168022. Primes of the northeastern ray are in A073337. Noncomposites of the northern ray are in A168023. Primes of the northwestern ray are in A121326. Noncomposites of the western ray are in A168025. Noncomposites of the southwestern ray are in A168026. There are no primes on the southeastern ray, which, being A016754, are the odd squares, and thus none of them are prime.
