%e A168506 There are a(4) = 8 trees of total weight 4, which can be described as follows. There are 2 rooted plane trees of size 3 and 1 rooted plane tree of size 1. Adding/planting an extra root and coloring it red or blue yields 2*2 = 4 planted plane trees of size 4 and 2*1 = 2 planted plane trees of size 2. Then the 8 trees of weight 4 are obtained as: the 1*4 = 4 trees obtained by taking the (only) rooted plane tree on one node and replacing its node with one of the planted plane trees of size 4, and the 2*2 = 4 trees obtained by taking the (only) rooted plane tree on two nodes and replacing each node with a planted plane tree of size 2.
