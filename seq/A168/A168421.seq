%N A168421 Small Associated Ramanujan Prime, p_(i-n).
%C A168421 a(n) is the smallest prime p_(k+1-n) on the left side of the Ramanujan Prime Corollary, 2*p_(i-n) > p_i for i > k, where the n-th Ramanujan Prime R_n is the k-th prime p_k. [Comment clarified and shortened by _Jonathan Sondow_, Dec 20 2013]
%C A168421 Smallest prime number, a(n), such that if x >= a(n), then there are at least n primes between x and 2x exclusively.
%C A168421 This is very useful in showing the number of primes in the range [p_k, 2*p_(i-n)] is greater than or equal to 1. By taking into account the size of the gaps between primes in [p_(i-n),p_k], one can see that the average prime gap is about log(p_k) using the following R_n / (2*n) ~ log(R_n).
%C A168421 Proof of Corollary: See Wikipedia link
%C A168421 The number of primes until the next Ramanujan prime, R_(n+1), can be found in A190874.
%C A168421 Not the same as A124136.
%C A168421 A084140(n) is the smallest integer where ceiling ((A104272(n)+1)/2), a(n) is the next prime after A084140(n). - _John W. Nicholson_, Oct 09 2013
%C A168421 If a(n) is in A005382(k) then A005383(k) is a twin prime with the Ramanujan prime, A104272(n) = A005383(k) - 2, and A005383(k) = A168425(n). If this sequence has an infinite number of terms in A005382, then the twin prime conjecture can be proved. - _John W. Nicholson_, Dec 05 2013
%C A168421 Except for A000101(1)=3 and A000101(2)=5, A000101(k) = a(n). Because of the large size of a gap, there are many repeats of the prime number in this sequence. - _John W. Nicholson_, Dec 10 2013
%C A168421 For some n and k, we see that a(n) = A104272(k) as to form a chain of primes similar to a Cunningham chain. For example (and the first example), a(2) = 7, links A104272(2) = 11 = a(3), links A104272(3) = 17 = a(4), links A104272(4) = 29 = a(6), links A104272(6) = 47. Note that the links do not have to be of a form like q = 2*p+1 or q = 2*p-1. - _John W. Nicholson_, Dec 14 2013
%C A168421 Srinivasan's Lemma (2014): p_(k-n) < (p_k)/2 if R_n = p_k and n > 1. Proof: By the minimality of R_n, the interval ((p_k)/2,p_k] contains exactly n primes, so p_(k-n) < (p_k)/2. - _Jonathan Sondow_, May 10 2014
%C A168421 In spite of the name Small Associated Ramanujan Prime, a(n) is not a Ramanujan prime for many values of n. - _Jonathan Sondow_, May 10 2014
%C A168421 Prime index of a(n), pi(a(n)) = i-n, is equal to A179196(n) - n + 1. - _John W. Nicholson_, Sep 15 2015
%C A168421 All maximal prime pairs in A002386 and A000101 are bounded by, for a particular n and i, the prime A104272(n) and twice a prime in A000040() following a(n). This means the gap between maximal prime pair cannot be more than twice the prior maximal prime gap. - _John W. Nicholson_, Feb 07 2019

%e A168421 For n=10, the n-th Ramanujan prime is A104272(n)= 97, the value of k = 25, so i is >= 26, i-n >= 16, the i-n prime is 53, and 2*53 = 106. This leaves the range [97, 106] for the 26th prime which is 101. In this example, 53 is the small associated Ramanujan prime.
