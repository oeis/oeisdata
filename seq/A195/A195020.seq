%N A195020 Vertex number of a square spiral in which the length of the first two edges are the legs of the primitive Pythagorean triple [3, 4, 5]. The edges of the spiral have length A195019.
%C A195020 Zero together with the partial sums of A195019.
%C A195020 The spiral contains infinitely many Pythagorean triples in which the hypotenuses on the main diagonal are the positives A008587. The vertices on the main diagonal are the numbers A024966 = (3+4)*A000217 = 7*A000217, where both 3 and 4 are the first two edges in the spiral. The distance "a" between nearest edges that are perpendicular to the initial edge of the spiral is 3, while the distance "b" between nearest edges that are parallel to the initial edge is 4, so the distance "c" between nearest vertices on the same axis is 5 because from the Pythagorean theorem we can write c = (a^2+b^2)^(1/2) = sqrt(3^2+4^2) = sqrt(9+16) = sqrt(25) = 5.
%C A195020 Let an array have m(0,n)=m(n,0)=n*(n-1)/2 and m(n,n)=n*(n+1)/2. The first n+1 terms in row(n) are the numbers in the closed interval m(0,n) to m(n,n). The terms in column(n) are the same from m(n,0) to m(n,n). The first few antidiagonals are 0; 0,0; 1,1,1; 3,2,2,3; 6,4,3,4,6; 10,7,5,5,7,10. a(n) is the difference between the sum of the terms in the n+1 X n+1 matrices and those in the n X n matrices. - _J.
