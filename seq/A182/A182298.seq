%N A182298 Smallest complementary perimeter, as defined in the comments, among all sets of nonnegative integers whose volume (sum) is n.
%C A182298 The volume and perimeter of a set S of nonnegative integers are introduced in the reference.  The volume is defined simply as the sum of the elements of S, and the perimeter is defined as the sum of the elements of S whose predecessor and successor are not both in S.  The complementary perimeter (introduced in the link) of S is the perimeter of the complement of S in the set of nonnegative integers.

%F A182298 Following the notation in the link, for n >= 0, write n = (0+1+2+...+f(n)) - g(n), be the representation of n with f(n) and g(n) minimal such that 0 <= g(n) <= f(n).  Then f(n) = A002024(n) = round(sqrt(2n)), and g(n) = A025581(n) = f(n)*(f(n)+1)/2 - n.
%F A182298 Finally, let Q(n):=a(n), and let P(n):=A186053(n).  Then unless n is one of the 177 known counterexamples tabulated in the link, we have P(n) = f(n) + Q(g(n)), and Q(n) = 1 + f(n) + P(g(n)).
%e A182298 For n=8, the set S={0,1,3,4} has volume (total sum) 8 and complementary perimeter (the sum of 2 and 5) is 7.  No other set of volume 8 has a smaller complementary perimeter, so a(8)=7.
%e A182298 Similarly, for n=11, the set S={2,4,5} has volume 11=2+4+5 and complementary perimeter 10=1+3+6.  This is the smallest among all sets with volume 11, so a(11)=10.
