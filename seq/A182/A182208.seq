%N A182208 Carmichael numbers divisible by 7.
%C A182208 Conjecture: Any Carmichael number C divisible by 7 can be written in one of two ways: (1) C=7*(6m+1)*(6n+1), where m and n are natural numbers or (2) C=7*(6m-1)*(6n-1), where m and n are natural numbers. In other words, there aren't Carmichael numbers divisible by 7 of the form C=7*(6m+1)*(6n-1). Checked for the first 27 Carmichael numbers divisible by 7. Note: a Carmichael number with more than 3 prime divisors can be written (sometimes) in both ways: 41041 = 7*11*13*41 = 7*13*451 (form 1) = 7*11*533 = 7*41*143 (form 2).
%C A182208 Observation: in the first 100 Carmichael numbers with three prime divisors (not divisible by 3) there is no one to can be written as (6x+1)(6y+1)(6z-1), they are all of the form (6x+1)(6y+1)(6z+1), (6x-1)(6y-1)(6z-1) or (6x+1)(6y-1)(6z-1). Would not that be enough to make an assumption that there are no such Carmichael numbers with three prime divisors, or even more, that aren't Carmichael numbers even with more than three divisors to can be written this way?
%C A182208 The conjecture follows from Korselt's criterion. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Oct 02 2012
