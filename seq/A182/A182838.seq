%N A182838 H-toothpick sequence in the first quadrant starting with a D-toothpick placed on the diagonal [(0,1), (1,2)].
%C A182838 Needs a precise definition. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Feb 09 2023
%C A182838 An H-toothpick sequence is a toothpick sequence on a square grid that resembles a partial honeycomb of hexagons.
%C A182838 The structure has two types of elements: the classic toothpicks with length 1 and the "D-toothpicks"  with length sqrt(2).
%C A182838 Classic toothpicks are placed in the vertical direction and D-toothpicks are placed in a diagonal direction.
%C A182838 Each hexagon has area = 4.
%C A182838 The network looks like an elongated hexagonal lattice placed on the square grid so that all nodes of the hexagonal net coincide with some of the grid points of the square grid. Each node in the hexagonal network is represented with coordinates x,y.
%C A182838 The sequence gives the number of toothpicks and D-toothpicks after n steps. A182839 (first differences) gives the number added at the n-th stage.
%C A182838 [It appears that for this sequence a classic toothpick is a line segment of length 1 that is parallel to the y-axis. A D-toothpick is a line segment of length sqrt(2) with slope +-1. D stands for diagonal. It also appears that classic toothpicks are not placed on the y-axis. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Feb 06 2023]

%e A182838 We start at stage 0 with no toothpicks.
%e A182838 At stage 1 we place a D-toothpick [(0,1),(1,2)], so a(1)=1.
%e A182838 At stage 2 we place a toothpick [(1,2),(1,3)] and a D-toothpick [(1,2),(2,1)], so a(2)=1+2=3.
%e A182838 At stage 3 we place 4 elements: a D-toothpick [(1,3),(0,4)], a D-toothpick [(1,3),(2,4)], a D-toothpick [(2,1),(3,2)] and a toothpick [(2,1),(2,0)], so a(3)=3+4=7. Etc.
%e A182838 The first hexagon appears in the structure after 4 stages.
