%N A377993 Number of integers whose arithmetic derivative (A003415) is equal to A024451(n), the arithmetic derivative of the n-th primorial.
%C A377993 a(n) is the number of natural numbers k such that k' = A003415(k) = A024451(n). The solutions k are listed in A377992.
%C A377993 For 1! = 1, there is an infinite number of integers k for which k' = 1 (all the primes), therefore the starting offset is 2.

%F A377993 a(n) = A099302(A024451(n)).
%F A377993 a(n) = Sum_{k=1..A002620(A024451(n))} [A003415(k) = A024451(n)], where [ ] is the Iverson bracket.
%e A377993 There is just one number such that A003415(k) = A024451(2) = 5, and that is k=6, therefore a(2) = 1.
%e A377993 There are two numbers such that A003415(k) = A024451(3) = 31, and they are k=30 and k=58, therefore a(3) = 2.
