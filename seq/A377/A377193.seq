%N A377193 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of distinct positive integers such that any term j = a(n-1) with primorial kernel is followed by a prime, whereas any other term is followed by a number with prime factors p < q = Gpf(j) which do not divide j.
%C A377193 Following j = a(n-1), a term in A005932, a(n) is the smallest prime not already listed. Otherwise a(n) = smallest novel product of powers of non divisor primes of j; a number of the form: Product_{i = 0..k} p_i^e_i; p_i a prime < q = Gpf(j) which does not divide j, e_i >= 0, k = the number of primes p_i < q which do not divide j.
%C A377193 Adjacent terms are coprime and the greedy algorithm implied by the definition forces naked prime p to appear in advance of any multiple m*p of p; m >1.
%C A377193 Prime powers enter the sequence early, consequent to j having a single non divisor prime. A power of 3 is always followed by a power of 2.
%C A377193 Conjectures:
%C A377193 (i) A permutation of the positive integers in which the primes appear in order.
%C A377193 (ii)The sequence obeys Selcoe's theorem (see A280864) regarding numbers that have the same squarefree kernel, namely: Construct a sequence S_r = { m*r : rad(m) | r } = { k  : rad(k) = r }, squarefree r. Terms w in S_r appear in this sequence in order. This is to say, for example, that for r = 6, terms in A033845 = {6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 54, ...} appear in order.

%e A377193 a(1) = 1 implies a(2) = 2 since A007947(1) = A002110(1) = 1, and 2 is the earliest unrecorded prime so far, and likewise a(3) = 3. Since rad(3) = 3 is not a primorial number a(4) = 2^2 = 4, the smallest novel number derived from 2, the only non divisor prime of 3 and < 3.
%e A377193 a(8) = 8 implies a(9) = 11 because 8 is a term in A055932. The non divisor primes of 11 and < 11 are 2,3,5,7  and the smallest number which can be composed using some or all of these primes is a(10) = 3^2 = 9 (since 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 have all occurred previously). Consequently a(11) = 2^4 = 16, the smallest novel power of 2.
%e A377193 a(195) = 154 = 2*7*11, the non divisor primes < 11 are 3 and 5, so a(196) = 405 = 3^4*5 since all smaller candidates (3,5,9,15,25,45,75,81,125,135,243,375) have already appeared.
