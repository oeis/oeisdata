%N A377564 Primes that contain at least two different even digits and at least two different odd digits such that any permutation of the odd digits and any permutation of the even digits produces a prime.  Permutations with leading 0's are disregarded; i.e., if permutations of even digits in a prime p produce a number with a leading 0 that is not prime, p is still in the sequence.
%C A377564 Relaxed version of A376502.  For example, 2309 is not in A376502 since 329 is not prime; however, 2309 is in this sequence since nonprimes with leading 0s such as 329 that result from permutations of even digits are disregarded.
%C A377564 The primes in the sequence cannot contain 5.
%e A377564 The primes 80107 and 80701 are in the sequence even if permutations of even digits produce 187, 781, 8107, 8701 which are numbers with leading 0s that are not prime.
%Y A377564 Cf. A000040, A003459, A376500, A376501, A376502.
