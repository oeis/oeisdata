%N A377587 a(n) is the smallest odd integer m with m-2^k not squarefree for all 1<=k<=n.
%C A377587 After he had proved that infinitely many positive odd integers cannot be expressed as the sum of a prime and a power of two, Paul Erdős conjectured that every odd integer 1<m can be expressed as the sum of a squarefree number s and a power of two (with positive integer exponent): m=s+2^k. This sequence gives the smallest odd integers 1<m with m-2^k not being squarefree for all 1<=k<=n. Thus, if Erdős' Conjecture is true the sequence is monotonically increasing; and if the conjecture is false it becomes stationary at the first m without a representation as m=s+2^k.
