%N A380527 Numbers k such that k is a multiple of A327860(k), where A327860 is the arithmetic derivative of the primorial base exp-function.
%C A380527 It is conjectured that only terms of A276156 occur here. If any term of A177711 is included, then it must be one of the terms of A381037.
%C A380527 a(35) > A143293(10).
%C A380527 From _Antti Karttunen_, Jan 28 2026: (Start)
%C A380527 Sequence obtained by applying A276085 to the {intersection of A373487 and A048103} and sorting the terms into ascending order.
%C A380527 From this we see that the above conjecture is false: As that intersection contains at least one nonsquarefree term, 855523 = 67 * 113^2, the term x = A276085(855523) = 559469993635709872356669612125495026320977730 (with primorial base expansion A049345(x) = 200000000001000000000000000000) is a term of this sequence that is NOT in A276156.
