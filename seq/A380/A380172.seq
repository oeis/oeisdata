%N A380172 Second center column of elementary triangular automaton rule 54, from a lone 1 cell.
%C A380172 An Elementary Triangular Automaton (ETA) is a cellular automaton in the triangular grid where cells hold binary states and rules are local to the first neighborhood. There are 256 possible ETA rules.
%C A380172 Rule 54 (110110 in binary):
%C A380172 -----------------------------------------------
%C A380172 |state of the cell            |1|1|1|1|0|0|0|0|
%C A380172 |sum of the neighbors' states |3|2|1|0|3|2|1|0|
%C A380172 |cell's next state            |0|0|1|1|0|1|1|0|
%C A380172 -----------------------------------------------
%C A380172 The second center column is the sequence of states of the direct neighbors of the initial 1 cell.
