%N A380247 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of the k-th eliminated person in the variation of the Josephus elimination process for n people, where the number of people skipped correspond to the number of letters in the next number in English alphabet.
%C A380247 In this variation of the Josephus elimination process, the numbers 1 through n are arranged in a circle. A pointer starts at position 1. Then three people are skipped because number O-N-E has three letters, then the next person is eliminated. Next, three people are skipped because T-W-O has three letters, and the next person is eliminated. Then, five people are skipped because T-H-R-E-E has five letters, and so on. This repeats until no numbers remain. This sequence represents the triangle T(n, k), where n is the number of people in the circle, and T(n, k) is the elimination order of the k-th person in the circle.
%C A380247 In rows 4 and after, the first number is 4. In rows 8 and after, the second number is 8. In rows 14 and after, the third number is 14. In the limit the numbers form sequence A380202.

%e A380247 For n = 4 suppose four people are arranged in a circle corresponding to the fourth row of the triangle. Three people are skipped for each letter in O-N-E; then the 4th person is eliminated. This means the row starts with 4. The next three people are skipped, and the person eliminated is number 1. Thus, the next element in the row is 1. Then, 5 people are skipped, and the next person eliminated is number 3. Similarly, the last person eliminated is number 2. Thus, the fourth row of this triangle is 4, 1, 3, 2.
