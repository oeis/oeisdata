%N A133404 Table of sum of numerator and denominator of Farey sequences, read by rows.
%C A133404 Start with the Farey sequence F(n) of order n which is the sequence of completely reduced fractions between 0 and 1 which, when in lowest terms, have denominators less than or equal to n, arranged in order of increasing size. Each row begins with the sum 1 from {0/1}. Each row ends with the sum 2 from {1/1}. The number of elements of the n-th row is A005728(n).
