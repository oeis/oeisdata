%N A133459 Sums of two nonzero pentagonal pyramidal numbers.
%C A133459 Does this sequence ever include a pentagonal pyramidal number? That is, is it ever the case that A002411(i)=A002411(j)+A002411(k) as is often true for triangular pyramidal numbers (tetrahedral numbers) or square pyramidal numbers?
%C A133459 The answer to the above question is yes: A002411(30) + A002411(36) = 13950 + 23976 = 37926 = A002411(42) (see A172425). - _Chai Wah Wu_, Apr 16 2016
%F A133459 {A002411(i) + A002411(j) for i, j > 0} = {i^2*(i+1)/2 + j^2*(j+1)/2 for i, j > 0}.
