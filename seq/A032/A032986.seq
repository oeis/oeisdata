%C A032986 Consider the sequence with the first eight terms deleted: 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 53, 54, 55, ...
%C A032986 This sequence extends to infinity starting from the first 5-tuple cluster of 13,14,15,16,17 with higher clusters separated by multiples of 10 intervals. This sequence extended to infinity is completely devoid of twin primes.
%C A032986 Example: For n = 10, the sequence generated is: [[13, 14, 15, 16, 17], [23, 24, 25, 26, 27], [33, 34, 35, 36, 37], [43, 44, 45, 46, 47], [53, 54, 55, 56, 57], [63, 64, 65, 66, 67], [73, 74, 75, 76, 77], [83, 84, 85, 86, 87], [93, 94, 95, 96, 97]]
%C A032986 Using Macsyma Symbolic Software we can write: makelist( [6+i*10-10-3,6+i*10-10-2,6+i*10-10-1, 6+i*10-10, 6+i*10-10+1], i,2,n); (End)
