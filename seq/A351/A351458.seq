%N A351458 Numbers k for which k * gcd(sigma(k), A276086(k)) is equal to sigma(k) * gcd(k, A276086(k)), where A276086 is the primorial base exp-function, and sigma gives the sum of divisors of its argument.
%C A351458 Numbers k such that k * A324644(k) = A000203(k) * A324198(k).
%C A351458 Numbers k such that gcd(A064987(k), A324580(k)) = gcd(A064987(k), A351252(k)).
%C A351458 Numbers k such that their abundancy index [sigma(k)/k] is equal to A324644(k)/A324198(k). See A364286.
%C A351458 A324644 gives odd values for even numbers and for the odd squares. A324198 is odd on all arguments, therefore on odd squares the above equation reduces to odd * odd = odd * odd, and on odd nonsquares as odd * even = even * odd. It is an open question whether there are any odd terms after the initial a(1)=1.
%C A351458 If k is even, but not a multiple of 3, then A276086(k) is a multiple of 3, but not even (i.e., is an odd multiple of 3). If for such k also sigma(k) = 3*k, then A007949(A324644(k)) = min(A007949(sigma(k)), A007949(A276086(k))) = 1, while A007949(A324198(k)) = min(A007949(k), A007949(A276086(k))) = 0, therefore all such k's do occur in this sequence, for example, the two known terms of A005820 (3-perfect numbers) that are not multiples of three: 459818240, 51001180160, but also any hypothetical term of A005820 of the form 4u+2, where 2u+1 is not multiple of 3, and which by necessity is then also an odd perfect number.
%C A351458 Similarly, of the 65 known 5-multiperfect numbers (A046060), those 20 that are not multiples of five are included in this sequence. Note that all 65 are multiples of six.
%C A351458 It is conjectured that the intersection of this sequence with the multiperfect numbers (A007691) gives A323653, see comments in the latter.
%C A351458 For all even terms k of this sequence, A007814(A000203(k)) = A007814(k), sigma preserves the 2-adic valuation, and A007949(A000203(k)) >= A007949(k), i.e., does not decrease the 3-adic valuation. The condition is equivalence (=) when k is a multiple of 6. With odd terms, any hypothetical odd perfect number x would yield a one greater 2-adic valuation for sigma(x) than for x, but would satisfy the main condition of this sequence. - Corrected Feb 17 2022
%C A351458 If k is a nonsquare positive odd number (in A088828), then it must be a term of A191218. - _Antti Karttunen_, Mar 10 2024
