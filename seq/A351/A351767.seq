%N A351767 The "clockwork compass" sequence is a set of instructions which, given to a basic plotter, will print the sequence itself (see Comments and Example sections).
%C A351767 All terms begin either with 12, 3, 6 or 9 because this first part of the term indicates to the plotter in which direction the next unit-segment will be printed [12 stands for North (or Up), 3 stands for East (or Right), 6 for South (or Down) and 9 for West (or Left)]; the second part of the term is the number of unit-segments that must be printed in the chosen direction (122 asks the plotter to print in direction North a 2-unit segment for instance).
%C A351767 A negative term moves the plotter's write head in the desired direction and by a certain number of unit-segments, but nothing is printed or erased.
%C A351767 The author hopes that this is the lexicographically earliest sequence of its kind.

%e A351767 a(1) = 31 asks to print horizontally towards East a unit-segment;
%e A351767 a(2) = -31 moves the plotter write head horizontally from there towards East again, but nothing is printed;
%e A351767 a(3) = 62 asks to print vertically from there towards South a 2-unit segment; etc.
%e A351767 When a(11) = 121 is completed, the first integer of the sequence (31) will appear (on paper or on screen).
%e A351767 The digit-design which was selected by the author is visible hereunder (another digit-design would have produced a completely different sequence).
