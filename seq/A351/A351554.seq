%N A351554 Numbers k such that there are no odd prime factors p of sigma(k) such that p does not divide A003961(k) and the valuation(k, p) is different from valuation(sigma(k), p), where A003961 is fully multiplicative with a(p) = nextprime(p), and sigma is the sum of divisors function.
%C A351554 Numbers k for which A351555(k) = 0. This is a necessary condition for the terms of A349169 and of A349745, therefore they are subsequences of this sequence.
%C A351554 All six known 3-perfect numbers (A005820) are included in this sequence.
%C A351554 All 65 known 5-multiperfects (A046060) are included in this sequence.
%C A351554 Moreover, all multiperfect numbers (A007691) seem to be in this sequence.
%C A351554 From _Antti Karttunen_, Aug 27 2025: (Start)
%C A351554 Multiperfect number m is included in this sequence only if its abundancy sigma(m)/m has only such odd prime factors p that prevprime(p) [A151799] divides m for each p.  E.g., all 65 known 5-multiperfects are multiples of 3, and all known terms of A005820 and A046061 are even.
%C A351554 This sequence contains natural numbers k such that the odd primes in the prime factorization of sigma(k) have the same valuation there as in k, except that the primes in A003961(k) [or equally in A003961(A007947(k))] stand for "don't care primes", that are "masked off" from the comparison.
