%N A194703 Triangle read by rows: T(k,m) = number of occurrences of k in the last section of the set of partitions of (3 + m).
%C A194703 Sub-triangle of A182703 and also of A194812. Note that the sum of every row is also the number of partitions of 3. For further information see A182703 and A135010.
%F A194703 T(k,m) = A182703(3+m,k), with T(k,m) = 0 if k > 3+m.
%F A194703 T(k,m) = A194812(3+m,k).

%e A194703 ...
%e A194703 For k = 1 and m = 1, T(1,1) = 3 because there are three parts of size 1 in the last section of the set of partitions of 4, since 3 + m = 4, so a(1) = 3.
%e A194703 For k = 2 and m = 1, T(2,1) = 2 because there are two parts of size 2 in the last section of the set of partitions of 4, since 3 + m = 4, so a(2) = 2.
%Y A194703 Always the sum of row k = p(3) = A000041(3) = 3.
