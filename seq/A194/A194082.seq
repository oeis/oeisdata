%C A194082 Comment from _R. J. Mathar_, Dec 02 2012 (Start):
%C A194082 a(n-1) is the number of unit squares regularly packed into the isosceles triangle of edge length n.
%C A194082 The triangle may be aligned with the Cartesian axes by putting its bottom edge on the horizontal axis, so its vertices are at (x,y) = (0,0), (n,0) and (n/2,sqrt(3)*n/2), see A010527.
%C A194082 The area inside the triangle is sqrt(3)*n^2/4 = A120011*n^2. There is an obvious upper limit of floor(sqrt(3)*n^2/4) = A171971(n) to the count of non-overlapping unit squares inside this triangle.
%C A194082 Regular packing: We place the first row of unit squares so they touch the bottom edge of the triangle. Their number is limited by the length of the horizontal section of the line y=1 inside the triangle, n-2*y/sqrt(3), which touches all of these first-row squares at their top.
%C A194082 The number of unit squares in the next row, between y=1 and y=2, is limited by the length of the horizontal section of the line y=2 inside the triangle, n-2*y/sqrt(3). Continuing, in row y=1, 2, ... we insert floor(n-2*y/sqrt(3)) unit squares, all with the same orientation.
%C A194082 The total number of squares is sum_{ y=1, 2, ..., floor(n*sqrt(3)/2) } floor( n-2*y/sqrt(3) ), and resummation yields, up to an index shift, this sequence here.
