%N A194584 Differences of A035336.
%C A194584 It appears that this is the Fibonacci word A003849, using 5's and 3's instead of 0's and 1's. In other words, {a(n)} is a fixed point of the morphism 5->53, 3->5.
%C A194584 Proof of this conjecture: since A035336(n) = (2*floor(n*phi) + n - 1) (with phi = (1+sqrt(5))/2) is a generalized Beatty sequence, this follows from Lemma 4 in Allouche and Dekking. - _Michel Dekking_, Oct 10 2018
%C A194584 Also differences of A089910. - _Bob Selcoe_, Sep 20 2014
%C A194584 Proof of this conjecture: this follows from the Carlitz-Scoville-Hoggatt theorem: compositions of the Wythoff A and B sequences are generalized Beatty sequences (cf. Theorem 1 in Allouche and Dekking). - _Michel Dekking_, Oct 10 2018
