%N A194278 Total number of polygons after n-th stage in the D-toothpick structure of A194270.
%C A194278 The structure of the D-toothpick cellular automaton contains at least several tens of different types of polygons. For more information see A194276 and A194277.

%e A194278 Consider the structure with toothpicks of length 2 and D-toothpicks of length sqrt(2). After 3 stages the number of polygons in the structure is equal to 0. After 4 stages there are 2 hexagons, each with area = 6, so a(4) = 2. After 5 stages there are new 6 polygons: 2 hexagons, each with area = 8 and also 2 octagons, each with area = 14, so a(5) = 2+6 = 8.
