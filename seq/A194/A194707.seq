%N A194707 Triangle read by rows: T(k,m) = number of occurrences of k in the last section of the set of partitions of (7 + m).
%C A194707 Sub-triangle of A182703 and also of A194812. Note that the sum of every row is also the number of partitions of 7. For further information see A182703 and A135010.
%F A194707 T(k,m) = A182703(7+m,k), with T(k,m) = 0 if k > 7+m.
%F A194707 T(k,m) = A194812(7+m,k).

%e A194707 ...
%e A194707 For k = 1 and  m = 1; T(1,1) = 15 because there are 15 parts of size 1 in the last section of the set of partitions of 8, since 7 + m = 8, so a(1) = 15. For k = 2 and m = 1; T(2,1) = 8 because there are eight parts of size 2 in the last section of the set of partitions of 8, since 7 + m = 8, so a(2) = 8.
