%N A053034 Length of sequence when A051953 (cototient function) is repeatedly applied starting with n!.
%C A053034 The iteration is much slower than the analog for the divisor function; this sequence is not monotonic, cf. A053475.
%F A053034 a(n)-1 is the smallest number such that Nest[cototient, n!, a(n)]=0, the fixed point.
%e A053034 n=8: initial value = 8! = 40320; the successive iterates when cototient is iterated are {40320, 31104, 20736, 13824, 9216, 6144, 4096, 2048, 1024, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 0}. Observe the parameters: length=20, cototient was applied 19 times, number of initial non-powers of 2 is 6 and 0 is the 7th, while 13 terminal powers of 2 did arise: 4096, ..., 2, 1.
