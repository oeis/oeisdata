%N A053614 Numbers that are not the sum of distinct triangular numbers.
%C A053614 The Mathematica program first computes A024940, the number of partitions of n into distinct triangular numbers. Then it finds those n having zero such partitions. It appears that A024940 grows exponentially, which would preclude additional terms in this sequence. - _T. D. Noe_, Jul 24 2006, Jan 05 2009

%F A053614 Complement of A061208.
%e A053614 a(2) = 5: the 7 partitions of 5 are 5, 4+1, 3+2, 3+1+1, 2+2+1, 2+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1. Among those the distinct ones are 5, 4+1, 3+2. None contains all distinct triangular numbers.
%e A053614 12 is a term as it is not a sum of 1, 3, 6 or 10 taken at most once.
