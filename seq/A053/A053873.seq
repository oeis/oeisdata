%N A053873 Numbers n such that OEIS sequence A_n contains n.
%C A053873 A number n is in this sequence iff n appears anywhere in the terms of A_n, not just in the terms that are visible in the entry.
%C A053873 Is 53873 in this sequence? (A rhetorical question!) - _Tanya Khovanova_, Aug 09 2007
%C A053873 Is 53169 in this sequence? (A rhetorical question!). - _Raymond Wang_, Oct 07 2008
%C A053873 I skipped 241 since it appears that A000241(14) > 241, but as the 13th and further terms are not known this is not certain. The next term in the sequence is almost surely 319, but finding the least k for which A000319(k) = 319 requires calculating a chaotic sequence to high precision. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Jul 20 2007
%C A053873 241 is not in this sequence, since A000241(13) <= 225 and A000241(14) >= 0.8594*315 (see comments in A000241). - _Danny Rorabaugh_, Mar 13 2015
