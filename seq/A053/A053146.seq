%N A053146 When cototient function (A051953) is iterated with initial value A002110(n), a(n) = number of iterates that are not powers of 2.
%C A053146 In these iteration chains, the numbers that are not powers of 2 seem to be in the majority.
%e A053146 n=6, A002110(6)=30030; the corresponding iteration chain is: {30030, 24270, 17806, 9238, 4798, 2400, 1760, 1120, 736, 384, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 0}. It has 20 terms, among which entries from the first to 10th, also the last 0, are not powers of 2, so a(6)=11.
%Y A053146 Cf. A002110, A051953.
