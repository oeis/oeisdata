%N A053476 Smallest number m such that when A051953 is applied n times to m the result is neither a power of 2 nor 0.
%C A053476 An analog for A000005 is A049117.
%F A053476 Applying cototient-function A051953 n+1 times to a(n), a power of 2 or 0 appears; a(n) is the smallest with this property.
%e A053476 a(6)=330 and the iteration of A051953 applied to 330 gives sequence {330,250,150,110,70,46,24,16,8,4,2,1,0}. Six iterations result in the 6th term 24 which still is neither a power of 2 nor 0. For smaller numbers than 330 these 6 iterations yield a power of 2 or the fixed number 0.
%Y A053476 Cf. A051953, see also its iterates.
