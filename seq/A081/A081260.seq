%N A081260 a(1)=4; for n>1, a(n) is taken to be the third-smallest integer greater than a(n-1) such that the condition "n is a member of the sequence if and only if a(n) is odd" is satisfied.

%e A081260 a(1)=4, implying that the fourth term is the first odd member of the sequence; hence a(2) and a(3) are even. The third-smallest even integer greater than 4 is 10; therefore a(2)=10. The third-smallest integers that can satisfy the given condition if taken as a(3) and a(4) are 16 and 21, respectively.
