%N A101273 Theorems from propositional calculus, translated into decimal digits.
%C A101273 Blocks of 1s and 2s are variables: A = 1, B = 2, C = 11, D = 12, E = 21, ... Not = 3; And = 4; Xor = 5; Or = 6; Implies = 7; Equiv = 8; Left Parenthesis = 9; Right Parenthesis = 0.
%C A101273 Operator binding strength is in numerical order, Not > And > ... > Equiv.
%C A101273 The non-associative "Implies" is evaluated from Left to Right; A->B->C = is interpreted (A->B)->C. Redundant parentheses are permitted.
%C A101273 This is a decimal Goedelization of theorems from a particular axiomatization of propositional calculus. This should be linked to the subsequences of theorems and antitheorems. - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Dec 19 2004 [This comment is referring to A100200 and A101248. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, May 19 2020]
%C A101273 Comment from _Charles R Greathouse IV_, May 17 2020: (Start)
%C A101273 Each positive integer represents a string of one or more symbols, as described above. Some represent well-formed formulas. Of those, some are theorems (A101273) while others are antitheorems (A100200) with the remaining wffs in A101248. The first few theorems are
%C A101273 171, A -> A
%C A101273 181, A <-> A
%C A101273 272, B -> B
%C A101273 282, B <-> B
%C A101273 1531, A XOR ~A,
%C A101273 with 1 = A, 7 = ->, etc. (End)
%C A101273 In short: any well-formed formula (wff) can be mapped to an integer. The sequence lists those integers that correspond to wff's that are theorems. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, May 19 2020
