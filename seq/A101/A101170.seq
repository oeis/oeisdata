%N A101170 a(n) divides the number formed by concatenating the sum of the digits of a(n) with a(n).
%C A101170 The most common factor is 11, which catches most of the trivial cases such as 5000 (which when concatenated with its digit sum yields 55000... 11 * 5000). See A101171 for the first sequence member which uses a new factor.
%C A101170 There are only a finite number of terms ending with a nonzero digit. See A101171 for the proof. [From _Max Alekseyev_, May 08 2009]
%e A101170 a(50)=1125 because the number formed by concatenating the digit sum of 1125 (9) with 1125 yields a number (91125) that 1125 evenly divides. 91125 / 1125 = 81.
