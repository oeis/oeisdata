%N A101364 In the interior of a regular n-gon with all diagonals drawn, the number of points where exactly four diagonals intersect.
%C A101364 When n is odd, there are no intersections in the interior of an n-gon where more than 2 diagonals meet.
%C A101364 When n is not a multiple of 6, there are no intersections in the interior of an n-gon where more than 3 diagonals meet except the center.
%C A101364 When n is not a multiple of 30, there are no intersections in the interior of an n-gon where more than 5 diagonals meet except the center.
%C A101364 I checked the following conjecture up to n=210: "An n-gon with n=30k has 5n points where 6 or 7 diagonals meet and no interior point other than the center where more than 7 diagonals meet; If k is odd, then 6 diagonals meet in each of 4n points and 7 diagonals meet in each of n points; If k is even, then no groups of exactly 6 diagonals meet in a point, while exactly 7 diagonals meet in each of 5n points (all points interior excluding the center)."
