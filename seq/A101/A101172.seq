%N A101172 Sequence whose Mobius transform leads to the first differences of the terms.
%C A101172 In the example, the last value in the Mobius transform of [1,2,3,5,8] is 7 and so the next term in our sequence is 8+7=15. Then, the Mobius transform of [1,2,3,5,8,15] is [1,1,2,3,7,11], which means that the next term of our sequence is 15+11=26, etc.
%e A101172 For example, the Mobius transform of the segment [1,2,3,5,8] begins [1,1,2,3], which are the first differences of these terms.
