%N A101641 Positive integers n for which n = f(n), where f(n) is the total number of 4's required when writing out all numbers between 0 and n.
%C A101641 Related to a problem posed by Google and discussed on the MathWorld link.
%C A101641 Together with the b-file, this gives the complete list of all 47 positive numbers n such that n is equal to the number of 4's in the decimal digits of all numbers <= n. - Daniel Hirschberg (dan(AT)ics.uci.edu), May 05 2007

%F A101641 a(n) = 499999983 + n, n <= 10; a(n) = 500000000, n = 11
%e A101641 a(1) = 499999984, since writing out all numbers from 0 to 499999984 requires that 499999984 4's be used and since 499999984 is the first such positive integer.
%e A101641 a(4)=499999987 because the number of 4's in the decimal digits of the numbers from 1 to 499999987 is 499999987 and this is the 4th such number.
