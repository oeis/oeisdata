%N A101036 Riesel numbers n (n*2^k-1 is composite for all k>0, n odd) that have a covering set.
%C A101036 Conjecture: there are infinitely many Riesel numbers that do not arise from a covering system. See page 16 of the Filaseta et al. reference. - _Arkadiusz Wesolowski_, Nov 17 2014
%C A101036 a(1) = 509203 is also the smallest odd n for which either n^p*2^k - 1 or abs(n^p - 2^k) is composite for every k > 0 and every prime p > 3. - _Arkadiusz Wesolowski_, Oct 12 2015
%C A101036 Theorem 11 of Filaseta et al. gives a Riesel number which is thought to violate the assumption of a periodic sequence of prime divisors mentioned in the title of this sequence. - _Jeppe Stig Nielsen_, Mar 16 2019
%C A101036 If the Riesel number mentioned in the previous comment does in fact not have a covering set, then this sequence is different from A076337, because then that number, 3896845303873881175159314620808887046066972469809^2, is a term of A076337, but not of this sequence. - _Felix Fröhlich_, Sep 09 2019
%C A101036 Named after the Swedish mathematician Hans Ivar Riesel (1929-2014). - _Amiram Eldar_, Jun 20 2021
%C A101036 Conjecture: if R is a Riesel number (that has a covering set), then there exists a prime P such that R^p is also a Riesel number for every prime p > P. - _Thomas Ordowski_, Jul 12 2022
%C A101036 Problem: are there numbers K such that K + 2^m is a Riesel number for every m > 0? If so, then (K + 2^m)*2^n - 1 is composite for every pair of positive integers m,n. Also, by the dual Riesel conjecture, |K + 2^m - 2^n| are always composite. Note that, by the dual Riesel conjecture, if p is an odd prime and n is a positive integer, then there exists n such that (p + 2^m)*2^n - 1 is prime. So if such a number K exists, it must be composite. - _Thomas Ordowski_, Jul 20 2022
