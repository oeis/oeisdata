%C A073822 Is anything known about the properties of this number? - Edray Herber Goins (ehgoins(AT)mac.com), Jun 27 2004
%C A073822 Wolf (2010), in addition to prime numbers, also ponders continued fractions from the factorials (f) and from the Fibonacci numbers (F), remarking that "both f and F also should be transcendental but we are not aware of the proof of this fact," and that the Davenport-Roth theorem is of no help. - _Alonso del Arte_, Mar 06 2012
