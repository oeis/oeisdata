%N A073316 a(n) = Max d(j), j=1..n-1, where d(j) is the smallest positive number such that 2j+d(j) and 2n+d(j) are both prime. A generalization of A073310.
%C A073316 Conjecture: a(n) < 2n. Note that the truth of this conjecture implies that for any pair of positive even numbers e1 < e2 <= 2n, there is a positive odd number d < 2n such that e1+d and e2+d are primes. Note that this conjecture can also be stated with odd and even swapped: for any pair of positive odd numbers d1 < d2 < 2n, there is a positive even number e <= 2n such that e+d1 and e+d2 are primes. Also note that proving this conjecture would prove the twin primes conjecture.
%C A073316 This is equivalent to a conjecture by Erdős mentioned by _R. K. Guy_ at the end of section C1 of his book. The conjecture has been verified for n < 10^5. - _T. D. Noe_, Nov 04 2007
