%N A073609 a(0) = 2; a(n) for n > 0 is the smallest prime greater than a(n-1) that differs from a(n-1) by a square.
%C A073609 For n > 2, a(n) must be of the form 36k + 11. This is seen by induction since 36k + 11 + m^2 is even if m is odd and since 36k + 11 + (6m + 2)^2 and 36k + 11 + (6m + 4)^2 are both divisible by 3. - _Gerald McGarvey_, Jun 03 2007

%e A073609 After 3, we skip over 5 because 5 - 3 = 2, which is not a square, but 7 - 3 = 4 = 2^2, so 7 follows 3 in the sequence.
%e A073609 11 is the next prime after 7 and it differs from 7 by 4, so 11 follows 7 in the sequence.
%e A073609 47 differs from 11 by 36 = 6^2 and no prime between 11 and 47 differs from 11 by a square, so 47 is the next term after 11.
