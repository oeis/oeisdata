%N A073860 Smallest primes such that every partial sum is an n-th power.
%C A073860 The sequence is complete. Proof: We must find a prime p and an integer x such that p = x^6 - (2+7+503+1889+30367) = x^6 - 32768 = (x^2-32)*(x^4+32*x^2+1024). Since p is prime, we must have p=1*p, therefore we can only have x=sqrt(33) to make p = (1)*(3169). However, sqrt(33) is not an integer. Therefore we can conclude that there is no prime p satisfying the equation. - Francois Jooste (pin(AT)myway.com), Mar 09 2003
%F A073860 a(n) = x^n - sum(a(i), i=1..n-1), for some integer x and a(n) prime for all n. - Francois Jooste (pin(AT)myway.com), Mar 09 2003
%e A073860 a(3) = 503, 2+7+503 = 512=8^3.
