%N A073546 Triangle read by rows: row n gives denominators of n distinct unit fractions (or Egyptian fractions) summing to 1, where denominators are listed in increasing order and the largest denominator is smallest possible.
%C A073546 From _Sean A. Irvine_, Dec 05 2024: (Start)
%C A073546 For better versions of this sequence see A216993 and A378723.
%C A073546 This sequence is retained because of the terms given in the Brown link.
%C A073546 There can be more the one solution with the same smallest maximum denominator. For example, if n=8, we have:
%C A073546 1/3 + 1/5 + 1/9 + 1/10 + 1/12 + 1/15 + 1/18 + 1/20 = 1,
%C A073546 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6 + 1/9 + 1/10 + 1/15 + 1/18 + 1/20 = 1.
%C A073546 The definition of this sequence does not specify which of these should be retained and various rows given here are not consistent in their selection. In A378723, the second solution is taken because 10 < 12 when reading the denominators from the right. In A216993, the first solution is taken because 3 < 4 when reading the denominators from the left. (End)
