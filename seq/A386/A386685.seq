%N A386685 Classification of the interval [4*n+1, 4*n+2, 4*n+3] according to positions of primes.
%C A386685 The maximum run of squarefree numbers is 3, since 4*n is nonsquarefree. Because of this, we may classify the n-th interval according to which numbers, 4*n+1, 4*n+2, or 4*n+3, are squarefree. Since a number is either squarefree or not, there 2^3 possibilities, hence 8 classes. The sequence that employs this classification methodology is A063736; this sequence borrows Labos' classification in A063736 but ignores composites and the number 1.

%e A386685 a(0) = 3 since, for n = 0, 4*n+1 = 1, 4*n+2 = 2, and 4*n+3 = 3, only the last 2 are prime, thus we have the binary number 011_2 = 3. Since 2 is the only even prime, there exists no other n > 0 such that a(n) is in {2, 3, 6, 7}.
%e A386685 a(1) = 5 since, for n = 1, 4*n+1 = 5, 4*n+2 = 6, and 4*n+3 = 7, the first and last are prime, thus we have the binary number 101_2 = 5.
%e A386685 a(2) = 1 since, for n = 2, 4*n+1 = 9, 4*n+2 = 10, and 4*n+3 = 11, only the last is prime, thus we have the binary number 001_2 = 1.
%e A386685 a(3) = 4 since, for n = 3, 4*n+1 = 13, 4*n+2 = 14, and 4*n+3 = 15, only the first is prime, thus we have the binary number 100_2 = 4.
%e A386685 a(6) = 0 since, for n = 6, 4*n+1 = 25, 4*n+2 = 26, and 4*n+3 = 27, none are prime, thus we have the binary number 000_2 = 0, etc.
