%N A386995 Primes p such that 2p-1 is a square and 2p+1 is also prime.
%C A386995 Might be called "Masser primes" after David Masser, who on December 29, 2025 sent me an email in which he found that 2025 is a square, the next year is 2026 = 2 * 1013, 1013 is a prime, and interestingly the year after 2026 is 2027, a prime. He also asked: (a) Find the next time this unlikely intersection occurs. (b) Assuming H prove that it occurs infinitely often. (where H can be a good joke :-))

%e A386995 5 is a term, since 2*5-1 = 9 is a square and 2*5+1 = 11 is a prime.
