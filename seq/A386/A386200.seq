%N A386200 Number of conjugacy classes of PSL(2,Z) of trace n, or 0 if infinitely many.
%C A386200 There are infinitely many conjugacy classes for n = 2 and finitely many for all other n.
%C A386200 An algorithm for computing a(n), n >= 3, is to enumerate k-tuples of pairs of positive integers, ((a_1,b_1),(a_2,b_2),...,(a_k,b_k)), with k < n that are lexicographically maximal under cyclic permutation, and to count those for which A^(a_1) B^(b_1) ... A^(a_k) B^(b_k) has trace n, where A = [[1,1],[0,1]] and B = [[1,0],[1,1]].
%C A386200 a(n) is related to the ideal class number of quadratic real fields of discriminant n^2 - 4.

%F A386200 If n is odd and d = n^2 - 4 is squarefree, then a(n) = -Sum(kronecker(n,r) * log(sin(Pi*r/d)) / log((n+sqrt(d))/2), where kronecker(n,r) is the Kronecker symbol. The expression (n + sqrt(d)) / 2 is eta(d), the fundamental unit of the quadratic field with squarefree discriminant d.
%e A386200 The elements of PSL(2,Z) of trace 0 are the elements of order 2, all of which are conjugate to [[0,1],[-1,0]].
%e A386200 The elements of trace 1 are the elements of order 3. They are conjugate either to [[0,1],[-1,1]] or to its inverse.
%e A386200 Apart from the identity, all other elements are of infinite order. There are infinitely many conjugacy classes of trace 2, the class of the identity and a family of classes indexed by a nonzero integer. Each of the latter contains exactly one nonzero power of [[1,1],[0,1]].
%e A386200 All elements of trace 3 are conjugate to [[2,1],[1,1]].
