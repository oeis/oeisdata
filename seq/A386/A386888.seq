%N A386888 Number of ways to write n as u + (1+(n mod 2))*v with v <= n/2, where u and v are both sums of three consecutive primes.
%C A386888 For m > 0, let P(m) denote the set of all sums of m consecutive primes. We make the following general conjecture motivated by Goldbach's conjecture.
%C A386888 Conjecture 1: Let k and m be positive integers.
%C A386888 (i) Each sufficiently large integer n == k + m (mod 2) can be written as p + q, where p and q belong to P(k) and P(m) respectively.
%C A386888 (ii) If k is odd, then every sufficiently large integer n == m (mod 2) can be written as 2*p + q, where p and q belong to P(k) and P(m) respectively.
%C A386888 In the case k = m = 3, we have the following concrete conjecture.
%C A386888 Conjecture 2: If n is an odd number greater than 905, or an even number greater than 1466, then we have a(n) > 0. Also, a(n) > 1 for all n > 2258. (Verified for n <= 5*10^5.)

%e A386888 a(20) = 1 since 20 = (2+3+5) + (2+3+5) and 2,3,5 are three consecutive primes.
%e A386888 a(35) = 1 since 35 = 2*(2+3+5) + (3+5+7), and both 2,3,5 and 3,5,7 are three consecutive primes.
%e A386888 a(100) = 1 since 100 = (11+13+17) + (17+19+23), and both 11,13,17 and 17,19,23 are three consecutive primes.
%e A386888 a(2119) = 1 since 2119 = 2*(193+197+199) + (311+313+317), and both 193,197,199 and 311,313,317 are three consecutive primes.
%e A386888 a(2258) = 1 since 2258 = (17+19+23) + (727+733+739) = (prime(7)+prime(8)+prime(9)) + (prime(129)+prime(130)+prime(131)).
