%N A386664 The number of ways of placing dominoes on an n X n board so that no two touch, and no additional domino can be placed to still satisfy that condition.
%C A386664 Calculated by constructing an undirected graph whose nodes correspond to placements of a domino where there is an edge between two dominoes that overlap or touch. This graph is then encoded into CNF with additional constraints to ensure maximality (if a node is not in the independent set then one of its neighbors must be), and given to the model counter ganak.

%e A386664 For n = 2, the 4 solutions contain one domino in any of the 4 valid positions.
%Y A386664 Cf. A145773 which is the same without the maximality condition.
