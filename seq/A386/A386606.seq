%N A386606 Numbers with exactly 3 distinct odd prime factors.
%C A386606 The cyclotomic polynomials Phi_a(n) (see A013595 and A013596, which are the same for n >= 4) of these numbers may contain coefficients as given in the irregular triangle A013595(a(n),m) (or A013596(a(n),m)), which are equal to 2 or -2. It seems that most of these numbers satisfy this condition. Counterexamples begin a(5) = 231, a(15) = 399, a(18) = 435 (see also A391069).
%C A386606 Some of the cyclotomic polynomials of these numbers contain coefficients which are in {-3, 3}; for example for a(n) = 1309, 1330 and 1463 with n = 119, 123 and 139 respectively, or even coefficients in {-4, 4} as for example for a(297) = 2431, or in {-5, 5} as in a(353) = 2717.
%F A386606 Equals Union_{k >= 0} 2^k*A278569; i.e., A278569 is the subsequence of all odd terms in this sequence.
%e A386606 390 is a term since 390 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 13 has exactly 3 odd prime factors (3,5,13).
%e A386606 525 is a term since 525 = 3 * 5^2 * 7 has exactly 3 odd prime factors (3,5,7).
