%N A270969 Number of ways to write n as w^4 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2, where w, x, y and z are nonnegative integers with x <= y <= z.
%C A270969 Theorem: a(n) > 0 for all n = 0,1,2,.... In other words, any nonnegative integer can be written as the sum of a fourth power and three squares.
%C A270969 This is stronger than Lagrange's four-square theorem, and it can be proved by induction on n. It is easy to check that a(n) > 0 for all n = 0..16. Now let n be an integer greater than 16, and assume that a(m) > 0 for all m = 0..n-1. If 16|n, then n/16 can be written as w^4+x^2+y^2+z^2 with w,x,y,z integers, and hence n = (2w)^4+(4x)^2+(4y)^2+(4z)^2. If n == 8 (mod 16), then n is not of the form 4^k*(8q+7) and hence n = 0^4+x^2+y^2+z^2 for some integers x,y,z. If n == 4 (mod 8), then n-1^4 can be written as the sum of three squares. If n == 2 (mod 4), then n-0^4 is a sum of three squares. If n == 7 (mod 8), then n-1^4 can be written as the sum of three squares. If n is odd but not congruent to 7 modulo 8, then n-0^4 can be expressed as the sum of three squares.
%C A270969 We have a(n) = 1 if n has the form 16^k*q with k a nonnegative integer and q among 7, 8, 15, 23, 31, 47, 71, 79. In fact, if n = 16*m with m > 0, and 16*m = w^4+x^2+y^2+z^2 with w,x,y,z integers, then w,x,y,z are all even and hence m = (w/2)^4+(x/2)^2+(y/2)^2+(z/2)^2. Therefore a(16*m) = a(m) for all m > 0. It is easy to check that a(q) = 1 for every q = 7, 8, 15, 23, 31, 47, 71, 79.
%C A270969 For (a,b,c) = (1,1,2),(1,1,3),(1,1,4),(1,1,6),(1,2,2),(1,2,3),(1,2,4),(1,2,5), we are also able to show that any natural number can be written as w^4+a*x^2+b*y^2+c*z^2 with w,x,y,z integers.
%C A270969 Conjecture: For each triple (a,b,c) = (1,2,11),(1,2,12),(1,2,13),(2,3,5), any natural number can be written as w^4+a*x^2+b*y^2+c*z^2 with w,x,y,z integers.
