%N A270361 Odd primes p for which there exists an odd prime q < p such that p*q - 1 is a square.
%C A270361 Conjecture: For any odd prime p there is at most one odd prime q, with q < p, for which p*q-1 is square.
%C A270361 (Note: If p were not restricted to being prime, there could be multiple primes q which make p*q-1 a square, with increasing multiplicities for larger p. The upper limit on the multiplicity of solutions, for prime and nonprime p and q values, is given by A006278. Note, however that those limits allow for solutions where q=2, and therefore two solutions when p and q are prime.)
%C A270361 a(n) is a subsequence of the Pythagorean Primes (A002144), which are of the form 4k+1.
%C A270361 The density of a(n) values among the primes declines with increasing n. For example, a(n) is about 22% of the first 1000 primes, and drops to about 15% of "incremental" primes around prime(10000). The density continues to fall among even larger primes. Twice those percentages apply as a portion of A002144.
%C A270361 All values of q also belong to A002144. It appears the set of q values "intends to" fully comprise A002144. This is notable because p values comprise an increasingly sparse subsequence within A002144, and each p value has just one q value.
%C A270361 The ability to fully comprise A002144 with q values is further challenged by the fact that for any given q value (i.e., any term of A002144) multiple values of p > q can be found such that p*q-1 is square. Thus q values are "promiscuous", and apparently without bounds on the number of p values they can serve.
%C A270361 Contrast this with primes p and q such that p*q+1 is square. The result are the Twin Primes (A001359 and A006512), arranged in a simple one-to-one correspondence, with p = q+2.
