%N A226032 Numbers of the form xyz, where x and z have the same number of digits and x*z = y.
%C A226032 The same digit may not be used twice as both an "outer" and "inner" digit. For example, 11211 is not in the sequence, but 1112111 is.
%C A226032 Leading zeros are not allowed.

%e A226032 482 is in the sequence because 4*2 = 8.
%e A226032 4205 is in the sequence because 4*5 = 20.
%e A226032 100 is in the sequence because 1*0 = 0. However, 1200 is not because even though 12*0 = 0, 12 and 0 do not have the same number of digits. Likewise, 12|0|00 and 12|00|00 are not in the sequence because leading zeros are not allowed.
