%N A226133 Integers of the form (p*q-1)/24 where p < q are primes.
%C A226133 Results for p = q are given in A024702, which is complementary.
%C A226133 All integer results when viewed in the triangle occur in loosely diagonal, interrupted "bands" roughly (or exactly) parallel to main diagonal, such that q - p = 24m, where m = 1 for the first band closest to the main diagonal, m = 2 for the second band, m = 3 for the third band, etc.  The main diagonal p = q can be considered as fitting in this pattern where m = 0.
%C A226133 A general "rule" can be stated: If q-p = 24m for any m >= 0 and primes p < q, then p*q-1 is divisible by 24.  This follows algebraically from the known "rule" that p^2 - 1 is divisible by 24 for any prime p > 3 as given in A024702.
%C A226133 No result will occur twice, even when including A024702, because the product of any two primes is unique within the set.
%C A226133 Integer results have a density of about 12% to 13% for all possible p,q pairs among the first few hundred primes.
