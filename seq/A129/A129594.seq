%N A129594 Involution of nonnegative integers induced by the conjugation of the partition encoded in the run lengths of binary expansion of n.
%C A129594 This sequence is based on the fact that compositions (i.e. ordered partitions) can be mapped 1-to-1 to partitions by taking the partial sums of the list where one is subtracted from each composant except the first. (See table A227189 where the parts for each partition are listed).
%C A129594 The inverse process, from partitions to compositions, occurs by inserting the first (i.e. smallest) element of a partition sorted into ascending order to the front of the list obtained by adding one to the first differences of the elements.
%C A129594 Compositions map bijectively to nonnegative integers by assigning each run of k consecutive 1's (or 0's) in binary expansion of n with summand k in the composition.
%C A129594 The graph of this sequence is quite interesting.

%e A129594 a(8) = 11, as 8 is 1000 in binary, mapping to composition 3+1 (we scan the binary expansion from the least to the most significant end), which maps to partition 3+3, whose conjugate-partition is 2+2+2, yielding composition 2+1+1, which maps to binary 1011, 11 in decimal. a(13) = 14, as 13 is 1101 in binary, mapping to composition 1+1+2, which maps to the partition 1+1+2, whose conjugate-partition is 1+3, yielding composition 1+3, which maps to binary 1110, 14 in decimal. a(11) = 8 and a(14) = 13, as taking the conjugate of a partition is a self-inverse operation.

%Y A129594 Sequences related to partitions encoded in this way:
%Y A129594 Cf. A227189 (parts of partitions listed on separate rows of the array).
%Y A129594 Cf. A005811 (number of parts in the partition).
%Y A129594 Cf. A136480 (for n>= 1, the smallest part).
%Y A129594 Cf. A227185 (the largest part).
%Y A129594 Cf. A227183 (sum of parts).
%Y A129594 Cf. A227184 (product of parts).
%Y A129594 Note that this permutation maps between A005811 and A227185 as follows: A005811(n) = A227185(a(n)) and vice versa: A227185(n) = A005811(a(n)). On the other hand, it keeps A227183 fixed, as A227183(n) = A227183(a(n)).
