%N A129621 Primes p such that at least one of k-1 and k+1 is prime, where k = sum of the two neighboring primes of 3*p.
%e A129621 29*3 = 87, neighboring primes are 83 and 89 which sum to 172; 173 is prime, hence 29 is in the sequence.
%e A129621 31*3 = 93, neighboring primes are 89 and 97 which sum to 186; neither 185 nor 187 is prime, hence 31 is not in the sequence.
%e A129621 1091*3 = 3273, neighboring primes are 3271 and 3299 which sum to 6570; both 6569 and 6571 are prime, hence 1091 is in the sequence.
