%e A129128 The array is a tree structure as described by A128628. If a node value has only one branch the value is twice that of its parent node. If it has two branches one is twice that of its parent node but the other is adjusted as indicated below:
%e A129128 (1) pick an odd number (e.g. 135)
%e A129128 (2) calculate its prime factorization ( 135 = 5*3*3*3)
%e A129128 (3) note the least prime factor (LPF(135) = 3
%e A129128 (4) note the index of the LPF (index(3) = 2
%e A129128 (5) subtract one from the index (2-1 =1)
%e A129128 (6) calculate the prime associated with the value in step five (prime(1) = 2)
%e A129128 (7) The parent node generating the odd number 135 is (2/3)*135 = 90.
%e A129128 therefore 90 is a member of A129128
