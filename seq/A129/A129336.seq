%N A129336 Digital clock semiprimes.
%C A129336 Semiprime analog of A050246. Semiprimes possible on a 24-hour digital clock, with no seconds. The largest value is a(414) = 2359 = 7 * 337 because 23:59 is the largest 4-digit number that appears on a 24-hour digital clock.

%e A129336 253 is in the sequence because (see the comic) a character looks at a digital clock reading 2:53 and says: "253 is 11 x 23." That clock-time is a semiprime.
