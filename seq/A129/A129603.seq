%N A129603 Replace in the binary expansion of n each run of k 0's (or 1's) with 2k-1 0's (or 1's).
%e A129603 a(1) = 1, as 1 is 1 in binary and single runs stay intact (as 2*1 - 1 = 1). a(9) = 17, as 9 is 1001 in binary and keeping the most and the least significant runs as '1' and changing the center run '00' to '000', we get 10001 in binary, 17 in decimal.
