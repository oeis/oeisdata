%N A129520 Orders of symmetric groups associated with the exceptional groups G2, F4, E6, E7, E7.5, E8, E9 (or better? E11): A_3, S_3, A_4, S_5, "? ", A_5, S_5.
%C A129520 The calculation by hand based on dimensions of: Dim_Ex(i)-n(i)*Dim_Symm(i)=small_integer The groups E7.5 and E9 are better thought of as E7.6 and E11 when integer results are wanted. The "?" question mark group is a symmetrical group between s4 and A5 with dimension 40; it is not in any of the books I have or on the web as far as I can find by searching.
