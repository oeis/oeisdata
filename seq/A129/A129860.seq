%N A129860 Number of unrooted bifurcating tree shapes with n leaves.
%C A129860 Alternatively, the number of unrooted, unlabeled binary tree topologies with n leaves. - _Steven Kelk_, Jul 22 2016
%C A129860 This sequence is identical to A000672 (3-valent trees, boron trees, or binary trees) except the offset is different. A000672 is the main entry for this sequence and has much more information (including a b-file with many more terms). Thanks to _Steven Kelk_ for noticing the errors in the present sequence (which have now been corrected), and for discovering the connection with A000672. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jul 22 2016
