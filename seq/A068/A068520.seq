%N A068520 Numbers n which can be transformed into a true arithmetic statement by inserting zero or more parentheses and elementary arithmetic operators ((, ), +, -, *, /) and one equality sign (=) as the rightmost insertion into the decimal representation of n.
%C A068520 The minus sign is considered only as two-place infix operator, not as one-place prefix operator. Therefore -1 + 2 = 1 is not allowed and 121 is not a term.
%C A068520 For obvious reasons these numbers are called (elementary) "didactic numbers".

%e A068520 7 = 7; 1 * 0 = 0; 2 - 2 = 0; 2 / 2 = 1; 18 / 2 = 9; 2 * (3 + 4) = 14. Therefore 77, 100, 220, 221, 1829 and 23414 are terms of the sequence.
