%N A068088 n-3, n-2, n-1, n+1, n+2 and n+3 are squarefree.
%C A068088 No four consecutive numbers can all be squarefree, as one of them is divisible by 2^2 = 4.
%C A068088 From 28 to 44 there are 12 squarefree numbers among 15 consecutive integers. Other examples are 100 to 116 and 212 to 228.
%C A068088 The largest possible run of consecutive multiples of 4 in the sequence is 3: If n, n+4 and n+8 are in the sequence then n+4 and hence n-5 and n+13 must be divisible by 9, so neither n-4 nor n+12 can be in the sequence. - Ulrich Schimke, Apr 13 2002
