%N A068088 Numbers k such that k-3, k-2, k-1, k+1, k+2 and k+3 are squarefree.
%C A068088 No four consecutive numbers can all be squarefree, as one of them is divisible by 2^2 = 4.
%C A068088 From 28 to 44 there are 12 squarefree numbers among 15 consecutive integers. Other examples are 100 to 116 and 212 to 228.
%C A068088 The largest possible run of consecutive multiples of 4 in the sequence is 3: If k, k+4 and k+8 are in the sequence then k+4 and hence k-5 and k+13 must be divisible by 9, so neither k-4 nor k+12 can be in the sequence. - Ulrich Schimke, Apr 13 2002
