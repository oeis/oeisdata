%N A068994 Powers of 2 with all even digits.
%C A068994 The corresponding exponents are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 11.
%C A068994 Are there any more terms in this sequence?
%C A068994 Evidence that the sequence may be finite, from _Rick L. Shepherd_, Jun 23 2002:
%C A068994 1) The sequence of last two digits of 2^n, A000855 of period 20, makes clear that 2^n > 4 must have n == 3, 6, 10, 11, or 19 (mod 20) for 2^n to be a member of this sequence. Otherwise, either the tens digit (in 10 cases), as seen directly, or the hundreds digit, in the 5 cases receiving a carry from the previous power's tens digit >= 5, must be odd.
%C A068994 2) No additional term has been found for n up to 50000.
%C A068994 3) Furthermore, again for each n up to 50000, examining 2^n's digits leftward from the rightmost but only until an odd digit was found, it was only once necessary to search even to the 18th digit. This occurred for 2^12106 whose last digits are ...3833483966860466862424064. Note that 2^12106 has 3645 digits. (The clear runner-up, 2^34966, a 10526-digit number, required searching only to the 15th digit. Exponents for which only the 14th digit was reached were only 590, 3490, 8426, 16223, 27771, 48966 and 49519 - representing each congruence above.)
%C A068994 No additional terms up to 2^100000. - _Harvey P. Dale_, Dec 25 2012
%C A068994 No additional terms up to 2^(10^10). - _Michael S. Branicky_, Apr 16 2023
%C A068994 No additional terms up to 2^(10^11). See C program in links. It was only necessary to check the rightmost 40 digits of each power. But for going towards 10^12, 40 digits won't suffice. - _Lukas Huwald_, Mar 20 2025
%C A068994 No additional terms up to 2^(10^13). See second C program in links. The champions in this range are 2^133477987019 with 46 even last digits and 2^9780164740006 with 45 even last digits. - _Fredrik Johansson_, Mar 21 2025
%C A068994 No additional terms up to 2^(10^17). See Go program in links which uses a strong sieve to accelerate the computation substantially. - _Ted E Dunning_, Mar 31 2025
