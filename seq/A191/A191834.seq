%N A191834 Numbers n not divisible by 2 or 3 such that k^k == k+1 (mod n) has no nonzero solutions.
%C A191834 Values of A007310(n) for n such that A191833(n) = 0.
%C A191834 This sequence contains no primes. If p is a prime, and r is a primitive root of p, the numbers (r+j*p)^(r+j*p) for j = 1..p-1 include all residues of units mod p, and for p > 3, r+1 must be a unit.
%C A191834 The complete list of n such that k^k == k+1 (mod n) has no nonzero solutions is the union of A047229 and this sequence.
