%N A191612 Image of A008578 (the noncomposite numbers) under the "forming" transformation.
%C A191612 We define a transformation T_f [b(n)] = [c(n)] - the index f means "forming" - of an increasing sequence b(n) of integers b(1), b(2), b(3), ..., b(k) which produces an increasing sequence c(n) of the same length, c(1), c(2), c(3), ..., c(k) such that c(1) = b(1), and for j>1, c(j) is the only integer b(j-1) < c(j) <= b(j), with (b(j)-b(j-1)) | c(j). We say b(n) is forming c(n).
%C A191612 An increasing sequence c(n) is called formed from the increasing sequence b(n) by T_f [b(n)] when there is an increasing sequence b(n) such that b(1) = c(1), for j > 1, b(j) is an integer c(j) <= b(j) < c(j+1) such that difference b(j) - b(j-1) divides c(j).
%C A191612 This transformation T_invf [c(n)] is an inverse of T_f [b(n)], but this inversion of c(n) back to b(n) may not be unique, and there are also increasing sequences c(n) which do not have an image T_invf [c(n)]. We call the latter sequences c(n) "unformed."
%C A191612 Each increasing sequences b(n) can be transform by transformation T_f [b(n)] but this does not apply to transformation T_invf [b(n)]. An increasing sequence c(n) is called totally formed if c(n) = T_f [c(n)] = T_invf [c(n)]. Each totally formed sequence is formed.
%C A191612 There are infinitely many formed, totally formed and unformed increasing sequences.
%C A191612 Examples of totally formed sequences: A047229, A004277, A002808, A000079, A000027.
%C A191612 Examples of formed, but not totally formed, sequences: A000225, A000295, A018252.
%C A191612 Examples of unformed sequences: A000040, A008578, A005117, A005408.
%F A191612 For n > 3, a(n) = A113709(n-2).
%e A191612 a(10) = 20 because 20 is the only integer such that 19 = A008578(9) < 20 <= A008578(10) = 23 and simultaneously is multiple of difference A008578(10) - A008578(9) = 4.
