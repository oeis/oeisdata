%N A191322 Number of bases in which both n and the reversal of n are 3-digit numbers.
%F A191322 a(n)=a(inv(n)); a(A002113(n))=A191291(A002113(n)); a(n)<=min(A191291(n),A191291(inv(n)).
%e A191322 a(36)=3 since 36 is 3-digit number in bases 4,5,6 and 63 is 3-digit number in bases 4,5,6,7 such that we have 3 common bases.
