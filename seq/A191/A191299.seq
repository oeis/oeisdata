%N A191299 List of integers in Pynchon's "Gravity's Rainbow".
%C A191299 Integers, in order (up to and including p. 36) appearing in the 1973 novel "Gravity's Rainbow".
%C A191299 Rules: In order to avoid confusion with rational numbers, numbers in strings less representative of entire isolated integers (e.g. "6:43:16 BDST", p. 29), single-quotation-mark-truncated integers (e.g. " '37 ", p. 20, as opposed to "1937"), etc., we begin by establishing the following rules:
%C A191299 (i) The integers cannot be connected to non-space-characters except if: the integer is immediately followed by a period then a space, or a comma then a space, or a question mark then a space, or an exclamation point then a space, or a colon then a space, or a semicolon then a space, or a closing bracket, or a double quotation mark (but not a single quotation mark, e.g. "86'd" p. 22); or except if an opening bracket immediately precedes the integer, or if a double quotation mark (but not a single quotation mark, given the truncation concern indicated above) immediately precedes the integer; integers may be concatenated using "-".
%C A191299 (ii) Integers containing a comma such as "50,000" (p. 85) are allowed.
%C A191299 (iii) These numbers cannot be written using characters of the alphabet, e.g. "Zero" (p. 1), or "World War II" (p. 17).
%C A191299 (iv) The page numbers and chapter numbers of the book are not included (although the corresponding page numbers are indicated below).
%C A191299 (v) Integers appearing in equations are included.
%C A191299 (End of Rules)
