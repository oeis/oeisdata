%N A344378 Positive integers m for which there exists a positive even integer 2k such that Sum_{j=1..m} j^(2k) has no prime divisor smaller than 2*m + 3.
%C A344378 a(n)*(a(n)+1)*(2a(n)+1) must be squarefree, so this is a subsequence of A172186. It is the complement of A344380 in A172186.
%C A344378 Let L= LCM_j[(p_j-1)/2], where p_j run through the set of the prime divisors of  a(n)*(a(n)+1)*(2a(n)+1). For a given member a(n) any admissible k must be a multiple of L, and for any prime p smaller than a(n) such that (p-1)/2 divides L, it holds that p does not divide a(n)-Floor[a(n)/p]. But the converse is not true: 397 is squarefree and satisfies the former condition, but Sum_{j=1..397} j^(2k) is always divisible either by 17 or by 73. 397 is the smallest "false positive" with the above test. Other "false positives" are rather scarce: 397,469,478,561,885,1002,1554,1658,1702,1977,... - _René Gy_, Apr 15 2025

%e A344378 2 belongs to the sequence since 1 + 2^(2*2) = 17 is a prime number which is larger than 2*2 + 1 = 5.
%e A344378 5 belongs to the sequence because 1 + 2^20 + 3^20 + 4^20 + 5^20 = 96470431101379 = 137*704163730667 has no prime divisor smaller than 2*5 + 3 = 13.
