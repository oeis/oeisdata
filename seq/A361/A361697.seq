%N A361697 The least y-value of the lower left corner of an n X n box with x-value n such that no edge of the box overlaps with a previous box, given that the first box has its lower left corner at (1,1).
%C A361697 The sequence is defined by the following method: Draw a 1 X 1 box with lower left corner at (1,1) on the coordinate grid. Then, for all integers n greater than 1, a(n) is the smallest positive integer value such that an n X n box with lower left coordinate (n, a(n)) has no edges that overlap with other boxes.
%C A361697 A029744 appears to be the terms for which a(n)=n in this sequence.
