%N A361209 Second hexagonal numbers having middle divisors.
%C A361209 The middle divisors of n are the divisors in the half-open interval [sqrt(n/2), sqrt(n*2)).
%C A361209 Also numbers k with the property that in the symmetric representation of sigma(k) the smallest Dyck path has a central peak and the largest Dyck path has a central valley and both Dyck paths do not meet in the center.
%e A361209 36 is in the sequence because it is a second hexagonal number (A014105) and it has a middle divisor, the 6.
%e A361209 On the other hand the 35th row of A237593 is [18,7,3,2,2,1,2,2,1,2,2,3,7,18] and the 36th row of the same triangle is [19,6,4,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,4,6,19]. Since the smallest Dyck path of the symmetric representation of sigma(36) has a central peak and the largest Dyck path has a central valley and both Dyck paths do not meet in the center so 36 is in the sequence. The diagram is too large to include.
