%N A361606 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of distinct positive numbers such that, for n > 3, a(n) shares a factor with a(n-1) and a(n-2) but not with a(n-1) + a(n-2).
%C A361606 All terms must contain two or more distinct prime factors. If a(n) was a prime power then a(n+1) would contain the same prime factor, which in turn would imply that a(n) + a(n+1) is a multiple of the prime. But that would make finding a(n+2) impossible as any factor of a(n) would also be a factor of the sum.
%C A361606 To ensure the sequence is infinite a(n) must also contain a prime factor not in a(n-1). If this were not the case the sum a(n-1) + a(n) would be a multiple of the distinct prime factors of a(n), implying a(n+1) would not exist as any factor of a(n) would be a factor of the sum.
%C A361606 The last even term is a(114) = 210. As a(115) = 119 and a(116) = 255, the first occurrence of consecutive odd values, the resulting sum is even, so a(117) must be odd. This forces all subsequent terms to also be odd.
%C A361606 There is a concentration of terms at a(n) ~ 3.4*n. See the linked image. The only fixed point in the first 50000 terms is 14, although it is possible more exist.

%e A361606 a(8) = 18 = 2*3*3 as a(6) = 20 = 2*2*5 and a(7) = 45 = 3*3*5 and a(6) + a(7) = 20 + 45 = 65 = 5*13. As the sum contains 5 as a factor a(8) cannot, but it must contain both 2 and 3 while containing a factor not in 45 = 3*3*5. The smallest unused number satisfying these conditions is 18.
