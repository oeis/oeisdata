%N A361928 Triangle read by rows: T(n,d) = number of non-adaptive group tests required to identify exactly d defectives among n items.
%C A361928 Arguably, the triangle should be flanked by zeros on both sides -- for all n, T(n,0)=0 and T(n,n)=0 -- but these are not included here.
%C A361928 T(n,d) is the smallest number of rows that an n-column matrix can have while remaining d-separable.
%C A361928 Observations:
%C A361928 T(n,n-1) = n-1.
%C A361928 T(n,d) <= T(n+1,d).
%C A361928 T(n,d) <= T(n,d+1) whenever d <= n-2.
%C A361928 T(n,d) <= T(n+1,d) <= T(n,d)+1 whenever d < n.
%C A361928 T(n,d) < T(n+1,d+1) whenever d < n.
%C A361928 T(n+2,k+1) = n+1 whenever T(n,k)=n-1.
%C A361928 T(n, ceiling(n/2)) = n-1 for all n >= 1.
%C A361928 Elaqqad writes (see Links): "The only value of d for which T(n,d) is known completely is d=1, for which T(n,1)=ceiling(log n); the exact value even for d=2 is not known. Generally, the solutions to this problem are called 'testing designs', and the main considered ones are: (1) Set-packing designs or block designs; (2) Transversal designs; (3) Designs whose d-disjunct or d-separable matrices are directly constructed."

%e A361928 If we have 8 items, 3 of which are defective, we can identify the 3 defectives in 6 tests:
%e A361928        Test 1.  T..TT...
%e A361928        Test 2.  T....TT.
%e A361928        Test 3.  .T.T.T..
%e A361928        Test 4.  .T..T.T.
%e A361928        Test 5.  ..T.TT..
%e A361928        Test 6.  ..TT..T.
%e A361928 For example: If tests (1,2,3,4,5) are positive, then items (1,2,5) are the defectives. If tests (2,3,4,5,6) are positive, then items (6,7,8) are the defectives. If tests (2,4,5,6) are positive, then items (3,7,8) are the defectives.
