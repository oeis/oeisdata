%N A361684 Ramsey core number rc(n,n).
%C A361684 The Ramsey core number rc(s,t) is the smallest n such that for all edge 2-colorings of K_n, either the factor induced by the first color contains an s-core or the second factor contains a t-core.  (A k-core is a subgraph with minimum degree at least k.)

%F A361684 a(n) = rc(n,n) = ceiling(2*n - 3/2 + sqrt(2*(n-1)^2 + 9/4)).
%e A361684 For order 5, one of the two factors has at least 5 edges, and so contains a cycle.  For order 4, K_4 decomposes into two paths.  Thus rc(2,2)=5.
