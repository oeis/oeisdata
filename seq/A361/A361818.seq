%N A361818 For any number k >= 0, let T_k be the triangle whose base corresponds to the ternary expansion of k (without leading zeros) and other values, say t above u and v, satisfy t = (-u-v) mod 3; this sequence lists the numbers k such that T_k has 3-fold rotational symmetry.
%C A361818 We can devise a similar sequence for any fixed base b >= 2; the present sequence corresponds to b = 3, and A334556 corresponds to b = 2.
%C A361818 This sequence is infinite as it contains A048328.
%C A361818 If k belongs to the sequence, then A004488(k) and A030102(k) belong to the sequence.
%C A361818 Empirically, there are 2*3^floor((w-1)/3) positive terms with w ternary digits.
%C A361818 For any k, if t appears above u and v in T_k, then t + u + v = 0 (mod 3) and #{t, u, v} = 1 or 3 (the three values are either equal or all distinct); each value is uniquely determined by the two others in the same way: t = (-u-v) mod 3, u = (-t-v) mod 3, v = (-t-u) mod 3; this means that we can reconstruct T_k from any of its three sides.
%C A361818 If some row of T_k, say r, has w values and corresponds to the ternary expansion of m, then the row above r corresponds to the w-1 rightmost digits of the ternary expansion of A060587(m).
%C A361818 All positive terms belong to A297250 (their most significant digit equals their least significant digit in base 3).
