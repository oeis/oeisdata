%N A361400 a(n) is the product of n and the number displayed on the upper face of a six-sided die as a result of its rotation through the edge when rolling over the cell with the number n of the square spiral of the natural row.
%C A361400 A one-cell wide spiral is drawn along the grid lines of an infinite checkered plane, twisting clockwise (see the figure at the link). In the initial cell of the spiral is placed a die with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, in which the sum of points on opposite sides is 7, so that 1 is on its upper side, 4 is on its front and 5 is on the right. The size of the face of the cube coincides with the size of the cell of the plane. The cube, rolling over the edge, enters the next cell in a spiral, and so on, moving along the cells of the drawn spiral. The number in each cell of the spiral is multiplied by the number located on the upper face of the game cube rolling along it, and thus this sequence is obtained.
