%N A361561 Number of even middle divisors of n, where "middle divisor" means a divisor in the half-open interval [sqrt(n/2), sqrt(n*2)).
%C A361561 Number of even divisors of n in the half-open interval [sqrt(n/2), sqrt(n*2)).
%C A361561 Also number of even numbers in the n-th row of A299761.
%F A361561 a(n) = A067742(n) - A358434(n).
%e A361561 For n = 18 the middle divisor of 18 is [3]. There are no even middle divisors of 18 so a(18) = 0.
%e A361561 For n = 20 the middle divisors of 20 are [4, 5]. There is only one even middle divisor of 20 so a(20) = 1.
%e A361561 For n = 24 the middle divisors of 24 are [4, 6]. There are two even middle divisors of 24 so a(24) = 2.
