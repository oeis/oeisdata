%N A361634 Integers whose number of square divisors is coprime to the number of their nonsquare divisors.
%C A361634 Appears to be a supersequence of A210490, and so also of positive squares and squarefree numbers (A005117). The first term that belongs in here but not in A210490 is 48. The nonsquarefree terms that are not squares are of the form p^(4k)*a, where a is a squarefree number, p is prime, and k > 0. About half of perfect numbers are of this form; one example is 496 = 2^4*31. The sequence has an asymptotic density of about 0.6420.

%e A361634 48 has 3 square divisors (1, 4, and 16) and 7 nonsquare ones. Consequently, gcd(3,7)=1, thus 48 is a term.
