%N A361903 Numbers k for which sqrt(k/2) divides k and the symmetric representation of sigma(k) has a single part.
%C A361903 Every number in this sequence has the form 2^(2*i + 1) * k^(2*j), i,j>=0, k>=1.
%C A361903 The number of 1's in row a(n) of the triangle in A237048 as well as the length of that row are odd.
%F A361903 a(n) = k when A001105(n) = k and A237271(k) = 1.
%e A361903 a(4) = 32 has 4 as its single middle divisor, and its symmetric representation of sigma consists of one part of width 1.
%e A361903 a(9) = 288 = 2^5 * 3^2 has 3 middle divisors - 12 = 2^2 * 3 , 16 = 2^4, 18 = 2 * 3^2 - and its symmetric representation of sigma consists of one part, the section of maximum width 3 of the single part includes the diagonal (see also A250068).
