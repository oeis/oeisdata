%N A361382 The orders, with repetition, of subset-transitive permutation groups.
%C A361382 If G is a permutation group on k letters, k > 0, then G induces a permutation of the subsets of size j for 0 <= j <= k. We call G subset-transitive if it has only one orbit of subsets for each j. G is subset-transitive if and only if it is (at least) floor(k/2)-transitive.
%C A361382 This restrictive condition admits only 1) symmetric groups of degree k for k >= 1, with order k! = A000142(k), which are k-transitive; 2) alternating groups of degree k for k >= 3, with order k!/2 = A001710(k), which are (k-2)-transitive; or 3) two exceptional groups, of orders 20 and 120.
%C A361382 The group of order 20 is AGL(1,5), which is 2-transitive on 5 letters.
%C A361382 The exceptional group of order 120 is PGL(2,5), which is 3-transitive on 6 letters, and contains AGL(1,5) as its one-point stabilizer. It is isomorphic as an abstract group, but not as a permutation group, to the symmetric group of degree 5. An outer automorphism of the symmetric group of degree 6 interchanges the two types of subgroup of order 120.
