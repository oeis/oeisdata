%e A370125 The initial term 1 is included because A003415(1) = 0, every prime divides zero, including the smallest of primes, which is 2, and 2 is also the least prime that does not divide 1.
%e A370125 6 = 2*3 is included because the smallest prime that does not divide it is 5, and 5 is also the smallest prime dividing 6' = 5.
%e A370125 14 = 2*7 is included because the smallest prime dividing 14' = 2+7 = 9 is 3, which is also the smallest prime not dividing 14.
