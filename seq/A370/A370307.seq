%N A370307 Number of left-labeled (2,n)-bipartite graphs.
%C A370307 The bipartite graphs counted here arise as representations of certain types of calls in switching networks in which two callers can be in a call with an arbitrary number (n) of receivers, and where callers are distinguishable, but the receivers are not. In a more abstract setting, a left-labeled (2,n)-bipartite graph is a graph with two sets of non-overlapping vertices I and and O, where |I| = 2, |O| = n, and the two vertices in I are considered different (distinguishable), whereas the n vertices in O are considered interchangeable (indistinguishable). Our formula (sequence) gives the number of non-isomorphic graphs under these assumptions.

%F A370307 a(n) = (2*n^3 + 15*n^2 + 58 * n + 22.5 + 1.5*(-1)^n)/24.
%F A370307 a(n) = A002623(n) + n.
%e A370307 For n = 2, suppose that the left vertices are distinguishable and labeled a and b. The right vertices are indistinguishable but labeled d and e for notational convenience to describe the edges in the example bipartite graphs.
%e A370307 The nine left-labeled (2,2)-bipartite graphs are
%e A370307 (1) Empty bipartite graph (no edges)
%e A370307 (2) Place an edge between a and d
%e A370307 (3) Place an edge between b and d.
%e A370307 (4) Place an edge between a and d and an edge between a and e.
%e A370307 (5) Place an edge between b and d and an edge between b and e
%e A370307 (6) Place an edge between a and d and an edge between b and d
%e A370307 (7) Place an edge between a and d and an edge between b and e
%e A370307 (8) Place an edge between a and d and an edge between b and (d and e)
%e A370307 (9) Place an edge between a and (d and e) and an edge between b and (d and e).
%e A370307 The provided formula works out as:  (2*2^3 + 15*2^2 + 58 * 2 + 22.5 + 1.5*(-1)^2)/24 = (16 + 60 + 116 + 24 )/24 = 216/24 = 9.
