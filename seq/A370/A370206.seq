%N A370206 Numbers j whose symmetric representation of sigma(j) consists of two copies of unimodal width pattern 121 separated by 0.
%C A370206 Each term has 4 odd divisors and has the form 2^k * p * q, k > 0, p and q prime,  2 < p < 2^(k+1) <  2^(k+1) * p < q. The inequalities ensure that the four 1's in row a(n) of triangle in A237048 are in positions 1, p, 2^(k+1), and 2^(k+1) * p <= floor( (sqrt(8*a(n)+1) - 1)/2 ) < q and establish width pattern 1210 in SRS(a(n)) up to the diagonal. Also since p < 2^(k+1), numbers of the form 2^k * p^3 force p^2 < 2^(k+1) * p which creates a width pattern of the form 1212121.
%C A370206 When a(n) satisfies q = 2^(k+1) * p + 1 it is the smallest number with prime factor p  whose two parts of SRS(a(n)) meet at the diagonal since in this case 2^(k+1) * p = floor( (sqrt(8*a(n)+1) - 1)/2 ). The first 4 numbers with p = 3 are  2* 3 * 13 = 78, 2^4 * 3 * 97 = 4656, 2^5 * 3 * 193 = 18528 and 2^7 * 3 * 769 = 295296. The smallest number with prime factor p = 47 has 355 digits.
%C A370206 Conjecture: The subsequence of numbers m whose two parts of SRS(m) meet at the diagonal is infinite.
%e A370206 a(1) = 78 = 2 * 3 * 13 = A262259(3) and SRS(78) consists of 2 unimodal parts of width pattern 121 that meet at diagonal position (54, 54).
%e A370206 a(38) = 4 * 5 * 41 = 820 = A262259(6)  is the smallest number in the sequence divisible by 5 and the two parts of SRS(a(38)) meet at diagonal position (570, 570).
