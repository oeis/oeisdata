%N A391364 Numbers with more than one factorization (up to association) in Z[sqrt(-6)].
%C A391364 Note that Q(sqrt(-6)) has class number 2.
%C A391364 The complement of this sequence is the set of numbers m such that the non-principal prime ideal factors (counted with multiplicities) of (m) has a unique way to be grouped in pairs. In other words, m is not a term if and only if:
%C A391364  - either there is only one non-principal prime ideal dividing (m);
%C A391364  - or there are exactly two non-principal prime ideal factors of (m), each with exponent 1.
%C A391364 The same applies in every quadratic field whose class group has exponent 2.
%C A391364 Since (p) is the product of two distinct non-principal prime ideals if and only if p == 5, 11 (mod 24), this sequence consists exactly numbers divisible by 6, 2*p, 3*p or p*q (not necessarily distinct) for primes p, q == 5, 11 (mod 24).

%e A391364 The non-principal prime ideal factors of 10 are {P2,P2,P5,P5'}, which can be grouped in two ways {{P2,P2},{P5,P5'}} and {{P2,P5},{P2,P5'}}. Indeed, 10 = 2 * 5 = (2+sqrt(-6)) * (2-sqrt(-6)).
%e A391364 The non-principal prime ideal factors of 33 are {P3,P3,P11,P11'}, which can be grouped in two ways {{P3,P3},{P11,P11'}} and {{P3,P11},{P3,P11'}}. Indeed, 33 = 3 * 11 = (3+2*sqrt(-6)) * (3-2*sqrt(-6)).
%e A391364 The non-principal prime ideal factors of 55 are {P5,P5',P11,P11'}, which can be grouped in three ways {{P5,P5'},{P11,P11'}}, {{P5,P11},{P5',P11'}} and {{P5,P11'},{P5',P11}}. Indeed, 55 = 5 * 11 = (7-sqrt(-6)) * (7+sqrt(-6)) = (1-3*sqrt(-6)) * (1+3*sqrt(-6)).
