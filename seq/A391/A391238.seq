%N A391238 Number of irreducible polynomial factors of Stern polynomial B(n,x) that are not Stern polynomials, counted with multiplicity.
%H A391238 Antti Karttunen, <a href="/A391238/b391238.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..65537</a>
%F A391238 a(n) = A277013(n) - A391237(n).
%e A391238 Stern polynomial B(15,x) is x^3 + x^2 + x + 1, which factorizes as (x + 1)(x^2 + 1), where the latter factor is not a Stern polynomial, thus a(15) = 1.
%e A391238 Stern polynomial B(225,x) is x^6 + 2*x^5 + 3*x^4 + 4*x^3 + 3*x^2 + 2*x + 1, which factorizes to irreducible factors as (x + 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^2 + 1), where (x + 1) = B(3,x), but (x^2 + 1), is not a Stern polynomial, thus a(225) = 2, as (x^2 + 1) occurs with multiplicity 2.
%e A391238 Stern polynomial B(4095,x) is x^11 + x^10 + x^9 + x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1, which factorizes as (x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^2 + x + 1)(x^4 - x^2 + 1), of which factors only (x + 1) and (x^2 + x + 1) are Stern polynomials, therefore a(4095) = 5-2 = 3.
