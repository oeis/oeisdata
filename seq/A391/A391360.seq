%N A391360 Number of irreducible elements of Z[(1+sqrt(-15))/2] (the ring of integers of Q(sqrt(-15))) of norm n up to association.
%C A391360 Note that Q(sqrt(-15)) has class number 2.
%C A391360 Note that a is irreducible if and only if (a) is either a prime ideal of the product of two (not necessarily distinct) non-principal prime ideals; the same applies in every quadratic field whose class group has exponent 2. We have:
%C A391360  - {N(P) : P principal prime ideal} = {p : p prime == 1, 4 (mod 15)} U {p^2 : p prime == 7, 11, 13, 14 (mod 15)}. There are two prime ideals with norm p for each prime p == 1, 4 (mod 15), and only one with norm p^2;
%C A391360  - {N(P) : P non-principal prime ideal} = {3, 5} U {p : p prime == 2, 8 (mod 15)}. There are two prime ideals with norm p for each prime p == 2, 8 (mod 15), and only one with norm 3 or 5.
%C A391360 As a result:
%C A391360  - a(9) = a(15) = a(25) = a(p^2) = 1 for primes p == 7, 11, 13, 14 (mod 15);
%C A391360  - a(p) = 2 for primes p == 1, 4 (mod 15);
%C A391360  - a(3*p) = a(5*p) = 2 for primes p == 2, 8 (mod 15);
%C A391360  - a(p^2) = 3 for primes p == 2, 8 (mod 15);
%C A391360  - a(p*q) = 4 for distinct primes p == 2, 8 (mod 15);
%C A391360  - a(n) = 0 for every other n.
