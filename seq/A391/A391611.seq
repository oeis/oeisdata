%N A391611 The number of partitions of n into parts so that there exists exactly one part whose multiplicity is equal to its value.
%C A391611 This sequence was inspired by a puzzle, "IQ Tests," from the book Mathematical Puzzles and Curiosities.
%C A391611 Consider a multiple-choice question: "How many correct answer choices are there: (a) 1, (b) 1, (c) 2, (d) 2?" Answer 2 can be considered correct as it appears twice. This sequence counts the number of multiple-choice questions, where choices are natural numbers that sum to n and which have exactly one correct answer.
%C A391611 If we split Young diagrams into rectangles formed by rows of the same length, these are the diagrams with n cells that contain exactly one square.

%F A391611 G.f.: Sum_{k>0} (x^(k^2)) * Product_{i>0, i!=k} ( 1/(1-x^i) - x^(i^2) ).
%e A391611 Consider the 5 partitions of 4: (1,1,1,1), (2,1,1), (2,2), (3,1), and (4). Only the partitions (3,1) and (2,2) satisfy the requirement. In the first case, 1 appears once (with its own multiplicity), and in the second, 2 appears twice. Thus, a(4)=2.
%e A391611 Keep in mind that the partition (1,2,2) of 5 doesn't count towards a(5), as there are TWO different part values, 1 and 2, with correct multiplicities.
