%N A391203 a(n) is the number of 5 element sets of distinct integer-sided trapezoids whose base angles are 60 degrees that fill an equilateral triangular grid of side n units formed by directly binary space partitioning 3-trapezoid sets without forming 4-trapezoid sets.
%C A391203 Let P be a floating point inside of the triangle ABC such that PDBE,PECF, and PFAD are trapezoids whose base angles are 60 degrees. Where the points D,E,F lie on the sides AB,BC and CA respectively. Partitioning the trapezoid PECF into three distinct trapezoids is done under two mutually exclusive ways:
%C A391203 Category-C1: Select a point M on PF and a point N on CE such that MN is parallel to PE. Then select a point G on MP and a point H on NE such that GH is parallel to FC. Three trapezoids are PEHG, GHNM and MNCF.
%C A391203 Category-C2: Select a point M on PF and a point N on CE such that MN is parallel to PE. Then select a point G on PE and a point H on MN such that GH is parallel to AC. Three trapezoids are PGHM, GENH and MNCF.
%C A391203 A trapezoid whose base angles are 60 degrees with larger base b and legs s is denoted by {b X s} here.

%e A391203 n = 8 has three sets of trapezoids: category-C1 has 0 sets, category-C2 has 3 sets. Therefore a(8) = 3.
%e A391203 C2 sets are:
%e A391203  {{2 X 1}, {3 X 1}, {5 X 1}, {4 X 3}, {6 X 4}},
%e A391203  {{2 X 1}, {3 X 1}, {4 X 2}, {6 X 2}, {5 X 4}},
%e A391203  {{2 X 1}, {4 X 1}, {3 X 2}, {6 X 1}, {6 X 5}}.
%e A391203 n = 11 has 32 sets of trapezoids: category-C1 has 3 sets, category-C2 has 29 sets. Therefore a(11) = 32.
%e A391203 C1 sets are:
%e A391203  {{2 X 1}, {3 X 1}, {4 X 1}, {4 X 3}, {10 X 7}},
%e A391203  {{2 X 1}, {3 X 1}, {3 X 2}, {5 X 2}, {10 X 8}},
