%N A391089 Primitive exponential unitary Zumkeller numbers: powerful numbers whose exponential unitary divisors can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets of equal sum.
%C A391089 Any term of A391088 is of the form k*m where k is a term of this sequence and m is a squarefree number coprime to k. Therefore, A391088 can be generated from this sequence by multiplying terms with coprime squarefree numbers, and the asymptotic density of A391088 can be evaluated from the terms of this sequence (see the Comments section of A391088).
%C A391089 The least odd term is a(1458) = A321147(1) = 225450225 = (3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13)^2, which is the least odd exponential abundant number.
