%N A391072 Numbers of twin prime candidates in primorial interval of prime(n)# after elimination by prime factor prime(n-1).
%C A391072 The number of twin prime candidates remaining in the primorial(n)# interval after sieving with prime(n-1).
%C A391072 Conjecture: This number goes to infinity when n approaches infinity.
%C A391072 The interval in which to count twin prime candidates is to start at prime(n)+1 and to have the length of one primorial, that is to end at the number (n)# + prime(n).
%C A391072 The prime candidates occur in the process of identifying primes with the sieve of Eratosthenes. For each prime p used to identify composite numbers, a number of twin prime candidates are eliminated within the interval by one of its components being identified as composite. A twin prime candidate not eliminated when the process has advanced beyond the moment where its components are smaller than p^2 cannot be eliminated and is identified as a twin prime number.
%C A391072 The number of eliminations of twin prime candidates within the primorial interval that can be attributed to sieving with the prime(n) is given by A121406.
%C A391072 Conjecture: The number of twin prime candidates remaining in the primorial(n)# interval after sieving with the prime(n) is given by A059861.This number goes to infinity when (n) approaches infinity.
%C A391072 When a number of prime twin candidates given by this sequence is eliminated from a prime(n)# interval, by the eliminators given by A121406, the corresponding numbers of remaining candidates are given by A059861.
