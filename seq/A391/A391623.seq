%N A391623 Positive integers k such that there is more than one nonnegative sequence whose first sums are the k-th composition in standard order.
%C A391623 The first sums of a nonempty sequence (a, b, c, d, ...) are (a+b, b+c, c+d, ...).
%C A391623 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
%C A391623 Also numbers k such that there is a unique integer b such that the b-based partial alternating sums of the k-th composition in standard order are all nonnegative. Here, the b-based partial alternating sums of a finite sequence q are given by pas(q,b)_j = (-1)^j * b + Sum_{i=1..j} (-1)^(i+j) * q_i. This is a signed version of the partial sums transformation, inverse to the "first sums" transformation.
%F A391623 Complement of A390747 U A391622.
%e A391623 For n = 54, the composition (1,2,1,2) is the first sums of (0,1,1,0,2) only, so 54 is not in the sequence.
%e A391623 For n = 150, all sequences with first sums (3,2,1,2) are of the form (b,3-b,-1+b,2-b,b) for some b. This is nonnegative for b = 1 or b = 2, so 150 is in the sequence.
