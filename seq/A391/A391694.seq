%N A391694 Number of distinct automorphism group orders among unlabeled trees with n vertices.
%C A391694 Let T_n be the set of all unlabeled trees on n vertices. For each T in T_n, let Aut(T) denote its automorphism group. Then a(n) = | { |Aut(T)| : T in T_n } |.

%e A391694 For n = 5 there are three unlabeled trees. One tree has automorphism group of order 24, and two trees have automorphism groups of order 2. Hence the distinct orders are {2, 24}, and a(5) = 2.
