%N A391283 Primitive exponential admirable numbers: the powerful terms in A336680.
%C A391283 If k is a term, then k*m is a term in A336680 for any squarefree number m that is coprime to k.
%C A391283 Any term in A336680 is of the form k*m where k is a term in this sequence and m is a squarefree number coprime to k. Therefore, A336680 can be generated from this sequence by multiplying with coprime squarefree numbers, and the asymptotic density of A336680 can be evaluated from the terms in this sequence (see the Comments section of A336680).
%C A391283 The least odd term is a(2513) = A391284(1) = 6485886225.
%C A391283 If k is a unitary admirable number (A328328) that is squarefree, then k^2 is a term (and conversely, if k^2 is a term and k is squarefree, then k is in A328328). There are terms that are not squares of squarefree numbers, e.g., 4500, 12348, 47916, ... .
