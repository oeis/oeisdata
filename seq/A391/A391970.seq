%N A391970 Numbers m such that the product m*(m+1) has a set of prime divisors, from greatest down to 2, that is missing exactly two prime divisors.
%C A391970 The number of distinct prime divisors, omega(m*(m+1)) is exactly two less than the index of the greatest prime divisor, pi(gpf(m*(m+1))): A252489(m) - A059957(m) = 2.
%C A391970 Although 1109496723125 may be the last term in this sequence, if not, subsequent terms are greater than 2*10^14 by computational verification.
%C A391970 The sequence must terminate because the growth rate of A252489 exceeds A059957 enough to produce a continuing difference of more than two eventually, so thereafter the factorization of the product will have more than two gaps.

%e A391970 a(1) = 7 because 7*8 = 56 with gpf 7 and pi(7) = 4 while omega(56) = 2 because it has only 2 and 7 for prime divisors, missing prime divisors 3 and 5.
%e A391970 a(2) = 10 because 10*11 = 110 with gpf 11 and pi(11) = 5 while omega(110) = 3 because it has only 2, 5 and 11 for prime divisors, missing prime divisors 3 and 7.
%e A391970 a(3) = 11 because 11*12 = 132 with gpf 11 and pi(11) = 5 while omega(132) = 3 because it has only 2, 3, and 11 for prime divisors, missing prime divisors 5 and 7.
