%N A391475 Numbers k for which the symmetric representation of sigma, SRS(k), has at least 3 parts and the smallest positive difference between two parts is at most 10, or all parts have the same size.
%C A391475 For any k in this sequence for which SRS(k) is either { a, b, a } or { a, b, b, a }, abs(b-a) is the only possible positive difference when a != b. When SRS(k) has 5 or more parts several differences are possible.
%C A391475 This sequence includes the two known numbers 15 and 5950 in sequence A251820.
%C A391475 Two positive differences d_1 < d_2 <= 12 do not exist for SRS(k) with k <= 10^6.
%e A391475 Numbers belonging to the sequence:
%e A391475 A251820(1) = 15 since SRS(15) = { 8, 8, 8 }.
%e A391475 63 since SRS(63) = { 32, 16, 12, 16, 32 } has 4 as least positive difference of two parts.
%e A391475 837 since SRS(837) = { 419, 141, 51, 58, 51, 141, 419 } has 7 as least positive difference of two parts.
%e A391475 A251820(2) = 5950 since SRS(5950) = { 4464, 4464, 4464 }.
%e A391475 6325 since SRS(6325) = { 3163, 635, 293, 288, 85, 85, 288, 293, 635, 3163 } has 5 as least positive difference of two parts.
