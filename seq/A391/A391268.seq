%N A391268 Smallest numbers k such that 2^k-1 when written in ternary contains its least significant zero in position n.
%C A391268 Smallest indices of "Mersenne" numbers (A000225) where, when written in ternary, the position of the lowest digit is n.
%C A391268 1, 3, and 15 are not included because 1, 7, and 32767 (or 2^1-1, 2^3-1, and 2^15-1) do not contain a zero in ternary.
