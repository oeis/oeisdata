%N A391242 Numbers k such that Stern polynomial B(k,x) can be expressed as a product of two Stern polynomials B(i,x) and B(j,x), with i, j < k.
%C A391242 If k is present, then 2*k is also present. See A391243 for odd terms.

%F A391242 {k such that A391239(k) > 2}.
%e A391242 Stern polynomial B(6,x) is (x^2 + x), which factorizes as x(x+1), i.e., B(6,x) is a product of B(2,x) and B(3,x), therefore 6 is included in this sequence.
%e A391242 Stern polynomial B(9,x) is (x^2 + 2x + 1), which factorizes as (x+1)(x+1), i.e., B(9,x) = B(3,x)^2, therefore 9 is included in this sequence.
%e A391242 Stern polynomial B(45,x) is 2*x^3 + 5*x^2 + 4*x + 1, and factorizes as (x+1)(x+1)(2x+1) = B(3,x)^2 * B(5,x) = B(9,x)*B(5,x), therefore 45 is included in this sequence.
