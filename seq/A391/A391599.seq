%N A391599 Minimum size of an intersecting family of n-sets such that every set of size at most n-1 is disjoint from at least one member of the family.
%C A391599 a(n) is the smallest integer k such that there exists a family F of k sets, each of size n, with the properties: (1) any two sets in F have nonempty intersection, and (2) for every set S with |S| <= n-1, there exists some A in F with A intersect S = empty.
%C A391599 Conjectured by Erdős and Lovász to satisfy a(n) << n. Proved by Kahn who showed a(n) = O(n), and it has been speculated that a(n) = 3*n + O(1).
%C A391599 The lower bound (8/3)*n - O(1) <= a(n) was proved by Erdős and Lovász (1975) and has not been improved.

%F A391599 (8/3)*n - O(1) <= a(n) <= C*n for some constant C and all sufficiently large n.
%F A391599 Conjectured: a(n) = 3*n + O(1).
%e A391599 a(1) = 1: Any single 1-set {x} works trivially.
%e A391599 a(2) = 3: The family {{1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}} is intersecting and for any singleton {x}, one of the 2-sets avoids x. No smaller family works.
%e A391599 a(3) = 6: A minimal family is {{1,2,3}, {1,2,4}, {1,5,6}, {2,5,6}, {3,4,5}, {3,4,6}}.
%e A391599 a(4) = 9: The unique extremal example (Tripathi 2014) on 11 vertices is {{1,2,3,4}, {1,5,6,7}, {2,5,8,9}, {3,6,8,10}, {4,7,9,10}, {1,8,9,11}, {2,6,7,11}, {3,4,5,11}, {1,2,5,10}}.
%e A391599 a(5) = 13: Three non-isomorphic extremal examples on 17 vertices were found by Barát and Wanless (2021).
