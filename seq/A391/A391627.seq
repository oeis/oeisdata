%N A391627 Numbers k such that there is more than one composition whose first sums are the k-th composition in standard order.
%C A391627 The first sums of a nonempty sequence (a, b, c, d, ...) are (a+b, b+c, c+d, ...).
%C A391627 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
%C A391627 Also numbers k such that there is more than one integer b such that the b-based partial alternating sums of the k-th composition in standard order are all positive. Here, the b-based partial alternating sums of a finite sequence q are given by pas(q,b)_j = (-1)^j * b + Sum_{i=1..j} (-1)^(i+j) * q_i. This is a signed version of the partial sums transformation, inverse to the "first sums" transformation.
%e A391627 The 584-th composition in standard order is (3,3,4), which is the first sums of (1,2,1,3) and (2,1,2,2), so 584 is in the sequence.
