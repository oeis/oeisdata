%N A391592 Maximum size of a subset S of {1..n} such that all subset sums of {1/k : k in S} are distinct.
%C A391592 This sequence arises from Erdős Problem #321.
%C A391592 It is the maximum size of a subset S of {1..n} such that the sums of the reciprocals of the elements of any subset of S are all distinct.
%C A391592 Equivalently, there are no two disjoint subsets X, Y of S such that Sum_{x in X} 1/x = Sum_{y in Y} 1/y.
%C A391592 Terms 1..20 computed by epistemologist; terms 21..36 computed by Stijn Cambie; terms 37..54 computed by Cong Lu.
%C A391592 The sequence first diverges from A384927 at n = 21 (see Tao link).

%e A391592 For n=6, the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} has all distinct reciprocal sums, so a(6) >= 5.
%e A391592 If we attempt to include 6, we find that 1/2 = 1/3 + 1/6.
%e A391592 Thus, we must exclude an element from {2, 3, 6}, leading to a maximum size of 5.
