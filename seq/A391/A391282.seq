%N A391282 Primitive e-semiproper perfect numbers: powerful numbers k for which A323309(k) = 2*k.
%C A391282 1307484087615221689700651798824550400000 is also a term.
%C A391282 If k is a term and m is a squarefree number that is coprime to k, then k*m is an e-semiproper perfect number.
%C A391282 A number k is e-semiproper (or exponential semiproper) perfect number if its sum of e-semiproper divisors (A323309) is 2*k.
%C A391282 Any e-semiproper perfect number is of the form k*m where k is a term in this sequence and m is a squarefree number coprime to k. Therefore, the sequence of e-semiproper perfect numbers can be generated from this sequence by multiplying with coprime squarefree numbers.
%C A391282 All the known e-semiproper perfect numbers are also e-unitary perfect numbers, and all the known e-unitary perfect numbers are also e-perfect numbers (A054979). The sequence of e-perfect numbers that are not e-unitary perfect is A322858, and the sequence of e-unitary perfect numbers that are not e-semiproper perfect numbers is A323310. The first 41393 e-semiproper perfect numbers are also e-unitary perfect numbers, and the first 150 e-semiproper perfect numbers are also e-perfect numbers.
%C A391282 This sequence is the sorted sequence of the perfect unitary numbers (A002827) multiplied by their squarefree kernels (A007947).
%C A391282 The asymptotic density of the e-semiproper perfect numbers is Sum_{n>=1} f(a(n)) = 0.00867797..., where f(n) = (6/(Pi^2*n)) * Product_{prime p|n} (p/(p+1)).
%C A391282 If there are only 5 perfect unitary numbers, then this density is exactly 7453619195379627560444602846776888889/(87026031681195030667085343621120000000*Pi^2).
%C A391282 Comparing this density to the density of e-perfect numbers, i.e., A318645, we get that the density of the e-semiproper perfect numbers (assuming that they are all e-perfect) within the e-perfect numbers is 0.9981... . Similarly, assuming that they are all e-unitary perfect, their density within the e-unitary perfect numbers is 0.9999939... (see also A391281 for the density of e-unitary perfect numbers).
%C A391282 The 5 known terms are also primitive e-perfect numbers (A054980), and primitive e-unitary perfect numbers (A391281).
%C A391282 If there is a primitive e-unitary perfect that is not an e-unitary perfect number, then at least one of its prime factorization exponents must be composite. The 5 known terms have only the exponents: 2, 3, 7, or 19 (so they are all terms in A056166).
