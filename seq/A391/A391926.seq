%N A391926 Square array read by descending antidiagonals: find the k-th natural number i that satisfies i*n = A048720(i,m) for some m, then A(n, k) = m. Here A048720 is carryless base-2 multiplication.
%C A391926 Array A391925 gives the corresponding k-th natural number i.
%C A391926 It seems that the number of distinct values m that can appear on row n has A000120(n) as its upper bound, which is attained in most cases, but not always, especially if n is of the form 2^(2*e-1). For example, for n = 57 (111001 in binary), the m seem to be one of [57, 73, 89, 105], for n = 63, one of [63, 67, 71, 79, 83, 107], for n = 255, one of [255, 259, 263, 267, 287, 291, 359, 427], while for n = 31, only either one of [31, 35], and for n = 127, only one of [127, 131, 151, 155]? - _Antti Karttunen_, Dec 24 2025
