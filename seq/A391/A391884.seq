%N A391884 Numbers k such that k^2 - 1 is one of Ramanujan's largely composite numbers (A067128).
%C A391884 Is this a finite sequence?
%C A391884 Ramanujan's largely composite numbers (A067128) are numbers m, such that there is no number from 1 to m - 1 with more divisors than m.
%C A391884 Also numbers k such that (k - 1)*(k + 1) is a Ramanujan's largely composite number.
%C A391884 There is no number k such that 208 < k < 10000 such that A067128(k) + 1 is a square number.
%e A391884 13 is in this sequence because 13^2 - 1 = 168 which is a Ramanujan's largely composite number, which is because 168 has 16 divisors, and there is no number between 1 and 167 which has more than 16 divisors.
%e A391884 23 is not in this sequence because 23^2 - 1 = 528 which is not a Ramanujan's largely composite number, which is because 528 has 20 divisors, and between 1 and 527, the numbers 360, 420, 480 and 504 all have more than 20 divisors, and all of them have 24 divisors.
