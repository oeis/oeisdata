%N A391422 Discriminants of real quadratic fields with 1 class per genus.
%C A391422 Discriminants of real quadratic fields whose form class group is isomorphic to (C_2)^r, r >= 0.
%C A391422 Let p be a prime or the additive inverse of a prime. We know that p is represented by a binary quadratic form in the principal genus if and only if kronecker(d,p) >= 0, where d runs through the prime discriminants (fundamental discriminants divisible by only one prime) dividing d. Sequence gives D such that
%C A391422   kronecker(d,p) >= 0 for all d|D prime discriminants => p is represented by the principal form (i.e., there is an element of norm p).
%C A391422 Compare A391417, which gives D such that
%C A391422   kronecker(d,p) >= 0 for all d|D prime discriminants => p or -p is represented by the principal form (i.e., there is an element of norm +-p).
%C A391422 Let Cl+(D) and Cl(D) be the narrow class group and the class group of the quadratic order of discriminant D. Then Cl+(D)/Cl(D) = 1 if D < 0 or D > 0 and the fundamental unit has norm -1, C_2 if D > 0 and the fundamental unit has norm 1. Sequence gives D such that Cl+(D) = (C_2)^r for some r >= 0.
%C A391422 A391417 gives D such that Cl(D) = (C_2)^r. For D in A391417:
%C A391422  - If the fundamental unit has norm -1, then Cl+(D) = Cl(D), so D is in this sequence;
%C A391422  - If D has a prime factor congruent to 3 modulo 4, then Cl+(D) = Cl(D) X C_2, so D is in this sequence;
%C A391422  - In the remaining cases, Cl+(D) has a cyclic subgroup of order 4, so D is not in this sequence.

%e A391422 24 is a term: we have kronecker(-3,p) >= 0 and kronecker(-8,p) >= 0 <=> p = -2, 3, or p == 1, 19 (mod 24), and every such prime (positive or negative) is represented by the principal form x^2 - 6*y^2. For example, 1^2 - 6*1^2 = -5, 1^2 - 6*2^2 = -23.
%e A391422 136 is not a term since kronecker(8,-2) >= 0 and kronecker(17,-2) >= 0, but -2 is not represented by the principal form, since it is represented by the non-principal 34*x^2 - y^2. Note however that for every (positive or negative) prime p such that kronecker(8,p) >= 0 and kronecker(17,p) >= 0, one (and only one) of p or -p is represented by the principal form (i.e., 136 is in A391417).
%e A391422 145 is not a term since kronecker(5,5) >= 0 and kronecker(29,5) >= 0, but +-5 are not represented by the principal form. Indeed, they are represented by the non-principal form f(x,y) = 4*x^2 + 9*x*y - 4*y^2 (with f(3,-1) = 5 and f(1,3) = -5), so by Exercise 2.27(a), page 46 of D. A. Cox's book, they are not represented by the principal form.
