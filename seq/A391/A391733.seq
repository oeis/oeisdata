%N A391733 Numbers in whose binary expansion there is exactly one run of 1-bits with an odd length, while all other run of 1-bits are of an even length (or absent).
%C A391733 Numbers k such that A005940(1+k) is in A229125.
%C A391733 If n is a term, then 2*n is also a term, and vice versa.

%e A391733 4, in binary A007088(4) = 100, has one run of 1-bits, with length 1 (which is an odd number), therefore 4 is included in this sequence.
%e A391733 103, in binary 1100111, has one run of two 1-bits and one run of three 1-bits, therefore 103 is included as a term, as there is only one run with an odd length.
%e A391733 107, in binary 1101011, has two runs of two 1-bits and only one run of single 1-bit, thus only one run of 1's with an odd length, therefore 107 is included as a term.
