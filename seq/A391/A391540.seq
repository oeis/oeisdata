%N A391540 Products of all integers in prime gaps of size 4, or more, which are pi-complete (A055932).
%C A391540 This is a finite sequence having exactly 6 terms that are products, m*(m+1)*(m+2), where m-1 is one of the primes 7, 13, 19, 97, 349, 439.
%C A391540 Gaps between consecutive odd primes are even, so the number of composites within them is odd. Products of 5 or more consecutive integers cannot be pi-complete within a single prime gap: the Sylvester-Schur theorem guarantees a prime factor p > k (where k is the number of integers), forcing the inclusion of all primes <= p for pi-completeness. This requirement increases the necessary number of consecutive multipliers faster than prime gap sizes near m grow, making such configurations impossible or k >= 5. The only odd number between 1 and 5 is 3, hence all terms multiply exactly 3 consecutive composites.
%C A391540 This sequence is finite because the prime index of the greatest prime divisor of the product grows faster, after a point, than the number of distinct prime divisors of the product (those must be equal for the product to be pi-complete), and by reduction to Størmer's theorem (1897). For m*(m+1)*(m+2) to be pi-complete, all three integers must be p_k-smooth for some prime p_k. Consecutive p_k-smooth pairs (m, m+1) are finite and effectively computable; triple configurations (m, m+1, m+2 all smooth) are rarer still. Enumeration of all consecutive 17-smooth pairs finds the largest pair starts at m = 336140 (see A117581), well above the last term here at m = 440. Since A392566 shows pi(gpf) - omega > 0 for all m > 440, no further terms exist.
