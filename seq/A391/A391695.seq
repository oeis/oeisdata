%N A391695 Composite numbers k, not multiples of 10, whose (radix-10) constant congruence speed equals the minimum of the (radix-10) constant congruence speeds of all the prime factors of k.
%C A391695 The congruence speed of k is V(k) = A373387(k) and terms here are where V(k) = Min_{p prime factor of k} V(p).
%C A391695 V(k) >= V(p) for each prime factor p, as described in A391434, and terms here have V(k) at this minimum over its prime factors (two or more prime factors).
%e A391695 21 is a term since the constant congruence speed of 21 is V(21) = 1, and it equals the minimum of the constant congruence speeds of its prime factors (i.e., min{V(3),V(7)} = min{1,2} = 1 = V(3*7) = V(21)).
