%N A391538 Guaranteed win if opponent chooses one of three baskets and the player chooses the coins with values from 1 to n (see Comments for details).
%C A391538 At each of n turns your opponent chooses one of three baskets and then you choose one out of n coins which have the values from 1 to n. The coin chosen by you goes in the basket chosen by your opponent. After the last turn, you may choose which basket you take. a(n) is the guaranteed sum that you can achieve with the optimum strategy.

%F A391538 If n>4, a(n) = floor(n*(n-1)/6) + n (conjectured).
%e A391538 a(7) = 14. The optimum strategy is to distribute as evenly as possible the first n-1 coins between the three baskets. For 7 coins, the first 6 coins sum up to 21, which means you need to put a sum of 7 in all three baskets: coin 1 and 6 in one basket, coin 2 and 5 in another basket and coin 3 and 4 in the third basket. In the last turn you will place coin 7 in the basket your opponent is proposing and your total win is 14.
