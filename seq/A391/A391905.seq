%N A391905 Numbers which are the hypotenuse of a primitive Pythagorean quadruple whose legs are also members of a smaller primitive Pythagorean quadruple.
%C A391905 Primitive Pythagorean quadruples whose legs can yield smaller quadruples take the form (from smallest to largest) {even, even, odd, odd}, and cascades to yet smaller quadruples are not possible. Proof: quadruple terms cannot be all even or they would not be primitive, the sum of the squares of the legs mod 8 must equal the square of the hypotenuse mod 8 which forces the hypotenuse and exactly one leg to be odd, the odd leg must be the largest one because congruum triples must be all even or all odd (congrua A256418 are always even), and it has been proved that there are no congruum quadruples (Euler).
%C A391905 Most terms are observed to produce more than one quadruple pair, e.g. a(2) = 137 yields {12, 96, 97, 137} -> {7, 12, 96, 97} and {48, 84, 97, 137} -> {7, 48, 84, 97}. In most such cases, the smaller quadruples share the same hypotenuse and the same congruum-derived leg (97 and 7 in the example; 137^2 - 97^2 = 97^2 - 7^2 = 12^2 + 96^2 = 48^2 + 84^2 = congruum 9360). a(28) = 2737 is the smallest term that produces quadruple pairs with different congrua.

%e A391905 a(1) = 49 because {12, 24, 41, 49} is a primitive Pythagorean quadruple, and subset {12, 24, 41} is also a subset of primitive Pythagorean quadruple {12, 24, 31, 41}.
