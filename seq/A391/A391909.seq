%N A391909 Numbers k such that -1 <= A195017(k) <= 1.
%C A391909 These are the numbers such that if we count their odd-indexed prime factors and even-indexed prime factors separately (and count repeated factors) the 2 totals (see A257991 and A257992) differ by no more than 1. In other words, each multiset of prime factors is partitioned as evenly as possible by the parity of index of the primes.
%C A391909 Notably, we can view the terms as representing polynomials (encoded using prime factors as described in A206284). So considered, the set of terms represents a submonoid of N[x] under the operation A297845(.,.), which represents multiplication. Stern polynomials (see A260443) are a subset of the polynomials in this submonoid.
%C A391909 Precisely, the polynomials in the submonoid are those where the sums of the coefficients of odd, respectively even, powers of x differ by no more than 1. If we further restrict the sums to be equal, the submonoid we get is an ideal of N[x], the ideal generated by x+1. This ideal is represented likewise by A325698.
%C A391909 The sequence includes the products of any number of consecutive primes (A073485). A perfect power, m^k, k >= 2, is present if and only if m is in A325698.
%C A391909 Presumably, this sequence has zero asymptotic density.

%e A391909 10 = 2 * 5. 2 is the 1st prime and 5 is the 3rd prime, so 10 has a total of 2 odd-indexed prime factors but 0 even-indexed prime factors; these totals differ by more than 1, so 10 is not in the sequence. 10 represents the polynomial x^2 + 1.
%e A391909 90 = 2 * 3 * 3 * 5. 2 is the 1st prime, 3 is the 2nd prime and 5 is the 3rd prime, so 90 has a total of 2 odd-indexed prime factors and also 2 even-indexed prime factors (counting repetitions); these totals do not differ by more than 1, so 90 is in the sequence. 90 represents the polynomial x^2 + 2x + 1.
