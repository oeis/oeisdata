%N A391139 Primitive coreful Zumkeller numbers (second definition): coreful Zumkeller numbers (A339979) that are powerful numbers (A001694).
%C A391139 These are the primitive terms in A339979: Any term in A339979 is of the form k*m where k is a term in this sequence and m is a squarefree number coprime to k.
%C A391139 Therefore, A339979 can be generated from this sequence by multiplying terms with coprime squarefree numbers, and the asymptotic density of A339979 can be evaluated from the terms in this sequence (see the Comments section of A339979).
%C A391139 A number k is a term in A339979 if and only if k divided by its squarefree kernel is a Zumkeller number (A083207). Therefore, this is the sorted sequence of the Zumkeller numbers multiplied by their squarefree kernels (A007947). A number k is a term if and only if there is a Zumkeller number m such that A064549(m) = k.
