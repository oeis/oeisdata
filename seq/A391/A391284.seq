%N A391284 Primitive odd exponential admirable numbers: the powerful terms in A336681.
%C A391284 If k is a term, then k*m is a term in A336681 for any squarefree number m that is coprime to k.
%C A391284 Any term in A336681 is of the form k*m where k is a term in this sequence and m is a squarefree number coprime to k. Therefore, A336681 can be generated from this sequence by multiplying with coprime squarefree numbers, and the asymptotic density of A336681 can be evaluated from the terms in this sequence (see the Comments section of A336681).
%C A391284 If k is an odd unitary admirable number (A329188) that is squarefree, then k^2 is a term (and conversely, if k^2 is a term and k is squarefree, then k is in A329188).
%C A391284 Of the 43 terms in A329188 that are below 10^13, 39 are squarefree. Thus, this sequence has 39 terms up to 10^26 that are squares of squarefree numbers. The least term that is not the square of squarefree number is a(16) = 38296659062267731125 = (3 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 19 * 89 * 109)^2 * 5^3.
