%N A391638 Binary encoding of the disks missing from pin 1, after n moves, when moving infinitely many disks in the Tower of Hanoi starting from pin 1, via the optimal algorithm.
%C A391638 Disks are numbered 0,1,2,... with the smallest numbered 0.  Write a(n) in base 2; the powers 2^i appearing therein tells you what disks are on pin 2.  Initially infinitely many disks are on pin 0.  Move 1 moves a disk from pin 1 to pin 2, move 2 moves a disk from pin 1 to pin 3, move 3 moves a disk from pin 2 to pin 3.   Since a(3) = 3, disks 0 and 1 are missing from pin 1 after 3 moves.
%C A391638 The number k appears in this sequence if and only if it is in A295897.
%F A391638 a(n) = A392654(n) + A392655(n).
%e A391638 Move 1 moves a disk from pin 1 to pin 2, move 2 moves a disk from pin 1 to pin 3, move 3 moves a disk from pin 2 to pin 3.   Since a(3) = 3, disks 0 and 1 are missing from pin 1 after 3 moves.
