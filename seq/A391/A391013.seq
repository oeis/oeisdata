%N A391013 a(n) is the least k such that a k-gon is the first polygon where an agreement of the areas of k-gons inscribed and circumscribed to a unit circle agree with the true value of Pi when truncated to n digits.
%C A391013 The Archimedean approximation of Pi involved a unit circle with an inscribed and circumscribed n-gon. The value of Pi is bounded below and above by these two values. Archimedes famously stopped at a 96-gon with bounds of 3+10/71 and 3+1/7. However, the Archimedean approach used perimeters and polygons with 3*2^n sides.

%e A391013 a(1) must refer to the first polygon whose inscribed and circumscribed area are equal when truncated to the first digit, and also equal the first digit of Pi, 3. A 12-gon has inscribed area of 3 and circumscribed area of 3.21..., and is the first polygon which agrees on the digit 3.
