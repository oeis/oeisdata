%N A391504 Coreful-infinitary abundant numbers: numbers k for which A363331(k) > 2*k.
%C A391504 First differs from A377845 at n = 11. Differs from A377845 by having the terms 93312, 466560, 653184, ..., and not having the terms 3375, 4000, 6750, ... .
%C A391504 Numbers k such that the sum of the divisors of k that are both coreful and infinitary is larger than 2*k.
%C A391504 All the terms are both infinitary abundant numbers (A129656) and coreful abundant numbers (A308053) but this sequence is not the intersection of these two sequences, which includes the terms 72, 360, 504, 540, 600, 756, 792, 936, ... that are not in this sequence.
%C A391504 If k and m are coprime terms, then k*m is also a term.
%C A391504 In particular, if k is a term, and m is a squarefree number coprime to k, then k*m is also a term. The primitive terms in this sequence (A391505) are the powerful (A001694) terms.
%C A391504 The asymptotic density of this sequence is Sum_{n>=1} f(A391505(n)) = 0.00292533..., where f(n) = (6/(Pi^2*n)) * Product_{prime p|n} (p/(p+1)).
%C A391504 The least odd term is a(3384) = 1157625 = (3 * 5 * 7)^3.
%C A391504 The least term that is coprime to 6 is a(1.503...*10^20) = 51404758182902197698625 = (5 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19 * 23)^3.
