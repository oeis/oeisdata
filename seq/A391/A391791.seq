%N A391791 a(n)/2^(n-1) is the expected win if one of two baskets is chosen randomly and the player optimally chooses the coins with values from 1 to n (see Comments for details).
%C A391791 At each of n turns one of two baskets is randomly chosen and the player puts one out of n coins which have the values from 1 to n in that basket. After the last turn, the player may choose which basket they take. a(n)/2^(n-1) is the maximum expectation value a player can achieve with the optimal strategy.
%C A391791 Conjecture: For n>9 the optimal strategy is to put coin floor((n+3)/2) in the first basket.

%e A391791 a(3)=20. The player shall put coin 2 in the first basket. If the same basket is selected in turn 2, the player shall add coin 3 in this basket, giving an average of 5.5 points after the last turn. If the second basket is selected in turn 2 the player shall put coin 1 in this basket, giving an average of 4.5 points after the last turn. The average of 5.5 and 4.5 is 5 which is 20/2^2.
