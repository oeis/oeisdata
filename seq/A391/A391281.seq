%N A391281 Primitive e-unitary perfect numbers: powerful numbers k for which A322857(k) = 2*k.
%C A391281 1307484087615221689700651798824550400000 is also a term.
%C A391281 If k is a term and m is a squarefree number that is coprime to k, then k*m is an e-unitary perfect number.
%C A391281 A number k is e-unitary (or exponential unitary) perfect number if its sum of e-unitary divisors (A322857) is 2*k.
%C A391281 Any e-unitary perfect number is of the form k*m where k is a term in this sequence and m is a squarefree number coprime to k. Therefore, the sequence of e-unitary perfect numbers can be generated from this sequence by multiplying with coprime squarefree numbers.
%C A391281 All the known e-unitary perfect numbers are also e-perfect numbers (A054979). The sequence of e-perfect numbers that are not e-unitary perfect is A322858. The first 150 e-unitary perfect numbers are also e-perfect numbers.
%C A391281 The asymptotic density of the e-unitary perfect numbers is Sum_{n>=1} f(a(n)) = 0.008678..., where f(n) = (6/(Pi^2*n)) * Product_{prime p|n} (p/(p+1)).
%C A391281 Comparing this density to the density of e-perfect numbers, i.e., A318645, we get that the density of the e-unitary perfect numbers (assuming that they are all e-perfect) within the e-perfect numbers is 0.99814... .
%C A391281 The known terms are also primitive e-perfect numbers (A054980).
%C A391281 If there is a primitive e-unitary perfect that is not an e-perfect number, then at least one of its prime factorization exponents must be nonsquarefree. The known terms have only the exponents: 2, 3, 6, 7, or 19 (so they are all terms in A209061).
