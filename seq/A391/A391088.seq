%N A391088 Exponential unitary Zumkeller numbers: numbers whose exponential unitary divisors can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets of equal sum.
%C A391088 First differs from A335218 at n = 36: A335218(36) = 3600 is not a term of this sequence. Is this sequence a subsequence of A335218? There are no terms in this sequence below 10^16 that are not in A335218.
%C A391088 First differs from A318100 at n = 36, and from A127657 at n = 14.
%C A391088 Exponential unitary divisors (A361255) are defined in A322857.
%C A391088 Also called "e-unitary Zumkeller numbers" by Kalita and Saikia (2025).
%C A391088 The set of exponential unitary divisors of a number k is equal to the set of exponential unitary divisors of the powerful part of k (A057521), each multiplied by the powerfree part of k (A055231). Therefore, if k is a term and m is a squarefree number coprime to k, then k*m is also a term. The primitive terms of this sequence (A391089) are the powerful (A001694) terms. All the terms are of the form k*m where k is primitive and m is a squarefree number coprime to k.
%C A391088 The asymptotic density of this sequence is Sum_{n>=1} f(A391089(n)) = 0.0095751..., where f(n) = (6/(Pi^2*n)) * Product_{prime p|n} (p/(p+1)).
%C A391088 All the odd terms are exponential unitary abundant numbers (A383693), since there are no odd e-unitary perfect number (see A322858), as proved by Minculete and Tóth (2011).
%C A391088 The least odd term is a(2158694) = 225450225 = (3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13)^2, which is the least odd exponential unitary abundant number.
%C A391088 Are all the odd exponential unitary abundant numbers (A383693) terms in this sequence? If not, the least term in A383693 that is not a term in this sequence is larger than 10^18.
