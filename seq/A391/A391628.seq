%N A391628 Number of integer compositions of n that are the first sums of more than one composition.
%C A391628 The first sums of a nonempty sequence (a, b, c, d, ...) are (a+b, b+c, c+d, ...).
%C A391628 Also the number of compositions c of n such that there is more than one integer b such that the b-based partial alternating sums of c are all positive. Here, the b-based partial alternating sums of a finite sequence q are given by pas(q,b)_j = (-1)^j * b + Sum_{i=1..j} (-1)^(i+j) * q_i. This is a signed version of the partial sums transformation, inverse to the "first sums" transformation.
%C A391628 Are all these compositions free of 2?
%C A391628 From _Christian Sievers_, Jan 09 2026: (Start)
%C A391628 The terms in these compositions are all at least 3: for a different composition to have the same first sums as (a, b, c, d, e, ...) has, it has to be of the form (a+k, b-k, c+k, d-k, e+k, ...) for some nonzero integer k. For a first sum to be 2, it has to come from two adjacent 1 terms. But then the second composition giving the same first sums would have a term 1-|k| < 1, which is not allowed.
%C A391628 Equivalently, number of compositions of n that are the first sums of a composition with terms that are at least 2 at every other position. (End)

%e A391628 The composition (2,4,3) is not the first sums of any composition, so (2,4,3) is not counted under a(9).
%e A391628 The composition (3,4,3) is the first sums of (1,2,2,1) only, so (3,4,3) is not counted under a(10).
%e A391628 The composition (3,3,5) is the first sums of (1,2,1,4) and (2,1,2,3), so (3,3,5) is counted under a(11).
