%N A391774 Number of possibilities for the first n terms of the normalized chromatic difference sequence of the graph of a Young diagram.
%C A391774 The graph of a Young diagram has the cells of the diagram as its vertices, with two vertices being adjacent if (and only if) they lie in the same row or column. Given the chromatic difference sequence of a graph, subtract each term from the first term of the sequence. The resulting sequence is the normalized chromatic difference sequence.

%e A391774 It turns out that the first three terms of the chromatic difference sequence of the graph of a Young diagram could be k,k,k or k,k,k-1 or k,k,k-2 or k,k-1,k-1 or k,k-1,k-2 for some positive integer k. The corresponding normalized chromatic difference sequences are 0,0,0 and 0,0,1 and 0,0,2 and 0,1,1 and 0,1,2. There are five possibilities, so a(3) = 5.
