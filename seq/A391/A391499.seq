%N A391499 a(n) is the least possible difference between the areas of the largest and smallest trapezoids in a 5 element set of distinct integer-sided trapezoids whose base angles are 60 degrees that fill an equilateral triangular grid of side n units.
%C A391499 Let the difference between the largest and smallest areas of the trapezoids be called the defect. Then a(n) is the minimum defect. The area of a trapezoid {b X s} is s*(2*b-s).
%H A391499 Janaka Rodrigo, <a href="/A391499/a391499.txt">Python code for minimum defects of five trapezoid sets</a>
%e A391499 For n = 6, there are two sets of trapezoids:
%e A391499  {{2 X 1}, {3 X 1}, {3 X 2}, {5 X 1}, {6 X 1}} with defect = 11-3 = 8,
%e A391499  {{2 X 1}, {3 X 1}, {4 X 1}, {5 X 1}, {7 X 2}} with defect = 12-3 = 9.
%e A391499 Therefore a(6) = 8.
%Y A391499 Cf. A390522 (minimum defect of 3 element sets), A390523 (minimum defect of 4 element sets), A391498 (5-element sets).
