%N A391642 Number of integer compositions whose first sums are the n-th composition in standard order.
%C A391642 First differs from A333767 at n = 82.
%C A391642 The first sums of a nonempty sequence (a, b, c, d, ...) are (a+b, b+c, c+d, ...).
%C A391642 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
%C A391642 Also the number of positive partial alternating sums of the a(n)-th composition in standard order.
%e A391642 The 18-th composition in standard order is (3,2), and with these first sums we have only the composition (2,1,1), so a(18) = 1.
%e A391642 The 68-th composition in standard order is (4,3), and with these first sums we have compositions (2,2,1) and (3,1,2), so a(68) = 2.
%t A391642 stc[n_]:=Differences[Prepend[Join@@Position[Reverse[IntegerDigits[n,2]],1],0]]//Reverse;
%t A391642 pas[y_,k_]:=Table[(-1)^j*k+Sum[(-1)^(i-j)*y[[i]],{i,j}],{j,0,Length[y]}];
%t A391642 Table[Length[Select[Table[pas[stc[n],k],{k,0,Max[stc[n]]}],Min@@#>0&]],{n,100}]
%Y A391642 Positions of first appearances are A000079.
%Y A391642 For multisets see A390448.
%Y A391642 Positions of positive terms are A390676, union of A390568.
%Y A391642 Positions of 0 are A390677 (count A391680), nonnegative A390747 (count A391645).
%Y A391642 Positions of 1 are A390745 (count A391644), nonnegative A391622 (count A391643).
%Y A391642 For nonnegative instead of positive sequences we have A391621.
%Y A391642 A011782 counts compositions.
%Y A391642 A066099 lists all compositions in standard order.
%Y A391642 A357213 counts compositions by sum of first sums.
%Y A391642 A390432 lists first sums of standard compositions.
%Y A391642 A390673 ranks compositions with distinct first sums, counted by A390567.
%Y A391642 A390674 ranks compositions with equal first sums, counted by A342527.
