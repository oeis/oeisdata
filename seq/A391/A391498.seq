%N A391498 a(n) is the number of five element sets of distinct integer-sided trapezoids whose base angles are 60 degrees that fill an equilateral triangular grid of side n units.
%C A391498 This is the union of eight categories AA1, AA2, BB1, BB2, CC1, CC2, CC3 and DD1. Category DD1 describes how the triangle is filled by five distinct trapezoids by splitting each of the two trapezoids parallel to the larger base into two trapezoids of the three element sets.
%C A391498 A trapezoid whose base angles are 60 degrees with larger base b and legs s is denoted by {b X s} here.
