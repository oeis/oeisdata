%N A391845 Numbers k such that the least prime not dividing the arithmetic derivative of k is equal to the least prime dividing k.
%C A391845 After the two initial terms, this is a subsequence of A080364. The first terms that appear in A080364 but not here are: 55, 75, 77, 85, 91, 105, ...

%F A391845 {k such that A053669(A003415(k)) == A020639(k)}.
%e A391845 For 1, 1' = A003415(1) = 0, and there are no prime that would not divide 0, as there are no prime that would divide 1, therefore we include 1 in this sequence as a special case.
%e A391845 6 = 2*3 is included because the smallest prime that does not divide 6' = 2+3 = 5 is 2, which is also the smallest prime dividing 6.
%e A391845 15 = 3*5 is included because the smallest prime that does not divide 15' = 3+5 = 8 is 3, which is also the smallest prime dividing 15.
%e A391845 5005 = 5*7*11*13 is included because the smallest prime that does not divide 5005' = 2556 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 71 is 5, which is also the smallest prime dividing 5005.
