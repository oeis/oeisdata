%e A391792 a(3)=40. The player shall put coin 2 in the first basket. If the same basket is selected in turn 2 (probability is 1/3), the player shall add coin 3 in this basket, giving an average of 16/3 points after the last turn. If the second basket is selected in turn 2 the player shall put coin 1 in this basket, giving an average of 4 points after the last turn. The expected win is 16/3 * 1/3 + 4 * 2/3 which is 40/3^2.
