%N A391409 Discriminants of real quadratic fields F such that 16 is an 8th power in F_2, where F_2 is the completion of F with respect to a place above 2.
%C A391409 Let F be a number field. The Grunwald-Wang theorem states that:
%C A391409 - if t is a q-th power in every completion of F for an odd prime power q, then t is a q-th power in F;
%C A391409 - if t is a (2^n)-th power in every completion of F, then t is either a (2^n)-th power in F or 2^2^(n-1) times a (2^n)-th power (if n >= 3).
%C A391409 As a result, by the lemma below, F satisfies the local-global principle for n-th powers if and only if
%C A391409 - either at least one of -1, -2, and 2 is a square in F;
%C A391409 - or none of -1, -2, or 2 has a square root in F_v, where v is a place above 2.
%C A391409 In general there can be different places above p. But if F/Q is a Galois extension (for example if F is a quadratic extension), then the Galois group acts transitively on the prime ideals above p, and so all F_v are isomorphic.
%C A391409 Lemma. Let F be a field of characteristic != 2, and n >= 3. Then X^2^n - 2^2^(n-1) has a root in F if and only if at least one of -1, -2, and 2 is a square in F.
%C A391409 Proof. The "if" part is clear since (+-1+-i)^8 = (+-sqrt(-2))^8 = (+-sqrt(2))^8 = 16, so (1+i)^2^n = (sqrt(-2))^2^n = (sqrt(2))^2^n = 2^2^(n-1). Conversely, note that X^2^n - 2^2^(n-1) = (X^2+2*X+2)*(X^2-2*X+2)*(X^2+2)*(X^2-2)*Product_{k=3..n-1} (X^2^k + 2^2^(k-1)). If x is a root to X^2^k + 2^2^(k-1) = 0 (k >= 3), then x/(1 + x^2^(k-1)/2^2^(k-2)) is a root to X^2^k + 1 = 0, and so F0(zeta_{2^{k+1}}) is included in F, where F0 is the prime field of F. But F0(zeta_8) contains the square roots of -1, -2, and 2.
