%N A391363 Numbers with more than one factorization (up to association) in Z[(1+sqrt(-15))/2], the ring of integers of Q(sqrt(-15)).
%C A391363 Note that Q(sqrt(-15)) has class number 2.
%C A391363 The complement of this sequence is the set of numbers m such that the non-principal prime ideal factors (counted with multiplicities) of (m) has a unique way to be grouped in pairs. In other words, m is not a term if and only if:
%C A391363  - either there is only one non-principal prime ideal dividing (m);
%C A391363  - or there are exactly two non-principal prime ideal factors of (m), each with exponent 1.
%C A391363 The same applies in every quadratic field whose class group has exponent 2.
%C A391363 Since (p) is the product of two distinct non-principal prime ideals if and only if p == 2, 8 (mod 15), this sequence consists exactly numbers divisible by 15, 3*p, 5*p or p*q (not necessarily distinct) for primes p, q == 2, 8 (mod 15).

%e A391363 The non-principal prime ideal factors of 6 are {P2,P2',P3,P3}, which can be grouped in two ways {{P2,P2'},{P3,P3}} and {{P2,P3},{P2',P3}}. Indeed, 6 = 2 * 3 = ((3-sqrt(-15))/2) * ((3+sqrt(-15))/2).
%e A391363 The non-principal prime ideal factors of 85 are {P5,P5,P17,P17'}, which can be grouped in two ways {{P5,P5},{P17,P17'}} and {{P5,P17},{P5,P17'}}. Indeed, 85 = 5 * 17 = (5-2*sqrt(-15)) * (5+2*sqrt(-15)).
%e A391363 The non-principal prime ideal factors of 46 are {P2,P2',P23,P23'}, which can be grouped in three ways {{P2,P2'},{P23,P23'}}, {{P2,P23},{P2',P23'}} and {{P2,P23'},{P2',P23}}. Indeed, 46 = 2 * 23 = ((7+3*sqrt(-15))/2) * ((7-3*sqrt(-15))/2) = ((13+sqrt(-15))/2) * ((13-sqrt(-15))/2).
