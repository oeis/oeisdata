%N A391287 a(n) is the number of twin prime pairs entirely within the sets of length prime(n) that are incrementally taken from the sequence of odd consecutive primes.
%C A391287 Rarely, two consecutive sets can contain a lesser and a greater twin prime of the same twin prime pair so that it is split between them. First examples are [5, 7] and [7589, 7591]. These instances are discounted from the sequence.
%e A391287 a(1) = 1 because the 1st, prime(1) = 2-length set taken from the sequence of consecutive odd primes contains exactly 1 twin prime pair: [3, 5].
%e A391287 a(5) = 3 because the 5th, prime(5) = 11-length set taken from the sequence of consecutive odd primes contains exactly 3 twin prime pairs: [71, 73], [101, 103], and [107, 109].
%t A391287 seq[numprimes_] := Module[{p = Prime[Range[numprimes]], pp, ind, s}, pp = Prime[Range[2, Total[p] + 1]]; ind = Prepend[Accumulate[p], 0]; s = Table[pp[[ind[[k]] + 1 ;; ind[[k + 1]]]], {k, 1, Length[p]}]; Length[Select[Partition[#, 2, 1], #[[2]] - #[[1]] == 2 &]] & /@ s]; seq[70] (* _Amiram Eldar_, Dec 05 2025 *)
