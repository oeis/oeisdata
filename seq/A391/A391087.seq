%N A391087 Primitive exponential Zumkeller numbers: powerful numbers whose exponential divisors can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets of equal sum.
%C A391087 Any term of A335218 is of the form k*m where k is a term of this sequence and m is a squarefree number coprime to k. Therefore, A335218 can be generated from this sequence by multiplying terms with coprime squarefree numbers, and the asymptotic density of A335218 can be evaluated from the terms of this sequence (see the Comments section of A335218).
%C A391087 The least odd term is a(1715) = A321147(1) = 225450225 = (3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13)^2, which is the least odd exponential abundant number.
%H A391087 Amiram Eldar, <a href="/A391087/b391087.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..11902</a> (terms below 10^10)
%e A391087 36 = 2^2 * 3^2 is a term since it is a powerful number, and its exponential divisors, {6, 12, 18, 36}, can be partitioned into 2 disjoint sets whose sum is equal: 6 + 12 + 18 = 36. By multiplying 36 by any squarefree number that is coprime to 36 we get another exponential Zumkeller number. E.g., 36 * 5 = 180 is an exponential Zumkeller number since its exponential divisors, {6*5, 12*5, 18*5, 36*5} = {30, 60, 90, 180}, can be partitioned into 2 disjoint sets whose sum is equal: 30 + 60 + 90 = 180.
