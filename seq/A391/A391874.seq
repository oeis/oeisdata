%N A391874 Nonsquare integers >= 2 for which the square of its largest prime factor equals the sum of the squares of its other prime factors, with multiplicity.
%C A391874 Equivalent to: for k >= 3, products of all Pythagorean k-tuples comprised of only primes, with each term as such representing exactly 1 k-tuple.
%C A391874 Subsequence of A390574, which includes square terms.
%C A391874 240 is the only term with <= 6 total prime factors. Proof: squares of odd numbers are always 1 mod 8, and because the largest prime factor of nonsquare terms must be odd, factorizations of {2, 2, odd, odd} and {2, 2, 2, 2, odd, odd} are the only ones possible with <= 6 factors. Of these, the former is impossible because no two prime squares differ by 8, and for the latter, 3 and 5 are the only primes whose squares differ by 16, giving 2*2*2*2*3*5 = 240.
%C A391874 A similar proof provides that terms for which all of the prime factors are distinct must have >= 15 factors, and that odd terms for which all of the prime factors are distinct must have >= 18 factors. The smallest examples of these are 2221594309375210770 (greatest factor = A385967(10) = 103) and 11704510329137474729936055 (greatest factor = 151) respectively.
%C A391874 Terms are congruent to {0, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9} (mod 12). - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Jan 05 2026
