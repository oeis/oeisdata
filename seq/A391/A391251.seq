%N A391251 Numbers k such that the square of Stern polynomial B(k,x) is also a Stern polynomial.
%C A391251 For any k in this sequence, the square of B(k,x) is by necessity B(k^2,x). See A391260.
%C A391251 If k is present, then 2*k is also present and vice versa.
%C A391251 The odd terms 1, 3, 7, 15, 27, 31, 63, 127, 255, 511, 1023, 2047, 4095, 8191, ..., are conjectured to be given by binary palindromes (A006995) that are equal to A000225(n)^(2*e-1), for some n, e >= 1.

%e A391251 Stern polynomial B(7,x) (see A125184) is x^2 + x + 1, and its square is x^4 + 2*x^3 + 3*x^2 + 2*x + 1, which is B(49,x), therefore 7 is present in this sequence.
%e A391251 Stern polynomial B(27,x) is x^3 + 3*x^2 + 3*x + 1, and B(27,x)^2 = x^6 + 6*x^5 + 15*x^4 + 20*x^3 + 15*x^2 + 6*x + 1 = B(729,x), therefore 27 is present in this sequence.
