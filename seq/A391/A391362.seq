%N A391362 Number of irreducible elements of Z[sqrt(10)] of norm n up to association.
%C A391362 Note that Q(sqrt(10)) has class number 2.
%C A391362 Note that a is irreducible if and only if (a) is either a prime ideal of the product of two (not necessarily distinct) non-principal prime ideals; the same applies in every quadratic field whose class group has exponent 2. We have:
%C A391362  - {N(P) : P principal prime ideal} = {p : p prime == 1, 9, 31, 39 (mod 40)} U {p^2 : p prime == 7, 11, 17, 19, 21, 23, 29, 33 (mod 40)}. There are two prime ideals with norm p for each prime p == 1, 9, 31, 39 (mod 40), and only one with norm p^2;
%C A391362  - {N(P) : P non-principal prime ideal} = {2, 5} U {p : p prime == 3, 13, 27, 37 (mod 40)}. There are two prime ideals with norm p for each prime p == 3, 13, 27, 37 (mod 40), and only one with norm 2 or 5.
%C A391362 As a result:
%C A391362  - a(4) = a(10) = a(25) = a(p^2) = 1 for primes p == 7, 11, 17, 19, 21, 23, 29, 33 (mod 40);
%C A391362  - a(p) = 2 for primes p == 1, 9, 31, 39 (mod 40);
%C A391362  - a(2*p) = a(5*p) = 2 for primes p == 3, 13, 27, 37 (mod 40);
%C A391362  - a(p^2) = 3 for primes p == 3, 13, 27, 37 (mod 40);
%C A391362  - a(p*q) = 4 for distinct primes p == 3, 13, 27, 37 (mod 40);
%C A391362  - a(n) = 0 for every other n.
