%N A391474 Numbers k for which the symmetric representation of sigma, SRS(k), has at least 3 parts and all positive differences between two parts are at most 10, or all parts have the same size.
%C A391474 Sequence A251820 is a subsequence of this sequence.
%C A391474 For all numbers k in the sequence found so far SRS(k) has either 3 or 4 parts and thus only one single positive difference of two parts.
%C A391474 The next entry in this sequence is larger than 10^7.
%C A391474 For numbers k computed so far in this sequence only differences 0, 2, 6, 8, 9 and 10 occur in SRS(k) while differences 1, 3, 4, 5 and 7 appear to occur only together with differences larger than 10.
%e A391474 Numbers belonging to this sequence:
%e A391474 A251820(1) = 15 since SRS(15) = { 8, 8, 8 }.
%e A391474 21 since in SRS(21) = { 11, 5, 5, 11 } number 6 is the only positive difference of two parts.
%e A391474 770 since SRS(770) = { 579, 570, 579 } has 9 as the only positive difference.
%e A391474 A251820(2) = 5950 since SRS(5950) = { 4464, 4464, 4464 }.
%e A391474 Number 117 is not in this sequence. Though SRS(117) = { 59, 21, 22, 21, 59 } has 1 as its smallest positive difference, the other positive differences exceed 10.
