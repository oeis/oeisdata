%N A391204 a(n) is the number of 5 element sets of distinct integer-sided trapezoids whose base angles are 60 degrees that fill an equilateral triangular grid of side n units with a trapezoid filled by 3 trapezoids.
%C A391204 Let P be a floating point inside of the triangle ABC such that PDBE,PECF, and PFAD are trapezoids whose base angles are 60 degrees. Where the points D,E,F lie on the sides AB,BC and CA respectively. Partitioning the trapezoid PECF into three distinct trapezoids is done under three mutually exclusive ways:
%C A391204 Category-C1: Select a point M on PF and a point N on CE such that MN is parallel to PE. Then select a point G on MP and a point H on NE such that GH is parallel to FC. Three trapezoids are PEHG, GHNM and MNCF.
%C A391204 Category-C2: Select a point M on PF and a point N on CE such that MN is parallel to PE. Then select a point G on PE and a point H on MN such that GH is parallel to AC. Three trapezoids are PGHM, GENH and MNCF.
%C A391204 Category-C3: Select a point G on PE and a point H on FC such that GH is parallel to CE. Then select a point M on GE and a point N on HC such that MN is parallel to CE. Three trapezoids are PGHF, GMNH and MECN.
%C A391204 A trapezoid whose base angles are 60 degrees with larger base b and legs s is denoted by {b X s} here.

%e A391204 n = 7 has 6 sets of trapezoids:
%e A391204 C1 has 0 sets.
%e A391204 C2 has 1 set,
%e A391204  {{2 X 1}, {3 X 1}, {3 X 2}, {5 X 1}, {5 X 4}}.
%e A391204 C3 has 5 sets,
%e A391204  {{2 X 1}, {4 X 1}, {3 X 2}, {6 X 1}, {6 X 2}},
%e A391204  {{2 X 1}, {3 X 1}, {5 X 1}, {4 X 2}, {6 X 2}},
%e A391204  {{3 X 1}, {4 X 1}, {5 X 1}, {4 X 2}, {5 X 2}},
%e A391204  {{3 X 1}, {4 X 1}, {5 X 1}, {3 X 2}, {6 X 2}},
%e A391204  {{3 X 1}, {5 X 1}, {6 X 1}, {3 X 2}, {5 X 2}}.
%e A391204 Therefore a(7) = 6.
