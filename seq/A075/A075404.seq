%N A075404 Smallest m > n such that Sum_{i=n..m} i^2 is a square, or 0 if no such m exists.
%C A075404 For a(1) see A000330.
%C A075404 The corresponding squares are in A075405, the numbers of terms in the sum = a(n)-n+1 are in A075406.
%C A075404 All terms were verified by solving elliptic curves. If a(n)>0, then there may be additional values of m that produce squares. See A184763 for more information.
%D A075404 See A180442.
%e A075404 a(1) = 24 because 1^2+...+24^2 = 70^2, a(7) = 29 because 7^2+...+29^2 = 92^2.
