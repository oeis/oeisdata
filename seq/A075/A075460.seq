%N A075460 Odd primitive numbers such that n! divided by product of factorials of all proper divisors of n is not an integer.
%C A075460 If a number is in the sequence, then all of its multiples would also meet the criterion, but are not included. This is meant by the word "primitive" in the definition.
%e A075460 1575 = 3^2*5^2*7 is in the sequence, because the product of the factorials of its proper divisors { 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 15, 21, 25, 35, 45, 63, 75, 105, 175, 225, 315, 525 } does not divide 1575!. (For example, the former's 2-adic valuation equals 1588 while the latter's 2-adic valuation equals only 1569.) This is the smallest odd number with this property. - _M. F. Hasler_, Dec 30 2016

%Y A075460 Cf. A075071. The first primitive n's with this property (most of which are even) are in A075422.
