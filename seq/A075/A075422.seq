%N A075422 Primitive numbers n such that the product of factorials of all proper divisors of n does not divide n!.
%C A075422 If a number is in the sequence, all of its multiples also meet the criterion, but are not included. This is what the word "primitive" refers to.
%F A075422 a(n) appears to be asymptotic to c*n with 12 < c < 15. - _Benoit Cloitre_, Sep 16 2002
%e A075422 The product of the factorials of the proper divisors of 24, 1! * 2! * 3! * 4! * 6! * 8! * 12!, is divisible by 2^26 and therefore does not divide 24! (which is divisible by 2^22 only). 24 is the smallest number with this property. - _M. F. Hasler_, Dec 31 2016
