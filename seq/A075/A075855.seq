%N A075855 Maximum number of black squares on an n X n chessboard (with a black square in at least one corner) that can be covered by a single path, traveling only to adjacent black squares.
%F A075855 For n odd, a(n)=(n-1)^2/2+1. For n even, it is conjectured that a(n)=(n^2-n+2)/2 (it is easy to show this is a lower bound).
%F A075855 Empirical g.f.: x*(1+x-x^2+2*x^3+x^4)/((1-x)^3*(1+x)^2). - _Colin Barker_, Apr 12 2012
