%N A075549 Decimal expansion of 9 - 12*log(2).
%C A075549 Choose two numbers at random from the interval [0,1] (using a uniform distribution). This will give three subintervals of lengths a, b and c. What is the probability that there is a triangle with sides a, b and c? Given that a such a triangle exists, what is the probability that it is obtuse? Answer: Probability that there is a triangle is 1/4. Probability for this triangle to be obtuse is = 9 - 12 * log(2) = 0.68223... .
%C A075549 The problem proposed by Singmaster (1973) is to the calculate the probability that the three segments can form an obtuse triangle. Its solution is 1/4 of this constant, i.e., 9/4 - 3*log(2) = 0.170558... . - _Amiram Eldar_, May 20 2023
