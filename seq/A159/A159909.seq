%N A159909 Number of pairs (p,q) of odd primes p < q < r=prime(n) such that the cyclotomic polynomial Phi(p*q*r) has no coefficient > 1 in absolute value.
%C A159909 The cyclotomic polynomial Phi[pqr] can only have coefficients with absolute value > 1 if p,q,r are distinct odd primes, that's why we require 2 < p < q < r. If any of these inequalities is replaced by equality, then Phi[pqr] necessarily has only zero or unit (+-1) coefficients. Sequence A159908 counts all possibilities including these trivial cases.

%e A159909 a(5)=1 is the first nonzero term, since the smallest example for Phi(pqr) having no coefficient > 1 (in abs. value) for odd primes p<q<r is obtained for r=prime(5), namely Phi(3*7*11).
