%N A159639 Last divisors at which integral quotients occur consecutively.
%C A159639 Considering dividend/divisor=quotient, in a(1) of A116536, A159578, and A159579, 3=30/10; sometimes integral quotients appear n times in succession -- see A159580 where a(3)indicates that 5 integral quotients appear one after another. A159581 and A159639 give the first and last values of the divisors producing these integral quotients.
%C A159639 Many of the associated sequences submitted by this author were wrong. Should be recomputed. The UBASIC program should be regarded with suspicion. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Oct 02 2011.
%e A159639 a(1)=154 because it is the last or second of two divisors (125 being the first) where integral quotients are produced in succession (one after the other): 5577321750/125=44618574, integral; and 161742330750/154=1050274875, integral. See a(4) in A116536, A159578, and A159579.
