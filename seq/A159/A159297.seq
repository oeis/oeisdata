%N A159297 Number of 3D matrices with positive integer entries such that sum of all entries equals n.
%C A159297 Equivalently, number of quadruples (i, j, k; P) such that i, j and k are positive integers and P is a composition of n into ijk parts. (A composition of n with m parts is an ordered list of m positive integers that sum to n. The number of compositions of n into m parts is given by the binomial coefficient C(n - 1, m - 1).) [_Joel B. Lewis_, May 07 2009]
%F A159297 a(n) = sum(C(n - 1, ijk - 1)) where the sum is over all triples (i, j, k) such that 0 < i, j, k and ijk <= n. [_Joel B. Lewis_, May 07 2009]
%e A159297 For n=3, the 10 possible matrices are: 3 (1*1*1); (1,2) as three different vectors (1*1*2, 1*2*1, 2*1*1); (2,1) as three different vectors (1*1*2, 1*2*1, 2*1*1); and (1,1,1) as three different vectors (1*1*3, 1*3*1, 3*1*1). [Typo corrected by _Joel B. Lewis_, Apr 04 2011]
