%N A159273 Smallest integer m, in absolute value, such that |m(prime(n)+m)| has as prime factors exactly all primes < sqrt(prime(n)); zero if no such m exists.
%C A159273 For prime(2)=3 no such integer exists, since there are no primes less than sqrt(3), but |m(3-m)|>1 for all nonzero m.
%C A159273 For all other primes up to prime(78)=397, a(n) is quickly calculated using the given code, with a(64)=19800 and a(68)=1724463 being the two largest values.
%C A159273 Since m and prime(n)-m cannot have a common prime factor, their respective prime factors form a partition of the primes <= sqrt(prime(n)). See A159273 for further details.

%F A159273 a(n) = A159273(A000040(n)).
%e A159273 a(1)=-1 since |-1*(2-1)|=1 has no prime factors, i.e. exactly the primes less than sqrt(2): There are none.
%e A159273 a(2)=0 since there is no (nonzero) integer m such that |m*(3+m)| has as prime factors exactly the primes less than sqrt(3), i.e. none.
%e A159273 a(3)=-1 since prime(3)=5=1+2^2, thus |-1*(5-1)|=2^2 has {2}={primes < sqrt(5)} as prime factors.
%e A159273 a(4)=1 since prime(4)=7=2^3-1, thus |1*(7+1)|=2^3 has {2}={primes < sqrt(7)} as prime factors.
%e A159273 a(77) = 2926 since prime(77) = 389 = 3315 - 2926 = 3*5*13*17 - 2*7*11*19, thus |2926*(389+2926)| = product of all primes < sqrt(389).
