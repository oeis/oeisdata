%N A159802 Number of primes q with (2m)^2+1 <= q < (2m+1)^2-2m.
%C A159802 1) Immediate connection to unsolved problem, is there always a prime between n^2 and (n+1)^2 ("full" interval of two consecutive squares).
%C A159802 2) See sequence A145354 and A157884 for more details to this new improved conjecture.
%C A159802 3) First ("left") half interval, primes q with (2m)^2+1 <= q < (2m+1)^2-2m.
%C A159802 4) It is conjectured that a(m) >= 1.
%C A159802 5) No a(m) with m>1 is known, where a(m)=1.
%C A159802 This is a bisection of A089610 and hence related to a conjecture of Oppermann. - _T. D. Noe_, Apr 22 2009
