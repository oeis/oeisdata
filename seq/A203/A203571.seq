%N A203571 Period length 10: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 4, 3, 2, 1] repeated.
%C A203571 This sequence can be continued periodically for negative values of n.
%C A203571 This is the fifth sequence of a k-family of sequences P_k, k>=1, which starts with A000007(n+1), n >= 0 (the 0-sequence), A000035, A193680, A193682, for k = 1, ..., 4, respectively.
%C A203571 In general, the sequence P_k, k >= 1 (periodically continued for negative values of n), is used to define the k equivalence classes [0], [1], ..., [k-1], with [j] := {n integer| P_k(n) = j}. Two integers are equivalent if and only if they are mapped by P_k to the same value. For P_5, P_6 and P_7 see the arrays (not the triangles) A090298, A092260 and A113807, respectively. In each of these cases the class [k] should be replaced by the class [0], and also negative n-values are allowed. Multiplication can be done class-wise. E.g., k = 5: P_5(n) = a(n), 7*12 == 3*2 = 6 == 4; a(7*12) = a(a(7)*a(12)) = a(3*2) = 4. This kind of multiplication could be called multiplication Modd n, in order to distinguish it from multiplication mod n. Addition cannot be done class-wise. E.g., k = 5: 7 + 12 = 19 == 1 is not equivalent to 3 + 2 = 5 == 0; a(7+12) = 1 is not equal to a(a(7) + a(12)) = a(3+2) = 0.
%C A203571 Periodic sequences of this type can be also calculated by a(n) = c + floor(q/(p^m-1)*p^n) mod p, where c is a constant, q is the number representing the periodic digit pattern and m is the period length. c, p and q can be calculated as follows: Let D be the array representing the number pattern to be repeated, m = size of D, max = maximum value of elements in D, min = minimum value of elements in D. Then c := min, p := max - min + 1 and q := p^m * Sum_{i=0..(m-1)} (D(i) - min)/p^i. Example: D = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 4, 3, 2, 1), c = 0, m = 10, p = 5 and q = 3034180 for this sequence. - _Hieronymus Fischer_, Jan 04 2013 [Corrected by _Rémi Guillaume_, Aug 28 2024]
%C A203571 For periodic sequences with terms < 10 one can use the well-known fact that ab..z/99..9 = 0.ab..zab..zab..z... (infinite periodic decimal fraction), this leads to one of the given formulas. For the general case it is sufficient to shift the terms to nonnegative values and to switch to a sufficiently large basis instead of 10 (there are infinitely many choices). - _M. F.

%F A203571 a(n) = n mod 5 if (-1)^floor(n/5) = +1 else -n mod 5, n >= 0. (-1)^floor(n/5) is the sign corresponding to the parity of the quotient floor(n/5). This quotient is sometimes denoted by n\5.
