%N A379424 Least modulus k such that the multiplicative group modulo k has a difference of n nontrivial cycles between its minimal and maximal representation.
%C A379424 This is equal to the least modulus k such that (Z/kZ)* has a representation as a direct product of cyclic groups, of which n are odd cycles. The number of even cycles in the maximal representation is equal to the total cycles in the minimal representation.

%e A379424 a(4) = 1333 because (Z/1333Z) = C210 x C6 = C2 x C3 x C5 x C2 x C3 x C7. The first representation has 2 cycles and the second has 6, a difference of 4.
