%N A297077 Number of distinct row and column sums for n X n (0, 1)-matrices.
%C A297077 a(n) is bounded above by 2^(n^2) and bounded below by A048163(n + 1).
%C A297077 Also the number of acyclic edge sets of the complete bipartite graph K_{n,n}. See proof by David E. Speyer at the Mathematics Stack Exchange link below.
%C A297077 It is also the number of n X n binary matrices that can be completed to the all-ones matrix by repeatedly changing an element from a zero to a one if that element is the only zero in its row or column. (Proof idea: Every acyclic edge set can be reduced to the empty set by removing one leaf edge at a time.) This can be interpreted as the number of ways of turning off storage nodes in an n X n array so that data remains restorable in the "full scheme" RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks) design described by Nagel, Süß.- _Jair Taylor_, Jul 29 2019

%e A297077 For n = 3, both of the following 3 X 3 (0,1)-matrices have identical row and column sums:
%e A297077 [1 0 1]     [1 1 0]
%e A297077 [0 1 0] and [0 1 0]
%e A297077 [0 1 0]     [0 0 1]
%e A297077 have row sums of [2 1 1] and column sums of [1 2 1].
%e A297077 So ([2 1 1], [1 2 1]) is one of the 328 possible row/column sums for a 3 X 3 matrix.

%Y A297077 Main diagonal of A328887.
%Y A297077 Cf. A048163 gives the number of row/column sums that uniquely identify a matrix.
