%N A297994 Primes such that the decimal digits in the first half of the number are a nontrivial permutation of the digits in the second half.
%C A297994 If the first half of a prime's digits repeat in the second half (thus the number of digits d is even), by being prime they cannot repeat in any visually eye-catching, aesthetically pleasing order, which is frustrating.  A d-digit number with an ordered repetition of digits abc...abc... is not prime because it is divisible by 10^(d/2)+1, while a d-digit number with a palindromic arrangement of digits is not prime because it is divisible by 11.
%C A297994 Such primes exist for d >= 6, of which at least two digits are distinct, and arranged such that the first half repeat, in a  disorderly way, in the second half.
%C A297994 For d=6, 265 of the 68906 primes belong here: 10 occur in form aababa, 7 occur in the form abaaab, 10 occur in the form ababaa, 9 occur in the form abbbab, 66 occur in the form abcacb, 58 occur in the form abcbac, 68 occur in the form abcbca, and 37 occur in the form abccab.
%C A297994 To find terms for which the first part of the digits is k > 99, where k has qk digits, compute fp = k * 10^qk. Then permute the digits of k. Compute fp + [this permutation]. If it is prime, it is in the sequence. Terms will have 2 * qk digits. See example. - _David A. Corneth_, Jan 11 2018

%e A297994 From _David A. Corneth_, Jan 11 2018: (Start) To see which 6-digit numbers are in the sequence and start with 127, we see that 127 has 3 digits, so we compute 127 * 10^3 = 127000. We then permute the digits of 127 to get {127, 172, 217, 271, 712, 721}. We discard the first one since we know it won't give a prime. For the other five, we compute 127000 + [that permutation].
%e A297994 We see that 127217 and 127271 are prime and hence are in the sequence. (End)
