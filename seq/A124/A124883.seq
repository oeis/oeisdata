%F A124883 T(n,1) = 1 for all natural numbers n. For n>1 and 1<k<n we have T(n,k) = min{j such that j<>T(n,i) for i<k and j<>T(r,s) for r<n and for all i<j we have T(i,j) + T(i,j-1) is in A001358}.
%e A124883 The n-th row is of length n. Each value is the smallest previously unused natural number such that the sum of every pair of adjacent values in the triangle is a semiprime (A001358).
%e A124883 Consider row 2. Starting with T(1,2) = 1, the least integer we can add to 1 and get a semiprime is 3, since 1 + 3 = 4 = 2^2 is semiprime. Consider row 3. Starting with T(1,3) = 1, the least integer we can add to 1 and get a semiprime is 1, but we've already used that. The next is 3, but we've used that. The least unused integer that works is 5, since 1 + 5 = 6 = 2 * 3 is semiprime. If we cross out ones from the triangle read by rows, what remains is a permutation of the natural number greater than 1. That is, every nonnegative integer appears in the triangle. The second column T(n,2) is monotone increasing.
