%C A124728 Subset of A045940 Numbers m such that factorizations of m through m+3 have same number of primes (including multiplicities). Cf. A124057, A124729 Numbers k such that k, k+1, k+2 and k+3 are products of exactly 3,5 primes. There are no numbers k such that k, k+1, k+2 and k+3 are products of exactly 6 primes(?)
