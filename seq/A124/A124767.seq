%N A124767 Number of level runs for compositions in standard order.
%C A124767 The standard order of compositions is given by A066099.
%C A124767 For n > 0, a(n) is one more than the number of adjacent unequal terms in the n-th composition in standard order. Also the number of runs in the same composition. - _Gus Wiseman_, Apr 08 2020
