%N A124168 Union of all n-Fibonacci sequences, that is, all sequences s(0) = s(1) = ... = s(n-2) = 0, s(n-1) = 1 and for k >= n, s(k) = s(k-1) + ... + s(k-n).
%C A124168 Note that an n-Fibonacci sequence contains the numbers 2^k numbers for k<n. We also get 2^n-1, 2^(n+1)-3, 2^(n+2)-8, ... The sequence -1, -3, -8, continues following A001792 (for n large)...
%C A124168 Noe and Post conjectured that the only positive terms that are common to any two distinct n-step Fibonacci sequences are the powers of 2 that begin each sequence and 13 (in 2- and 3-step) and 504 (in 3- and 7-step). Perhaps we should also include 8 (in 2- and 4-step). - _T. D. Noe_, Dec 05 2006
