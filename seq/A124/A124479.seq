%N A124479 From the game of Quod: number of "squares" on an n X n array of points with the four corner points deleted.
%C A124479 We count all squares whose vertices are among the points; the sides of the squares need not be horizontal or vertical.

%H A124479 <a href="/index/Rec#order_05">Index entries for linear recurrences with constant coefficients</a>, signature (5,-10,10,-5,1).
%F A124479 a(n) = (n^4 - n^2 - 48*n + 84)/12.
%F A124479 G.f.: x^3*(1+6*x-8*x^2+3*x^3)/(1-x)^5. - _Colin Barker_, May 21 2012
%F A124479 E.g.f.: exp(x)*(84 - 48*x + 6*x^2 + 6*x^3 + x^4)/12 - 7 - 3*x. - _Stefano Spezia_, Sep 02 2025
%e A124479 So for n=3 we have 5 points:
%e A124479      O
%e A124479     OOO
%e A124479      O
%e A124479 The only square is formed by the 4 outer points, agreeing with a(3)=1.
%e A124479 For n=4 we have 12 points:
%e A124479      OO
%e A124479     OOOO
%e A124479     OOOO
%e A124479      OO
%e A124479 There are 5 unit squares, 4 tilted ones with sides sqrt(2) and 2 tilted ones with sides sqrt(5), agreeing with a(4)=11.
