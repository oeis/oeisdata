%N A124796 Coefficients in expansion of powers of the operator "multiplication by f(x) followed by differentiation", in the prime factorization order.
%C A124796 Let d o f(x) be an operator of multiplication by f(x) followed by differentiation. (d o f)^m = Sum a([k0,k1,...])*((d^0 f)^k0*(d^1 f)^k1*...)*d^(m-k1-2*k2-...) where the sum is taken over all nonnegative integer vectors [k0,k1,...] such that k0+k1+...=m and k1+2*k2+...<=m.
%C A124796 It appears that a(2^k) = 1 and a(3^k) = 1 and that a(p) = 0 for prime p>3. - _Alexander Adamchuk_, Dec 03 2006
%F A124796 For n=p0^k0*p1^k1*... where 2=p0<p1<... are the sequence of all primes, a(n) = a([k0,k1,...]) satisfy the recurrence a([k0,k1,...]) = a([k0-1,k1,...]) + (k0+1)*a([k0,k1-1,...]) + Sum_{i=2..oo} (k(i-1)+1)*a([k0-1,k1,...,k(i-2),k(i-1)+1,ki-1,k(i+1),...]) with a([0,0,...])=1 and a([k0,k1,...])=0 as soon as some ki<0.
%F A124796 a([k0,k1,0,0,...]) = S(k0+k1+1,k0+1), Stirling number of the 2nd kind, see A008277.
