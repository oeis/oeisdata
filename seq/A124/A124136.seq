%N A124136 The list of primes p such that the number of primes in the open interval (p,2*p) is larger than the number of primes in the open interval (q,2*q) for all q<p.
%C A124136 Sequence A060715(n) lists the number of primes in the open interval (n,2*n).
%C A124136 If we extract its sublist for n a prime, the number of primes in the open interval (p,2*p), we have A070046(m) = 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 9, 9, 9, 11, 13, 12, 13, 14, 13, 15, 15, 16... for the primes p=2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 etc.
%C A124136 This sequence lists the primes p = prime(m) that set a new record in A070046(m).
%C A124136 Alternative definition: primes p defined by positions of records in A063124.
%e A124136 a(1)=prime(1)=2 with 1 prime in the interval (2,4). a(2) is neither 3 (with 1 prime in the interval (3,6)), nor 5 (with 1 prime in the interval (5,10)), but a(2)=7 with 2 primes in the interval (7,14).
%e A124136 The primes 41, 43 and 47 are not in the list because the intervals (41,82), (43,86) and (47,94) contain 9 primes, but the interval (37,74) with the smaller prime p=37 already contained 9 primes.
%e A124136 The prime 53 is in the list because the interval (53,106) contains 11 primes and the intervals (q,2*q) for primes q =2,3, 5, ..,47 contained 9 or less primes.
