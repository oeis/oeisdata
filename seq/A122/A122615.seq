%N A122615 Largest integer which cannot be written as a sum of n-th powers of primes.
%C A122615 The powers of only 3 primes are needed, namely 2^n, 3^n and 5^n, which leads to an ultra-fast O(n) execution time. I executed the algorithm in Greenberg (1988) with a PARI/GP program in only a few seconds for 1001 terms. - _Mike Oakes_, Aug 16 2016
%C A122615 Equivalent definition for this same sequence is "Largest integer which cannot be written as a sum of n-th powers of integers greater than 1". - _Mike Oakes_, Aug 17 2016

%e A122615 a(0) = 0 because all positive integers can be written as a sum of 0th powers of primes, i.e. as sums of 1.
%e A122615 a(1) = 1 because 2^1 = 2, 3^1 = 3, hence all positive integers 2 or larger can be written as a*2 + b*3 for a,b nonnegative integers [2 = 2, 3 = 3, 4 = 2+2, 5 = 2+3, 6 = 2+2+2 = 3+3, 7 = 2+2+3, ...].
%e A122615 a(2) = 23 because all integers 24 or larger can be written as a sum of squares and in fact as a sum of squares of primes.
%e A122615 a(3) = 154 because all integers 155 or larger can be written as a sum of cubes of primes.
