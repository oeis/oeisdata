%N A122113 Number of pairwise non-isomorphic biconnected planar bipartite graphs on n vertices.
%C A122113 Biconnected means "at least 2-connected". The corresponding sequence for 3-connected bipartite planar graph is A007028, where the term "polyhedral graph" is used as shorthand for "3-connected planar graph".
%H A122113 F. Hüffner, <a href="https://github.com/falk-hueffner/tinygraph">tinygraph</a>, software for generating integer sequences based on graph properties, version 9766535.
%e A122113 a(4) = 1 because the 4-cycle is the only planar and bipartite graph on 4 vertices that is at least 2-connected and a(5) = 1 because the complete bipartite graph K2,3 is the only such graph on 5 vertices.
%Y A122113 Cf. A007028.
