%N A122204 Signature permutations of ENIPS-transformations of non-recursive Catalan automorphisms in table A089840.
%C A122204 Row n is the signature permutation of the Catalan automorphism which is obtained from the n-th nonrecursive automorphism in the table A089840 with the recursion scheme "ENIPS". In this recursion scheme the algorithm first recurses down to the right-hand side branch of the binary tree, before the given automorphism is applied at its root. This corresponds to the fold-right operation applied to the Catalan structure, interpreted e.g. as a parenthesization or a Lisp-like list, where (lambda (x y) (f (cons x y))) is the binary function given to fold, with 'f' being the given automorphism. The associated Scheme-procedures ENIPS and !ENIPS can be used to obtain such a transformed automorphism from any constructively or destructively implemented automorphism. Each row occurs only once in this table. Inverses of these permutations can be found in table A122203.
%C A122204 Because of the "universal property of folds", the recursion scheme ENIPS has a well-defined inverse, that is, it acts as a bijective mapping on the set of all Catalan automorphisms. Specifically, if g = ENIPS(f), then (f s) = (g (cons (car s) (g^{-1} (cdr s)))), that is, to obtain an automorphism f which gives g when subjected to recursion scheme ENIPS, we compose g with its own inverse applied to the cdr-branch of a S-expression (i.e. the right subtree in the context of binary trees). This implies that for any non-recursive automorphism f in the table A089840, ENIPS^{-1}(f) is also in A089840, which in turn implies that the rows of table A089840 form a (proper) subset of the rows of this table.
