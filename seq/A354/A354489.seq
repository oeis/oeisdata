%N A354489 Widths w of w X h grid rectangles with w > h such that no quadrilaterals with 2 < h < w as defined in A353532 exist, whose angle between their diagonals is equal to the angle between the diagonals of the grid rectangle.
%C A354489 The relationship to A353532 is given by the fact that the number of lattice points n X m is used there, while here the side lengths of the lattice rectangle w = n - 1 and h = m - 1 are used.
