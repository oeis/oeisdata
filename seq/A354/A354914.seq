%N A354914 The least cost to reach n using additions and multiplications, where multiplication is free.
%C A354914 Start with 1. Apply multiplication or addition to any values (not necessarily distinct) already attained to get a finite sequence of integers ending in n. The cost of addition is one unit, but multiplication is free. Then a(n) is the cost of the least expensive path to n.
%C A354914 The problem is folklore. It is not hard to prove that the cost function is unbounded. The values given were produced by Joseph DeVincentis, Stan Wagon, and Al Zimmermann.
