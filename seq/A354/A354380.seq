%N A354380 Number of free pseudo-polytans with n cells.
%C A354380 A pseudo-polytan is a planar figure consisting of n isosceles right triangles joined either edge-to-edge or corner-to-corner, in such a way that the short edges of the triangles coincide with edges of the square lattice. Two figures are considered equivalent if they differ only by a rotation or reflection.
%C A354380 The pseudo-polytans are constructed in the same way as ordinary polytans (A006074), but allowing for corner-connections. Thus they generalize polytans in the same way that pseudo-polyominoes (aka polyplets, A030222) generalize ordinary polyominoes (A000105).
%H A354380 Aaron N. Siegel, <a href="/A354380/a354380.png">Illustration showing a(2) = 10</a>. The color of each figure corresponds to its number of symmetries.
%e A354380 a(2) = 10, because there are 10 ways of adjoining two isosceles right triangles: 3 distinct edge-to-edge joins (cf. A006074), and 7 distinct corner-to-corner joins.
%Y A354380 Cf. A006074, A000105, A030222, A337867, A354403 (one-sided), A354405 (fixed).
