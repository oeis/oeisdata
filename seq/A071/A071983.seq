%N A071983 Square chains: the number of permutations (reversals not counted as different) of the numbers 1 to n such that the sum of any two consecutive numbers is a square.
%C A071983 For n > 31, this sequence counts each circular solution (in which the first and last numbers also sum to a square) n times. Sequence A090460 counts the circular solutions only once, giving the number of essentially different solutions.
%C A071983 The existence of cubic chains in answered affirmatively in Puzzle 311. - _T. D. Noe_, Jun 16 2005
