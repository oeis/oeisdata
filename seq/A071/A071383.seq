%N A071383 Squared radii of the circles around (0,0) that contain record numbers of lattice points.
%C A071383 The number of lattice points (i,j) on the circle with i^2 + j^2 = a(n) is given by A071385(n).
%C A071383 In a sci.math posting on May 05 2002 entitled "Circle with 3 lattice points", _James R. Buddenhagen_ asked: Which circles have the property that they pass through more lattice points than any smaller circle? and he gave the terms 1, 25, 65, 325, 1105, 4225, 5525, with the missing 5 added by Ahmed Fares. In the same thread _Gerry Myerson_ mentioned the factorization into primes of the form 4*k+1.
%C A071383 Also, numbers with a record number of divisors all of whose prime factors are of the form 4k + 1. - _Amiram Eldar_, Sep 12 2019
%C A071383 Indices of records of A004018. Apart from the first term, also indices of records of A002654. - _Jianing Song_, May 20 2021

%F A071383 For n>1 we have 1 < a(n+1)/a(n) <= 5, since one can multiply the points x+iy for which x^2 + y^2 = N by either 2+i or 2-i to get two new sets of points X+iY for which X^2 + Y^2 = 5N. This strictly increases the number since it is easy to see that the two sets aren't the same. - _J. H. Conway_, Jun 04 2002
