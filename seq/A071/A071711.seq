%N A071711 Let s(k) denote the k-th term of an integer sequence such that s(0)=0 and s(i) for all i>0 is the least natural number such that no four elements of {s(0),..,s(i)} are in arithmetic progression. Then it appears that there are many set of 3 consecutive integers in s(k). Sequence gives the smallest element in those triples.
%C A071711 Presumably there are infinitely many such triples.
