%N A137820 Record indices of the ratio A002375(n) / n (Goldbach conjecture related).
%C A137820 The sequence lists indices n for which A002375(n)/n is less than for all previous indices n > 2, or equivalently, assuming that A002375(n) > 0 for all n > 2 (Goldbach conjecture), values for which n/A002375(n) is greater than for all previous indices n > 2.
%C A137820 We do not consider indices n = 1 and n = 2, for which the sequence A002375(n) (= number of prime {p,q} such that 2n = p+q) is zero.
%C A137820 Note also that A045917 = A002375 except for n = 2; since we exclude n < 3, one can equivalently replace one of these two with the other in the definition.
%C A137820 In A002375, an upper bound for A002375(n) is given; however, the Goldbach conjecture is A002375(n) > 0 for all n > 2, thus rather connected to the question of a lower bound. This sequence lists values of n for which A002375(n) is particularly low.
%C A137820 If the conjecture is wrong, then this sequence A137820 is finite: It will end with the counterexample n such that A002375(n) = 0, i.e., 2n cannot be written as the sum of 2 primes.
%C A137820 Conjecture: All terms of this sequence are of the form 2^i, 2^i*p, or 2^i*p*q where i >= 0 and p and q not necessarily distinct odd primes. - _Craig J. Beisel_, Jun 15 2020
