%N A137414 Number of possible outcomes after n steps of the Zeno gambling process.
%C A137414 The player begins with x=1/2, and wins or loses min(x/2,(1-x)/2) at each step.
%C A137414 After step n, the player has x=d/2^(n+1), where d is an odd number between 0 and 2^(n+1).
%C A137414 How dense are the numbers at level n of the Zeno tree, as a proportion of the 2^n numbers that might be there? This data suggests that the density scales by about 0.72 at each step.
%C A137414 (The 45/128,83/128 near the bottom of the lower figure on p. 196 of Hayes (2008) should be 47/128,81/128.)

%e A137414 a(1)=2 because {1/4,3/4} are possible outcomes after 1 step.
%e A137414 a(2)=4 because {1/8,3/8,5/8,7/8} are possible after 2 steps.
%e A137414 a(3)=6 because {1,3,7,9,13,15}/16 are possible after 3 steps.
