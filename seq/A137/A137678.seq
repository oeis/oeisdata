%N A137678 Consider the consecutive composite numbers between prime(n) and prime(n+1). Letting k = prime(n+1)-prime(n)-1, a(n) is the number of these numbers that have all prime factors less than k.
%C A137678 Grimm's conjecture states that for k consecutive composite numbers there are k distinct prime numbers such that each prime divides one of the composite numbers. As pointed out by Grimm, for a composite number c having a prime factor p>=k, we associate p with c. Hence there are only a(n) numbers remaining between prime(n) and prime(n+1) for which we need to associate a distinct prime. Puzzle 430 gives a heuristic algorithm for finding those a(n) primes. According to Puzzle 430, the largest known value of a(n) is 10, which occurs between the primes 31397 and 31469.

%e A137678 a(4)=1 because of the 3 numbers between 7 and 11 (8=2^3, 9=3^2, 10=2*5), only 8 has all of its prime factors less than 3. Similarly, a(9)=2 because of the 5 numbers between 23 and 29, only 24 and 27 have all prime factors less than 5.
