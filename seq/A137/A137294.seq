%N A137294 A polynomial-time algorithm for moving all seeds into one pot in a class of sowing positions.
%C A137294 a(n) is asymptotic to O(n^(log base 2 of 3)) according to the reference.
%C A137294 The reference also gives a(2^k) = 1/2 (3^k - 1).
%C A137294 Numerical experiments indicate that a(n) ~ 0.5 or 0.6 * n^(log base 2 of 3). The coefficient seems to oscillate back and forth between 0.5 and 0.6.
%C A137294 The reference also points out that it is possible, by choosing a less efficient recursive algorithm for getting all the seeds in one pot, to simulate the Towers of Hanoi algorithm and obtain 2^(n-1) - 1 moves for a(n) instead.

%F A137294 T(1) = 0; T(2m) = 3T(m) + 1; T(2m+1) = 2T(m) + T(m+1) + 2 (from p. 289 of Erickson in Nowakowski reference above).
%e A137294 Starting with 1 all the seeds are already in one pot so a(1) = 0 moves.
%e A137294 Starting with 11, move to 2, so a(2) = 1.
%e A137294 Starting with 111, move to 201 and then 012 and then 003, so a(3) = 3 moves.
%e A137294 Starting with 1111, move to 0211, 0202, 0013, 0004, so a(4) = 4 moves.
%e A137294 Starting with 11111, move to 02111, 02102, 03002, 00113, 00203, 00014, 00005, a(5) = 7 moves.
%Y A137294 Cf. A000225 is the Towers of Hanoi sequence. A003462 has a(2^n).
