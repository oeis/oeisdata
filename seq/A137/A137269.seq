%N A137269 Number of primes with maximal digit product for a digit sum of n.
%C A137269 From _Chai Wah Wu_, Dec 04 2015, Nov 03 2018: (Start)
%C A137269 If n > 3 and n == 0 (mod 3) then a(n) = 0 since the digit sum is a multiple of 3.
%C A137269 Primes with digit product maximal among all numbers with the same digit sum (not just maximal among primes) only contain the digits 2, 3 or 4. A digit 0 leads to a digit product 0 which is not maximal. A digit 1 with another digit d (since 1 is not prime, there must be another digit d) can be replaced with the digit d+1 (if d < 9) which preserves the digit sum, but strictly increases the digit product (if d = 9, 1 and 9 can be replaced with 3, 3 and 4 which again increases the digit product). For a digit d > 4, there is a series of digits from the set {2,3,4} whose sum is d and whose product is strictly larger than d. For instance, 5 -> {2,3} whose product is 6. 6 -> {3,3}, 7 -> {3,4}, 8 -> {2,3,3}, 9 -> {3,3,3}. Thus the digit d in a number can be replaced with digits 2, 3, 4 to obtain a number with the same digit sum and a larger digit product. Furthermore, the digits 2 and 4 cannot both appear, the digit 2 cannot appear more than twice and the digit 4 cannot appear more than once since {3,3} also sums to 6 and has product 9 > 8.
%C A137269 This analysis implies the following for n > 3. If n == 1 (mod 3), then primes with maximal digit product among all numbers with the same digit sum (if they exist) have digits 3 and either two digits 2 or a single digit 4. If n == 2 (mod 3), then primes with maximal digit product among all numbers with the same digit sum (if they exist) have digits 3 and a single digit 2. Values for n for which such primes do not exist are 4, 38, 46, 65, 94, ...  In these cases a(n) can still be > 0, but the digit product of these primes is not maximal among all numbers with digit sum n. So far, it seems that in these cases (except for n = 4) these primes also only contain the digits 2, 3, or 4.
