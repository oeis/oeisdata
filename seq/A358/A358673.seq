%N A358673 Numbers k such that for all factorizations of k as x*y, the sum (x * y') + (x' * y) is carryfree when the addition is done in the primorial base, A049345. Here n' stands for A003415(n), the arithmetic derivative of n.
%C A358673 Numbers k such that there are no factorization of k into such a pair of natural numbers x and y, that the sum (x * A003415(y)) + (A003415(x) * y) would generate any carries when the addition is done in the primorial base.
