%N A358763 Numbers k for which bigomega(k) == 3 (mod 4).
%C A358763 Numbers k such that number of their prime factors (when counted with multiplicity, with A001222) is of the form 4n+3: 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, ..., A004767.
%C A358763 Equally, numbers k for which A349905(k) == 3 (mod 4).

%F A358763 {k | A010873(A349905(k)) = 3}.
%e A358763 128 = 2^7 has 7 prime factors in total, and 7 is a number of the form 4n+3 (in A004767), therefore 128 is included in this sequence. Or equivalently, because A349905(128) = 5103 = 4*1275 + 3.
