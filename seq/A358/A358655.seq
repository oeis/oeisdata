%N A358655 a(n) is the number of distinct scalar products which can be formed by pairs of signed permutations (V, W) of [n].
%C A358655 Let V be an n-vector of the numbers 1 to n in order and let W be an n-vector of any signed permutation of these numbers. Numbers in W may be either positive or negative. a(n) is the number of different values for the scalar product V*W for all possible W. We allow all combinations of positive and negative signs in W.
%C A358655 Another interpretation of this sequence: A signed permutohedron is also called the Coxeter permutohedron of the family C_n and has A000165(n) vertices. If we choose a vector of one vertex of such a permutohedron to the origin, and cut this permutohedron in slices by hyperplanes which are orthogonal to this vector such that in each slice lies at least one vertex of this permutohedron, then a(n) is the count of such slices obtained by this process.
%C A358655 a(n) is odd if the plane through the origin is occupied by vertices, this means A358629(n) > 0.
%C A358655 For n > 3 all possible planes are occupied by vertices and thus a nice formula ( see formula section ) exists.
%C A358655 The permutohedra for small n are:
%C A358655   n = 2 Octagon.
%C A358655   n = 3 Truncated cuboctahedron.
%C A358655   n = 4 Omnitruncated tesseract.
%C A358655   n = 5 Omnitruncated 5-cube.
