%N A014627 Consider all complete bipartite graphs on 2n nodes and all possible assignment of weights w(i) (for nodes i=1,...,2n); sequence gives maximal number of ways to orient the edges of the graph so that each node i has w(i) edges oriented towards it (for i=1,...,2n).

%e A014627 For n=2 the maximal bipartite graph has two nodes on each side and the weight of every node 1. The edges form a path which can be oriented forwards or backwards to give exactly one edge oriented towards each node. Thus for n=2 the sequence value is 2.
