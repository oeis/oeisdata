%N A014617 Antidiagonals of the prime-composite array B(m,n) (see A067681) that are zeros from the first Borve conjecture.
%C A014617 Let c(m) be the m-th composite and p(n) be the n-th prime. The prime-composite array, B, is defined such that each element B(m,n) is the highest power of p(n) that is contained within c(m). The m-th antidiagonal of the array consists of the m elements B(m,1), B(m-1,2), B(m-2,3), ..., B(1,m). The First Borve Conjecture states that there are infinitely many zero-only antidiagonals.

%e A014617 Each composite has its own row, consisting of the indices of its prime factors. For example, the 10th composite is 18 and 18 = 2^1 * 3^2 * 5^0 * 7^0 * 11^0 * ..., so the 10th row reads: 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, ... Similarly, B(6,2) = 1 because c(6) = 12, p(2) = 3 and the highest power of 3 contained within 12 is 3^1 = 3. And B(34,3) = 2 because c(34) = 50, p(3) = 5 and the highest power of 5 contained within 50 is 5^2 = 25.
