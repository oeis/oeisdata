%N A039004 Numbers whose base-4 representation has the same number of 1's and 2's.

%C A039004 Conjecture: a(C(2n,n)-1) = 4^n - 1. (A000984 is C(2n,n)). - _Gerald McGarvey_, Nov 18 2007
%C A039004 From _Russell Jay Hendel_, Jun 23 2015: (Start)
%C A039004 We prove the McGarvey conjecture (A) a(e(n,n)-1) = 4^n-1, with e(n,m) = A034870(n,m) = binomial(2n,m), the even rows of Pascal's triangle. By the comment from Hendel in A034870, we have the function s(n,k) = #{n-digit, base-4 numbers with n-k more 1-digits than 2-digits}. As shown in A034870, (B) #s(n,k)= e(n,k) with # indicating cardinality, that is, e(n,k) = binomial(2n,k) gives the number of n-digit, base-4 numbers with n-k more 1-digits than 2-digits.
%C A039004 We now show that (B) implies (A). By definition, s(n,n) contains the e(n,n) = binomial(2n,n) numbers with an equal number of 1-digits and 2-digits. The biggest n-digit, base-4 number is 333...3 (n copies of 3). Since 333...33 has zero 1-digits and zero 2-digits it follows that 333...333 is a member of s(n,n) and hence it is the biggest member of s(n,n). But 333...333 (n copies of 3) in base 4 has value 4^n-1. Since A039004 starts with index 0 (that is, 0 is the 0th member of A039004), it immediately follows that 4^n-1 is the (e(n,n)-1)st member of A039004, proving the McGarvey conjecture. (End)
%C A039004 Also numbers whose alternating sum of binary expansion is 0, i.e., positions of zeros in A345927. These are numbers whose binary expansion has the same number of 1's at even positions as at odd positions. - _Gus Wiseman_, Jul 28 2021

%F A039004 Conjecture: there is a constant c around 5 such that a(n) is asymptotic to c*n. - _Benoit Cloitre_, Nov 24 2002
%F A039004 That conjecture is false. The number of members of the sequence from 0 to 4^d-1 is binomial(2d,d) which by Stirling's formula is asymptotic to 4^d/sqrt(Pi*d). If Cloitre's conjecture were true we would have 4^d-1 asymptotic to c*4^d/sqrt(Pi*d), a contradiction. - _Robert Israel_, Jun 24 2015
