%N A110952 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) = number of permutations of [n] where the first increasing run has length k and the last increasing run has length n-k-1, 0<k<n-1.
%C A110952 Permutations of [n] with exactly 2 descents and the descents are adjacent. Adjusting for initial index: row sums are A045618; first diagonal is A000217, the triangular numbers; 2nd diagonal is A051925; and 3rd diagonal is A001701, generalized Stirling numbers.
