%N A110387 a(1) = 1, a(2) = a(1) + 1, a(3) = a(2)^2 + a(1) + 1; a(n+1) = a(n)^n + a(n-1)^(n-1) + ... + a(2)^2 + a(1) + 1.
%C A110387 The next term is too large to include.
%C A110387 a(n) = the number of ordered trees with root degree at most n-1 and having strictly thinning limbs. An ordered tree with strictly thinning limbs is such that if a vertex has k children, each of its children has fewer than k children. For example, we have a(1) = 1 (the 1-vertex tree) and a(2)=1 (the 1-vertex tree and the 1-edge tree). From here one obtains easily (i) the recurrence relation for a(n+1) given in NAME (the terms in the right-hand side count successively the trees with root degrees n-1, n-2, ..., 1, 0, respectively) and also (ii) the recurrence relation for a(n) given in FORMULA (the first term in the right-hand side counts the trees with root degree at most n-2 and  the second term counts the trees with root degree n-1). Moreover, it follows that the terms of this sequence are the partial sums of the sequence obtained from A248099 by extending it with A248099(0) = 1. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Aug 11 2015
