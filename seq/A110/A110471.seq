%e A110471 a(4) = 0 because 4 (base 2) = 100, which has 2 (prime) consecutive zeros.
%e A110471 a(8) = 0 because 8 (base 2) = 1000, which has 3 (prime) consecutive zeros.
%e A110471 a(9) = 0 because 9 (base 2) = 1001, which has 2 (prime) consecutive zeros.
%e A110471 a(16) = 1 because 16 (base 2) = 10000, which has 4 (composite) consecutive zeros, even though there are sub-blocks of zeros of lengths 2 and 3.
%e A110471 a(32) = 0 because 32 (base 2) = 100000, which has 5 (prime) consecutive zeros.
