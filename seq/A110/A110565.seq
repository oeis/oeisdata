%N A110565 Results from a change in the rules leading to sequence A097357.
%C A110565 Let b_n(i) be defined as for sequence A097357. Then A097357(n) = Sum_{i>=0} b_n(i) = Sum_{i=1..n} b_n(i). We have:
%C A110565   Stage 1: (1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0) = b_1 (disregarding initial 0);
%C A110565   Stage 2: (1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0) = b_2 (disregarding initial 0);
%C A110565   Stage 3: (0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0) = b_3 (disregarding initial 0);
%C A110565   Stage 4: (0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0) = b_4 (disregarding initial 0);
%C A110565   Stage 5: (1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0) = b_5 (disregarding initial 0);
%C A110565   Stage 6: (1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)
%C A110565   Stage 7: (1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0)
%C A110565   Stage 8: (1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0)
%C A110565 a(n) is defined as the number which results from interpreting the sequence b_n as a binary string read backwards from the first nonzero term.
%e A110565 a(6) = 53 since b_6 = (1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0) and 110101 written in base 10 is 53.
%Y A110565 Cf. A097357.
