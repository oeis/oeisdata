%N A110303 Alternators.
%C A110303 An alternating integer is a positive integer for which, in base-10, the parity of its digits alternates. E.g., 121 is alternating because its consecutive digits are odd-even-odd, 1 being odd and 2 even. Of course, 1234567890 is also alternating. An alternator is a positive integer which has a multiple which is alternating.

%F A110303 Positive n, not congruent to 0 mod 20.
%F A110303 a(n + 19) = a(n) + 20. - _David A. Corneth_, Apr 13 2021
%e A110303 11 is an alternator and in the sequence because it has a multiple which is alternating. The least of these multiples is 121.
