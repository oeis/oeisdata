%N A080933 Smallest non-occurring pairwise difference between the elements of a Mian-Chowla sequence (A005282) variant starting with (1,n).
%C A080933 For large n the sequence consists of increasingly long runs of "33", which is the first term of A080200 (the smallest non-occurring difference in A005282), with some interspersed other terms. E.g. for n=100000..100100 we have a(n)=88 for n=100005,100021,100041,100087,100099, a(100072)=98 and otherwise a(n)=33.

%e A080933 a(2)=33 because the smallest non-occurring pairwise difference between the terms of A005282 (starting with 1,2) is A080200(1)=33. a(3)=49 because the smallest non-occurring pairwise difference between the terms of A051788 (starting with 1,3) is A080201(1)=49. a(4)=26 because the smallest non-occurring pairwise difference between the terms of A058335 (starting with 1,4) is A080932(1)=26.
