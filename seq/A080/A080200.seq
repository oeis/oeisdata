%N A080200 Numbers that do not occur as differences between terms of the Mian-Chowla sequence A005282.
%C A080200 This sequence was suggested by _Jens Voß_, Feb 04 2003. Terms are only conjectures. Elements might be eliminated by higher terms of A005282, which was checked up to 4*10^6.
%C A080200 Terms through a(50) confirmed by checking against first 25000 terms of A005282. - _Hugo Pfoertner_, Nov 13 2021
