%N A080981 A014486-encodings of the trees whose interior zigzag-tree (Stanley's c) is branch-reduced (in the sense defined by Donaghey).
%C A080981 Donaghey defines (on page 82 of his paper) the branch-reduced zigzag-trees as those zigzag-trees which do not contain longer than one-edge branches, where a branch is a maximal connected set of edges slanted to the same direction, with no perpendicular edges emanating from its middle. These form the primitive elements of the automorphism A057505/A057506.
