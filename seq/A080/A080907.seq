%N A080907 Numbers whose aliquot sequence terminates in a 1.
%C A080907 All primes are in this set because s(p) = 1 for p prime. Perfect numbers are clearly not in this set. Neither are aspiring numbers (A063769), or numbers whose aliquot sequence is a cycle (such as 220 and 284).
%C A080907 There are some numbers whose aliquot sequences haven't been fully determined (such as 276).

%F A080907 n is a member if n = 1 or s(n) is a member, where s(n) is the sum of the proper factors of n.
%e A080907 4 is in this set because its aliquot chain is 4->3->1. 6 is not in this set because it is perfect. 25 is not in this set because its aliquot chain is 25->6.
