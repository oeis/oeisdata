%N A080092 Irregular triangle read by rows, giving prime sequences (p-1|2n) appearing in the n-th von Staudt-Clausen sum.
%C A080092 From _Gary W. Adamson_ & _Mats Granvik_, Aug 09 2008: (Start)
%C A080092 The von Staudt-Clausen theorem has two parts: generating denominators of the B_2n and the actual values. Both operations can be demonstrated in triangles A143343 and A080092 by following the procedures outlined in [Wikipedia - Bernoulli numbers] and summarized in A143343.
%C A080092 A046886(n-1) = number of terms in row n.
%C A080092 The same terms in A143343 may be extracted from triangle A138239.
%C A080092 Extract primes from even numbered rows of triangle A143343 but also include "2" as row 1. The rows are thus 1, 2, 4, 6, ..., generating denominators of B_1, B_2, B_4, ..., as well as B_1, B_2, B_4, ..., as two parts of the von Staudt-Clausen theorem.
%C A080092 The denominator of B_12 = 2730 = 2*3*5*7*13 = A027642(12) and A002445(6).
%C A080092 For example, B_12 = -691/2730 = (1 - 1/2 - 1/3 - 1/5 - 1/7 - 1/13).
%C A080092 The second operation is the von Staudt-Clausen representation of Bn, obtained by starting with "1" and then subtracting the reciprocals of terms in each row. (Cf. A143343 for a detailed explanation of the operations.) (End)
