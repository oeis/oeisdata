%N A080545 Characteristic function of {1} union {odd primes}: 1 if n is 1 or an odd prime, else 0.

%F A080545 a(n) = (delta(Omega(n), 0) + delta(Omega(n), 1)) * d_0(n), where delta is the Kronecker delta function, Omega is the number of prime factors function (counted with multiplicity), and d_0(n) is the least significant digit of n in binary. - _Alonso del Arte_, Nov 19 2013
%e A080545 a(2) = 0 because 2 is prime but even.
%e A080545 a(3) = 1 because 3 is prime and odd. Likewise for a(5) and a(7).
%e A080545 a(4) = 0 because 4 is neither prime nor odd. Likewise for a(6) and a(8).
%e A080545 a(9) = 0 because 9 is odd but composite.
