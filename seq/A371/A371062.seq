%N A371062 Number of one-sided generalized polyforms on the tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb with n cells.
%C A371062 This sequence counts "one-sided" polyforms where holes are allowed. This means that two polyforms are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other. However, reflections of chiral polytopes are considered distinct.
%C A371062 The ratio a(n)/A343909(n) -> 2 as n -> infinity.
