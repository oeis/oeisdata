%N A371022 Numbers k with the property that there is a finite set W of groups of order divisible by k such that if k divides the order of a group G, then G has a subgroup isomorphic to a group in W.
%C A371022 These are called Cauchy numbers in Cameron et al., where they are proved to be the following set: 6 U prime powers U numbers of the form 2*p^a where p is a Fermat prime greater than 3.
