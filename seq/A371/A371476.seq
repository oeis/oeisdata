%N A371476 a(n) is the number of free polyominoes of size n with at least one solution to the One Up puzzle (see comments).
%C A371476 The objective of the One Up puzzle is to assign a positive integer to each cell of a given polyomino in such a way that the cells of any maximal 1 X k strip (horizontal or vertical) are numbered 1, ..., k (in some order). (In an extended version of the puzzle, there may be walls between certain pairs of neighboring cells, and only those strips that do not extend over a wall are considered.)
