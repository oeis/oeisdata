%N A193765 The number of dominoes in the largest saturated domino covering of the n X n board plus one (n >= 2).
%C A193765 A domino covering of a board is saturated if the removal of any domino leaves an uncovered cell.
%C A193765 In a domino covering of an n X n board, a domino is redundant if its removal leaves a covering of the board. a(n) is the smallest size of board  for which any domino covering must include a redundant domino.

%e A193765 If you completely cover a 2 X 2 board with 3 dominoes, you can remove one and the board will still be covered. Hence a(2) >= 3. On the other hand, you can tile the 2 by 2 board with 2 dominoes and a removal of one of them will leave both cells uncovered. Hence a(2) = 3.
