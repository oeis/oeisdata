%N A193429 a(n) = minimum value of the largest element of a nonempty set of positive integers > n such that their product is equal to n!, or 0 if no such set exists.
%C A193429 From _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Jul 28 2011: (Start)
%C A193429 For n > 4, there is always the factorization n! = (2*n) * (n!/(2*n)), so a(n) is only 0 for n = 1 or 2.
%C A193429 It appears that this sequence is O(n). (End)

%e A193429 For n=5, n! = 120. Any factorization of 120 into 3 (or more) factors will have a factor <= 5, so we take the most central factorization into two factors, 120 = 10*12, the maximum of {10, 12} is 12, thus a(5) = 12.
