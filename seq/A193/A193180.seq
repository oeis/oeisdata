%N A193180 The decimal expansion of the value of d that maximizes the expression (1+1/(1-d)+1/(1-2d))*(-1+1/(1-d)+1/(1-2d))*(1-1/(1-d)+1/(1-2d))*(1+1/(1-d)-1/(1-2d)) for d in the interval [-inf, 1/2] where 1/(1-d) and 1/(1-2d) are always positive.
%C A193180 If the sides of a triangle form a harmonic progression in the ratio 1 : 1/(1-d) : 1/(1-2d) then when d = 0.2158561226... it uniquely maximizes the area of the triangle. This triangle has approximate internal angles of 33.956, 45.423 and 100.621 degrees.
