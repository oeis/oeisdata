%N A193351 Numbers k such that A071324(k) is prime.
%C A193351 Numbers k such that the alternating sum of all divisors of k (divisors nonincreasing, starting with k) is prime.
%C A193351 The corresponding primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 43, 31, 43, 61, 157, ...
%C A193351 It is interesting to note that all numbers except the first are squares, or twice a square, hence the conjecture:
%C A193351 For k > 3, if the alternating sum of all divisors of k (divisors nonincreasing, starting with k) is a prime number, then k is either a square or twice a square.
%C A193351 Nevertheless, the difficulty is only for the even numbers. The odd numbers k are necessarily square because the number of divisors of an integer j is odd if and only if j is a square => the alternate sum of the odd divisors is odd.
%C A193351 For large k, the asymptotic law of the ratio r = (number of squares) / (number of twice squares) seems to be r ~ 1. For example, for k < 10^6 we obtain 213 primes corresponding to 118 squares and 95 twice squares.
%C A193351 Similar considerations such as those discussed for the odd squares also exist for the sequence A023194 (numbers k such that sigma(k) is prime). All numbers k except the first are squares, and each number of this sequence is a prime power => sigma(k) is odd.

%e A193351 169 is in the sequence because the divisors of 169 are 1, 13, 169 and 169 - 13 + 1 = 157 is prime.
