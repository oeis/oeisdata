%N A193351 Numbers k such that A071324(k) is prime.
%C A193351 Numbers k such that the alternating sum of all divisors of k (divisors nonincreasing, starting with k) is prime.
%C A193351 The corresponding primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 43, 31, 43, 61, 157, ...
%C A193351 It is interesting to note that all numbers except the first are squares, or twice a square, hence the conjecture:
%C A193351 For k > 3, if the alternating sum of all divisors of k (divisors nonincreasing, starting with k) is a prime number, then k is either a square or twice a square.
%C A193351 This conjecture is verified up to k <= 10^8. - _Shreyansh Jaiswal_, Apr 25 2025
%C A193351 Nevertheless, the difficulty is only for the even numbers. The odd numbers k are necessarily square because the number of divisors of an integer j is odd if and only if j is a square => the alternate sum of the odd divisors is odd.
%C A193351 For large k, the asymptotic law of the ratio r = (number of squares) / (number of twice squares) seems to be r ~ 1. For example, for k < 10^6 we obtain 213 primes corresponding to 118 squares and 95 twice squares.
%C A193351 Similar considerations such as those discussed for the odd squares also exist for the sequence A023194 (numbers k such that sigma(k) is prime). All numbers k except the first are squares, and each number of this sequence is a prime power => sigma(k) is odd.
%C A193351 From _Shreyansh Jaiswal_, Apr 19 2025: (Start)
%C A193351 For k < 10^6, the ratio r is 118/95, approximately 1.24. For k <= 10^8, there are 815 perfect squares and 546 twice squares. This gives r = 815/546, which is approximately 1.49. This computational data does not hint that r ~ 1.
%C A193351 Interestingly, out of the first 400 terms, 245 terms can be represented as a sum of two distinct positive integer squares.
%C A193351 Another interesting aspect is terms of the form 10^n. For 1 <= n <= 500, only n = 8 (corresponding to 10^8) is a term in the sequence. It appears that terms of the form 10^n are quite uncommon. (End)
