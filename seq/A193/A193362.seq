%e A193362 For n = 2, the a(2) = 31 dissections of the disc into 6n = 12 curvilinear triangles are:
%e A193362 * 1 solution in which 1 piece does not touch the center;
%e A193362 * 5 solutions in which 2 pieces do not touch the center;
%e A193362 * 10 solutions in which 3 pieces do not touch the center;
%e A193362 * 10 solutions in which 4 pieces do not touch the center;
%e A193362 * 3 solutions in which 5 pieces do not touch the center;
%e A193362 * 2 symmetrical solutions, one of which is exceptional.
