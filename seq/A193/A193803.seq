%N A193803 Length of perfect Wichmann rulers.
%C A193803 R is a perfect Wichmann ruler iff R is a perfect ruler (for definition see A103294) and there exist two integers r>=0 and s>=0 such that the type of the difference representation of the ruler is [1*r, r+1, (2r+1)*r, (4r+3)*s, (2r+2)*(r+1), 1*r].
