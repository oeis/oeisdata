%N A250240 Fundamental discriminants d uniquely characterizing all complex biquadratic fields Q(sqrt(-3),sqrt(d)) which have 3-class group of type (3,3) and second 3-class group isomorphic to SmallGroup(729,37).
%C A250240 For the discriminants d in A250240, the 3-class field tower of K=Q(sqrt(-3),sqrt(d)) has at least three stages and the second 3-class group G of K is given by G=SmallGroup(729,37), which is called the non-CF group A by Ascione, Havas and Leedham-Green. It has many properties (transfer kernel type b.10, (0,0,4,3), and transfer target type [(3,9)^2,(3,3,3)^2]) coinciding with those of SmallGroup(729,34), called the non-CF group H. Both are immediate descendants of SmallGroup(243,3) and can only be distinguished by their commutator subgroup G', which is of type (3,3,9) for A, and (3,3,3,3) for H.
%C A250240 Since the verification of the structure of G' requires computation of the 3-class group of the Hilbert 3-class field of K, which is of absolute degree 36 over Q, the construction of A250240 is extremely tough.
%C A250240 Whereas the metabelian 3-group A is rather well behaved, possessing six terminal immediate descendants only, the notorious group H is famous for giving rise to three infinite coclass trees with non-metabelian mainlines and horrible complexity.
%C A250240 In 66.2 hours of CPU time, Magma computed all 34 discriminants d up to the bound 50000. Starting with d=38057, Magma begins to struggle considerably, since an increasing amount of time (NOT included above) is used for swapping to the hard disk. - _Daniel Constantin Mayer_, Dec 02 2014
%C A250240 The given Magma PROG works correctly up to 10000. However, for ranges beyond 10000, a complication arises, since the non-CF group B = SmallGroup(729,40) also has a commutator subgroup of type (3,3,9) and must be sifted with the aid of its different transfer target type [(9,9),(3,9),(3,3,3)^2]. Up to 50000, this occurs three times for d in {17609,30941,31516}. - _Daniel Constantin Mayer_, Dec 05 2014
%C A250240 The group G=SmallGroup(729,37) has p-multiplicator rank m(G)=5. By Theorem 6 of I. R. Shafarevich (with misprint corrected) the relation rank of the 3-class tower group H is bounded by r(H) <= d(H) + r + 1 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4, where d(H) denotes the generator rank of H and r is the torsionfree unit rank of K. Thus, G with r(G) >= m(G) = 5 cannot be the 3-class tower group of K and the tower must have at least three stages. - _Daniel Constantin Mayer_, Sep 24 2015
