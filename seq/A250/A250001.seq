%N A250001 Number of arrangements of n circles in the affine plane.
%C A250001 We count only configurations where any two circles are either disjoint or meet in two points: We do not allow tangential contacts. A point on a circle must belong to only one or at most two circles: Three circles must not meet at a point. The circles may have different radii.
%C A250001 This is in the affine plane, rather than the projective plane.
%C A250001 Two arrangements are considered the same if one can be continuously changed to the other while keeping all circles circular (although the radii may be continuously changed), without changing the multiplicity of intersection points, and without a circle passing through an intersection point. Turning the whole configuration over is allowed.
%C A250001 Several variations are possible:
%C A250001 - straight lines instead of circles (see A241600).
%C A250001 - straight lines in general position (see A090338).
%C A250001 - curved lines in general position (see A090339).
%C A250001 - allow circles to meet tangentially but without multiple intersection points (begins 1, 5, ...); more terms are needed.
%C A250001 - again use circles, but allow multiple intersection points (also begins 1, 5, ...); more terms are needed.
%C A250001 - use ellipses rather than circles.
%C A250001 - a question from Walter D. Wallis: what if the circles must all have the same radius?
%C A250001 a(1)-a(5) computed by _Jon Wild_.
%C A250001 a(n) >= A000081(n+1) - _Benoit Jubin_, Dec 21 2014. More precisely, there are A000081(n+1) ways to arrange n circles if no two of them meet. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, May 16 2017
%C A250001 From _Daniel Forgues_, Aug 08-09 2015: (Start)
%C A250001 A representation for the diagrams in a250001.jpg (in the same order):
%C A250001   a(1) =  1: {{2}};
%C A250001   a(2) =  3: {{2, 3}, {2, 4}, {4, 6}};
%C A250001   a(3) = 14: {{2, 4, 8}, {2, 3, 6}, {2, 3, 4}, {2, 3, 5}, {4, 6, 5},
%C A250001     {4, 6, 15}, {2, 6, 9}, {4, 6, 12}, {2, 8, 12}, {30, 42, 70},
%C A250001     {?, ?, ?}, {?, ?, ?}, {15, 21, 35}, {?, ?, ?}}.
%C A250001 In lexicographic order:
%C A250001   a(3) = 14: {{2, 3, 4}, {2, 3, 5}, {2, 3, 6}, {2, 4, 8}, {2, 6, 9},
%C A250001     {2, 8, 12}, {4, 6, 5}, {4, 6, 12}, {4, 6, 15}, {15, 21, 35},
%C A250001     {30, 42, 70}, {?, ?, ?}, {?, ?, ?}, {?, ?, ?}}.
%C A250001 The smallest integers greater than 1 are used for the representation:
%C A250001   (p_1)^(a_1)*...*(p_m)^(a_m), where
%C A250001   0 <= a_i <= n, for 1 <= i <= m;
%C A250001   (a_1)+...+(a_m) > 0.
%C A250001 Could the Venn diagram interpretation (of the k-wise, 1 <= k <= n, common divisors of k numbers from each subset) reveal a pattern?
%C A250001 Does this representation work for more complex diagrams? (End)
%C A250001 Once you get to n=5, geometric concerns mean that not all topologically-conceivable arrangements are actually circle-drawable.  My program enumerated 16977 conceivable arrangements of 5 pseudo-circles, and Christopher Jones and I together have figured out how to show that 26 of these arrangements are not actually circle-drawable. So it seems that a(5) = 16951. This entry will be updated soon, and there will be a new sequence for the number of topologically-conceivable arrangements. - _Jon Wild_, Aug 25 2016 [The counts in this comment were amended by _Jon Wild_ on Aug 30 2016. I apologize for taking so long to make the corrections here. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jun 11 2017]
%C A250001 a(n) <= 7*13^(binomial(n,3) + binomial(n,2) + 3n - 1) is a (loose) upper bound, see Reddit link. I believe XkF21WNJ's reply shaves off a factor of 13^3 from this bound for all n > 1. - _Linus Hamilton_, Apr 14 2019
%C A250001 A good upper bound for a(6) is given in sequence A288559, which counts the arrangements of pseudo-circles, i.e. the topologically conceivable arrangements mentioned above, which are not all necessarily realizable with true circles. The number of arrangements of 6 pseudo-circles was found by Andrii Shportko and Jon Wild to be 17,552,169. - _Jon Wild_, Jun 03 2025
%C A250001 In A288559, a(5) included 26 non-circularizable pseudocircle arrangements, which generated in turn 132,546 6-pseudocircle descendants. These descendants must be excluded from A250001, which means that a tighter upper bound for A250001(6) is 17,419,623. - _Andrii Shportko_, Jun 06 2025

%e A250001 a(2) = 3, because two circles can either be next to each other, overlap with two intersection points, or one may be located within the other (of larger radius). (As per the first comment, the limiting case where they touch in one point is [somewhat arbitrarily] excluded. This would add two more independent configurations, where one touched the other "from inside" or "from outside".) - _M. F. Hasler_, May 03 2025
