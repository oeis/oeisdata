%N A307870 Numbers k with record values of the ratio d(k)/ud(k) between the number of divisors and the number of unitary divisors.
%C A307870 Numbers k with d(k)/2^omega(k) > d(j)/2^omega(j) for all j < k, where d(k) is the number of divisors of k (A000005), and omega(k) is the number of distinct prime factors of k (A001221), so 2^omega(k) is the number of unitary divisors of k (A034444).
%C A307870 Subsequence of A025487.
%C A307870 The first term that is divisible by the k-th prime is 4, 432, 2592000, 53343360000, 134190022982400000, 35377857659079936000000, 160601747163451186424832000000, 35800939973308629849857487360000000, ...
%C A307870 All the terms are powerful (A001694), since if p is a prime factor of k with multuplicity 1, then k and k/p have the same ratio.

%e A307870 All squarefree numbers k have d(k)/ud(k) = 1. Thus 4, the first nonsquarefree number, has a record value of d(4)/ud(4) = 3/2 and thus it is in the sequence.
