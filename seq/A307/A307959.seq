%N A307959 Primitive coreful perfect numbers: powerful numbers k such that csigma(k) = 2*k, where csigma(k) is the sum of the coreful divisors of k (A057723).
%C A307959 All the coreful perfect numbers (A307958) can be obtained from a primitive term k by multiplying it by m, if m is squarefree and coprime to k. The primitive terms are powerful. If k = m * r is in the sequence where r = rad(k) is the squarefree kernel of k (A007947), then the sum of the coreful divisors of k is csigma(k) = csigma(m * r) = sigma(m) * r, where sigma(m) is the sum of all the divisors of m (A000203). Thus k is a primitive coreful perfect number, iff sigma(m) * r = 2 * m * r, or m = k/rad(k) is a perfect number. Since k is powerful k = m * rad(m), thus all the primitive coreful perfect numbers can be generated from the perfect numbers by multiplying them by their squarefree kernel. The even terms of these sequence are (2^p) * (2^p-1)^2, were p is a Mersenne exponent (A000043). There is an odd term in this sequence iff there is an odd perfect number.
