%N A087651 Sequence of primorials P# (cf. A002110) such that j*P# has twin prime neighbors for some j with 0 < j < prime following P.
%C A087651 I think I have found a proof that the sequence is infinite.
%e A087651 I have found the first 122 values of this sequence, 121 and 122 are 2557#, 2557# with j=303 and j=2307, 1087 and 1088 digits.
%Y A087651 The j values are in A087730, P values are in A087731, i values are in A088676.
%Y A087651 Cf. A002110, A086916, A087732.
%Y A087651 Smaller of twin primes are in A087732. Number of digits in twin primes are in A086916.
