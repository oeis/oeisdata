%N A087416 Take unbounded lunar divisors of n as defined in A087029, add them using lunar addition. See A087083 for their conventional sum.
%C A087416 Two comments from _David Applegate_ on lunar perfect numbers, Nov 08 2003: (Start)
%C A087416 If we define a perfect number by "n is lunarly perfect if Sum_{d|n} d == 2*n (both sum and * lunar)", no such numbers exist because 9|n, so the lunar sum of divisors ends in 9, but 2*n ends in 2.
%C A087416 If we define a perfect number by "n is lunarly perfect if lunar Sum_{d|n, d != n} d == n", no such numbers exist. For suppose n is perfect. n != 9 (since 9 is 9's only divisor). Then 9|n and 9 != n, so Sum_{d|n, d!=n} d ends in 9 and thus so does n. But 9ish numbers are not divisible by any single digit < 9. Thus n has no divisors of the same length as n, other than n itself. So Sum_{d|n, d!=n} d is one digit shorter than n. (End)
