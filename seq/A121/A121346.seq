%N A121346 Conjectured lower bound for the number of spheres of radius 1 that can be packed in a sphere of radius n.
%C A121346 The formula was given by David W. Cantrell in a thread "Packing many equal small spheres into a larger sphere" in the newsgroup sci.math on May 29 2006.
%C A121346 Cantrell's formula can be expressed quite accurately using an easy-to-remember rule of thumb: a(n) = n^2*((3/4)*n - 1). To be even more precise, subtract 1%, i.e., multiply by a factor of 0.99. - _Hugo Pfoertner_, Jun 12 2025
