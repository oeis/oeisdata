%N A121385 Minimal number of monochromatic three-term arithmetic progressions that a two-coloring of {1,...,n} can contain.
%C A121385 a(9) = 1 is the well-known fact that the van der Waerden number for two colors and three-term arithmetic progressions is 9.
%C A121385 From _Rob Pratt_, May 27 2014: (Start)
%C A121385 By ignoring the last element, we see that a(n) >= a(n-1).
%C A121385 The general problem for k terms and r colors can be solved by using integer programming, with binary decision variables x[i,c] = 1 if element i receives color c and 0 otherwise, y[i,d] = 1 if arithmetic progression (i,i+d,...,i+(k-1)*d) is monochromatic and 0 otherwise. The constraints are Sum_{c=1..r} x[i,c] = 1 for all i in 1..n and Sum_{j=0..k-1} x[i+j*d,c] - k + 1 <= y[i,d] for all i, d, c. The objective is to minimize Sum_{i, d} y[i,d].
%C A121385 Upper bounds are a(46) <= 90, a(47) <= 95, a(48) <= 100, a(49) <= 104, a(50) <= 110. (End)
%e A121385 a(8) = 0 because we can two color {1,...,8} by 11001100 so that there are no monochromatic three-term arithmetic progressions.
