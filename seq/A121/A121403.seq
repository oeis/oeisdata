%N A121403 Decimal expansion of the area of home plate (USA major league baseball) in square inches.
%C A121403 The home plate in baseball is an irregular pentagon with edge lengths in inches (8.5, 17, 8.5, 12, 12), incorrectly shown in Kreutzer as having 3 right angles. The area of home plate in square inches is thus the area of the 8.5*17 rectangle plus the area of the (12,12,17) isosceles triangle. The latter is (17/2)*sqrt(12^2 - (17^2)/4) = (17/4)*sqrt(287), which is a near-integer, 71.999565, because the angle is so close to a right angle. Hence the home plate area is approximately 216.49956 square inches, which is coincidentally close to (6^3) + 1/2. [High-precision calculation by _T. D. Noe_ from the exact solution in this comment.]
