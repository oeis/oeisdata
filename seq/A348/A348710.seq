%N A348710 In the binary expansion of n, decrease the length of each run of 1-bits by one.
%C A348710 Equivalently, change bits 01 -> 0, including a 0 reckoned above the most significant 1-bit of n so change there.
%C A348710 A single 1-bit run decreases to nothing.  The Fibbinary numbers (A003714) are those n with only single 1-bits so that a(n) = 0 iff n is in A003714.
%C A348710 a(n) = 1 iff n is in A213540 since those values end with bits 011 (which become 01) and otherwise have only single 1-bits as per the Fibbinary numbers.
%C A348710 Decreasing each run is the inverse of the increase A175048 so that a(A175048(k)) = k.  This n = A175048(k) is the smallest n with a(n) = k and then other occurrences of k are by inserting single 1-bits into this n, including anywhere above the most significant bit.
