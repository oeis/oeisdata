%N A348612 Numbers k such that the k-th composition in standard order is not an anti-run, i.e., has adjacent equal parts.
%C A348612 First differs from A345168 in lacking 37, corresponding to the composition (3,2,1).
%C A348612 A composition of n is a finite sequence of positive integers summing to n. The k-th composition in standard order (row k of A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again.
