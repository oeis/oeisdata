%N A348738 Numbers k for which A326042(k) < k.
%C A348738 Claim: If there is an odd term y of A336702 larger than one, and it is the least one of such terms, then it should satisfy condition that for all nontrivial unitary divisor pairs d and x/d of x = A064989(y) [with gcd(d,x/d) = 1, 1 < d < x], the other divisor should reside in this sequence, and the other divisor in A348739. Proof: Applying A064989 to the odd terms of A336702 gives the fixed points of A326042. Suppose there are other odd terms in A336702 in addition to its initial 1, and let y be the least of these odd terms > 1 and x = A064989(y). Because A326042 (from here on indicated with f) is multiplicative, it follows that if we take any two nontrivial unitary divisors a and b of x, with x = a*b, gcd(a,b) = 1, 1 < a,b < x, then f(a)*f(b) = f(x) = x. Because f(x)/x = 1, we must have f(a)/a * f(b)/b = 1, as also the ratio f(n)/n is multiplicative. But f(a)/a and f(b)/b cannot be equal to 1, because then a and b would also be fixed by f, which contradicts our assumption that x were the least such fixed point larger than one. Therefore f(a) < a and f(b) > b, or vice versa. See also the comments in A348930, A348933.
%C A348738 Moreover, all odd perfect numbers (a subsequence of A336702), if such numbers exist, should also satisfy the same condition, regardless of whether they are the least of such numbers or not, because having a non-deficient proper divisor will push the abundancy index (ratio sigma(n)/n) of any number over 2. That is, for any such pair of nontrivial unitary divisors d and x/d, both A003961(d) and A003961(x/d) should be deficient, i.e., neither one should be in A337386. See also the condition given in A347383.
