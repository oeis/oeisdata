%N A343475 a(n) is the number of preference profiles for n men and n women, where men prefer distinct women as their first choice.
%C A343475 This sequence is the number of preference profiles for the Stable Marriage Problem such that the male-proposing Gale-Shapley algorithm terminates in one iteration.
%C A343475 This is the same number of preference profiles as when all men rank the different women at the i-th place, where i can be anywhere from 1 to n.
%C A343475 Note this is the same as the number of preference profiles for n men and n women where the women prefer distinct men as their first choice.

%F A343475 a(n) = n!^(n+1) * (n-1)!^n.
%e A343475 When n = 3, there are 3! = 6 ways to order the women as first preferences for the men, 2!^3 = 8 ways to finish the mens' profiles, and then 3!^3 = 216 ways to complete the womens' profiles, making a total of 6 * 8 * 216 = 10368 preference profiles.
