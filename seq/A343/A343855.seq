%N A343855 Numbers whose second digit is not zero and such that removing either the first or last digit leaves a square number.
%C A343855 The requirement that the second digit is not zero is so that both of the two squares have the same number of digits.
%C A343855 For k > 2, the number of k-digit terms is given by A344570(k-1).
%C A343855 All terms have last digit either 1, 4, 6, or 9. A term cannot have last digit 0 since that would mean one of the squares ends in an odd number of zeros and all squares end in an even number of zeros. A term cannot have last digit 5 since squares ending in 5 have 25 as last 2 digits and there are no squares having last digit 2. The last 2 digits of terms must be one of 01, 04, 09, 16, 41, 44, 49, 56, 61, 64, 69, 96. - _Chai Wah Wu_, May 27 2021

%e A343855 14 is a term because both 1 and 4 are square numbers.
%e A343855 164 is a term because both 16 = 4^2 and 64 = 8^2 are square numbers.
%e A343855 1441 is a term because both 144 = 12^2 and 441 = 21^2 are square numbers.
