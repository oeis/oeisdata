%N A343450 Integers whose nonincreasing digits are at most one more than their position.
%C A343450 Enumeration of the different triangulated planar polygons (TPP) on a base through hierarchic ear addition. An ear of a polygon is a triangle with two edges on the boundary. Start with a triangle on base 0, and number the two other edges 1 and 2 in counterclockwise direction. Add an ear on edge 1 or 2. The two different quadrilaterals on base 0 have now three other edges and we add a new ear on one of the renumbered edges 1, 2 or 3 but only where it forms a nonincreasing sequence with the preceding ear additions. We now have 1 and 2 for the two quadrilaterals and 11, 21, 22, 31, 32 for the five different pentagons. We can continue for the next polygons. Each generated number with v-3 digits stands for one triangulated planar polygon with v edges and vice versa and we don't have duplicates. However the decimal numbering limits the last generation to 98765432, for an 11-gon (4 <= v <= 11). The starting triangle (a degenerate TPP3) can also be seen as an ear addition on the base 0 (v >= 3).

%e A343450 '1' and '2' are the 2 triangulated planar polygons on 4 vertices (TPP4). '11, 21, 22, 31, 32' are the 5 TPP5. The next group with 3 digits gives the 14 TPP6, and so on, following the Catalan numbers 2, 5, 14, 42, ... (see A000108).
%e A343450 Additionally, the numbers of d-digit terms with the same starting digit reflect the numbers in the d-th row of Catalan's triangle, A009766 (e.g., 1 two-digit number starting with '1', 2 starting with '2' and 2 starting with '3').
%e A343450 The 1111...'s are fan-TPP's with the top in vertex 1 (between edge 0 and 1), and 98765432 is also, but with the top in the last vertex.
