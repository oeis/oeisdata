%N A343839 Semi-one numbers: Positive integers k such that exactly half of the integers 1..k have a 1 in their decimal expansion.
%C A343839 There are only these 16 semi-one numbers. That there can only be finitely many is fairly easy to show: consider how many 100-billion-digit numbers have no 1s in them. Eventually the proportion of 1-less numbers drops below 50% and stays there. 5217031 numbers up to 9999999 have a 1 in them so proportion of 1-ful numbers can't drop below 50% for numbers with more digits. Hence the search program can stop at 10 million.

%e A343839 16 is semi-1 because 1,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 have a 1 in them, there are 8 such numbers, and 8 is half of 16. 2 is semi-1 because 1 has a 1 in it and 2 does not.
