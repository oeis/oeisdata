%N A343015 Decimal expansion of the probability that at least 2 of 23 randomly selected people share a birthday, considering leap years.
%C A343015 The usual solution of the Birthday Problem, 1 - ((365!)/((365 - 23)! * 365^23)) = 0.507297... (A333507), is based on the assumption that all the years have 365 days.
%C A343015 The solution given by Nandor (2004) includes leap years, i.e., 97 years of 366 days in each cycle of 400 years of the Gregorian calendar.
%C A343015 With the addition of leap-year days, i.e., the possibility of having a birthday on February 29, the probability is reduced to 0.506876...
%C A343015 This constant is a rational number: its numerator and denominator have 111 and 112 digits, respectively.
%C A343015 The sequence has a period of 7.983424...*10^108.
