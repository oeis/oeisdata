%N A343699 a(n) is the number of preference profiles in the stable marriage problem with n men and n women with n - 1 pairs of soulmates (people who rank each other first).
%C A343699 Such profiles have exactly one stable matching, where soulmates are married to each other.
%C A343699 The men-proposing Gale-Shapley algorithm when used on these preference profiles will end in j rounds if the man in the non-soulmate pair ranks his partner as j-th. A similar statement is true for the women-proposing Gale-Shapley algorithm.

%F A343699 a(n) = (n - 1)!^(2n + 1) * n^2 * (n^2 - 1).
%e A343699 When n = 2, there are 2 ways to pick the man in the soulmate pair and 2 ways to pick the woman in the soulmate pair. After this, the soulmate's preference profiles are fixed. There are 4 ways to complete the profiles for the other two people, but 1 of the ways creates a second pair of soulmates, which is forbidden. Thus, there are 12 profiles with exactly one pair of soulmates.
