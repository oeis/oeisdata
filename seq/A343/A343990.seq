%N A343990 Number of grid-filling curves of order n (on the square grid) with turns by +-90 degrees generated by folding morphisms that are self-avoiding but not plane-filling.
%C A343990 Curves of order n generated by folding morphisms are walks on the square grid, also coded by sequences (starting with D) of n-1 U's and D's, the Up and Down folds. These are also known as n-folds. In the square grid they uniquely correspond to folding morphisms, which are a special class of morphisms sigma on the alphabet {a,b,c,d}. (There is in particular the requirement that the first two letters of sigma(a) are ab.) Here the letters a,b,c, and d correspond to the four possible steps of the walk.
%C A343990 A curve C = C1 of order n generates curves Cj of order n^j by the process of iterated folding. Iterated folding corresponds to iterates of the folding morphism. Grid-filling or plane-filling means that all the points in arbitrary large balls of gridpoints are eventually visited by the Cj.

%e A343990 Examples for n = 5 are given in Knuth's 2010 update. There are pictures which show (or suggest) that the 5-folds coded by DDUU, DUDD, DDUD are perfect, DUUD and DUDU yield a self-avoiding curve which is not plane-filling, and the other 3 give self-intersecting curves. So A343992(5) = 3 and a(5) = 2.
