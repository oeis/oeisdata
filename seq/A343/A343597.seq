%N A343597 Numbers divisible by a 7-smooth composite number.
%C A343597 Numbers divisible by at least one of 4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 25, 35, 49.
%C A343597 Exactly half of the first 10, first 100 and first 600 positive integers are divisible by a 7-smooth composite number; the largest 7-smooth divisor of the remaining numbers is 1, 2, 3, 5 or 7.
%C A343597 Intervals extending to hundreds of integers with exactly 50% membership of this sequence are far from rare, some notable examples being [3000, 3999], [8000, 8999], [20000, 20999], [21000, 21999] and [23000, 23999]. This reflects the asymptotic density of the corresponding set being close to 0.5, precisely 1847 / 3675 = 0.50258503... (and membership of the set has a periodic pattern). See A343598 for further information.

%F A343597 {a(n)} = {k : k >= 1, 2 <= A014673(k) <= 7}, where A014673(k) = lpf(k/lpf(k)), where lpf(m) = A020639(m), the least prime factor of m.
%F A343597 For n >= 1, a(22164 + n) = 44100 + a(n).
%F A343597 For n < 22164, a(22164 - n) = 44100 - a(n).
%e A343597 33 = 11 * 3 has divisors 1, 3, 11, 33, of which only 33 is composite. 33 is not 7-smooth, as its prime factors include 11, which is greater than 7. So 33 is not in the sequence.
%e A343597 52 = 13 * 2 * 2 is divisible by 4, which is composite and 7-smooth, so 52 is in the sequence.
