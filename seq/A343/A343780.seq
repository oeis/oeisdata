%N A343780 If n good guys followed by n bad guys stand in a circle, a(n) is the least q such that executing every q-th person gets all bad guys first.
%C A343780 There are 2n people in a circle, numbered 1 through 2n; the first n are "good guys" and the last n are "bad guys." We count, starting from 1, to the q-th person, who is executed; then, starting from the next position, repeat until all bad guys are gone.
%C A343780 This is a variant of the Josephus problem. In exercise 1.21 of Concrete Mathematics, it is proved there is always a q such that all bad guys are executed before any good guys, namely the least common multiple of n+1, n+2, ..., 2n (which provides an upper bound for a(n)).
%C A343780 According to Ball and Coxeter, in medieval times this was called the "Turks and Christians problem", described as n Turks and n Christians aboard a ship in a storm, which will sink unless half the passengers are thrown overboard; every q-th person will be tossed in the sea.
%C A343780 Schumer (2002) mentions this version along with more variants (e.g., eliminating all odd-numbered people first) in the section "Subsets marked for elimination".
%C A343780 Graham, Knuth and Patashnik say a non-rigorous argument suggests that a "random" value of q will succeed with probability (n/(2n)) * ((n-1)/(2n-1)) * ... * (1/(n+1)) = 1/binomial(2n,n) ~ sqrt(Pi*n)/4^n, so we might expect to find such a q less than 4^n (page 500). All the known values of a(n) are (much) less than 4^n.

%e A343780 For n = 2, we have four people; with q = 7 we count 1,2,3,4,1,2,3 and person 3 is eliminated. Next we count 4,1,2,4,1,2,4, so person 4 is eliminated, leaving only 1 and 2. Attempting this with any q < 7 does not eliminate 3 and 4 first.
