%N A246203 Permutation of natural numbers: a(n) = A246201(A193231(n)).
%C A246203 This permutation has the same cycle structure as A246163 has because this is its A193231-conjugate.
%C A246203 On the other hand, it shares with A246201 the following property:
%C A246203 Because 2 is the only even term in A014580, it implies that, apart from a(2)=7, odd numbers occur in odd positions only (along with many even numbers that also occur in odd positions).
%C A246203 Note that for any value k in A246156, "Odd reducible polynomials over GF(2)": 5, 9, 15, 17, 21, 23, ..., a(k) will be even, and apart from 2, all other even numbers are mapped to some even number, so all those terms reside in infinite cycles, and apart from 5 and 15, all of them reside in separate cycles. The infinite cycle containing 5 and 15 goes as: ..., 14523, 3889, 103, 59, 11, 13, 5, 2, 7, 15, 4, 6, 14, 12, 28, 58, 480, 3728, 3932416, ... and it is only because a(2) = 7, that it can temporarily switch back from even terms to odd terms, until right after a(15) = 4 it is finally doomed to the eternal evenness.
