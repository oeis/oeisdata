%N A231791 Integers k such that A231589(k) = floor(k*(k-1)/4) - k.
%C A231791 It appears that this sequence is the union of 3 sets.
%C A231791 First term is 8, and is the only even known value.
%C A231791 Then we get terms that are equal to 25 * b with b a squarefree product of primes congruent to 1 modulo 4 (A002144), that is, terms of A231754.
%C A231791 And we get the following terms 77, 133, 209, 301, 469, 473, 737, 817, 1141, 1273, 1793, 2881, 3097, 7009, 10921. These numbers are the products of 2 distinct primes from this list: 7, 11, 19, 43, 67, 163 (a subsequence of A003173).
