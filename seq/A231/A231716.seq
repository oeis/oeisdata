%N A231716 Numbers with restricted residue set factorial base representation: numbers n which can be formed as a sum n = du*u! + ... + d2*2! + d1*1!, where each di is in range 1..i and gcd(di,i+1)=1.
%C A231716 A001088(n+1) gives the number of terms x in sequence for which A084558(x)=n.
%C A231716 Because totatives (the reduced residue set) of each natural number k form a multiplicative group of integers modulo same k, it means that taking e.g. inverses of each digit modulo same k or multiplying them (again modulo k) by some member of that set keeps the set closed, and thus applying these operations to each digit modulo i+1 (2 for the least significant digit in factorial base, 3 for the next, and so on) yield only digits allowed in this sequence, and thus they induce various permutations of this sequence. These can be further "normalized" to be permutations of natural numbers with a suitable ranking function, which is to be submitted later.
