%N A231293 Numbers m such that, in the prime factorization of m, the product of the prime factors equals the sum of prime factors and exponents.
%C A231293 If m = p_1^c_1 * p_2^c_2 * p_3^c_3 * ... * p_k^c_k, where c's are positive integers and p's are distinct primes, then product{j=1 to k}[p_j] = sum{j=1 to k}[p_j+c_j].
%e A231293 50 = 2 * 5^2; the product of the prime factors is 2 * 5 = 10, the sum of the prime factors and exponents is 2 + 1 + 5 + 2 = 10, hence 50 is in the sequence.
%e A231293 112 = 2^4 * 7; the product of the prime factors is 2 * 7 = 14, the sum of the prime factors and exponents is 2 + 4 + 7 + 1 = 14, hence 112 is in the sequence.
%e A231293 14172488 = 2^3 * 11^6, product of prime factors is 2*11 = 22, sum of prime factors and exponents is 2 + 3 + 11 + 6 = 22, hence 14172488 is in the sequence.
