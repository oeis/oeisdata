%N A289619 Positions of ones in A289618.
%C A289619 Numbers n such that A289617(n) = A005187(A001222(n)) is equal to 1 + A046645(n). Whether a number is included depends only on its prime signature, thus whenever any n is present in the sequence, so is also A046523(n).

%e A289619 6 = 2^1 * 3^1, thus A001222(6) = 1+1 = 2, and A005187(2) = 3. On the other hand, A005187(1) = 1, and 1+1 = 2, which is one less than 3, thus 6 is included like all nonsquare semiprimes.
%e A289619 30 = 2^1 * 3^1 * 5^1, thus A001222(30) = 3, while A005187(3) = 4, thus 30 is included like all products of three distinct primes.
%e A289619 72 = 2^3 * 3^2, thus A001222(72) = 3+2 = 5, and A005187(5) = 8. On the other hand, A005187(3)+A005187(2) = 4+3 = 7, and 8 = 7+1, thus 72 is included in the sequence.
