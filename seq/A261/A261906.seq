%N A261906 Numbers that are the sum of two nonzero palindromes.
%C A261906 More than the usual number of terms are shown in order to distinguish this from A260255.
%e A261906 22 is a member because it is the sum of two palindromes, 11+11 (not because it is a palindrome in its own right).
%e A261906 111 is not the sum of two nonzero palindromes, so appears in A260255 but not here. See A213879 for further differences between the two sequences.
