%N A261237 Number of steps needed when starting from (3^(n+1))-1 and repeatedly applying the map that replaces k with k - (sum of digits in base-3 representation of k) to encounter the first number whose base-3 representation begins with a digit other than 2.
%C A261237 a(n) = How many numbers whose base-3 representation begins with digit "2" are encountered before (3^n)-1 is reached when starting from k = (3^(n+1))-1 and repeatedly applying the map that replaces k by k - (sum of digits in base-3 representation of k). Note that (3^n)-1 (in base-3: "222...", with digit "2" repeated n times) is not included in the count, although the starting point (3^(n+1))-1 is.
%e A261237 For n=0, we start from 3^(0+1) - 1 = 2 (also "2" in base-3), and subtract 2 to get 0, which doesn't begin with 2, thus a(0) = 1.
%e A261237 For n=1, we start from 3^(1+1) - 1 = 8 ("22" in base-3), and subtract 2*2 = 4 to get 4 ("11" in base-3) which doesn't begin with 2, thus a(1) = 1.
%e A261237 For n=2, we start from 3^(2+1) - 1 = 26 ("222" in base-3), and subtract first 6 to get 20 ("202" in base-3), from which we subtract 4, to get 16 ("121" in base-3), so in two steps we have reached the first such number that does not begin with "2" in base-3, thus a(2) = 2.
