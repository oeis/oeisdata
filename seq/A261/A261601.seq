%N A261601 The number of K-Knuth classes of initial tableaux on n letters.
%C A261601 K-Knuth equivalence on words is the K-theoretic analog for Knuth equivalence on words. Two words are said to be Knuth equivalent if one can be obtained from the other via a finite series of applications of the Knuth relations:
%C A261601 xzy ~ zxy, (x < y < z)
%C A261601 yxz ~ yzx, (x < y < z).
%C A261601 In the K-theoretic version, two words are said to be K-Knuth equivalent if one can be obtained from the other via a finite series of applications of the K-Knuth relations:
%C A261601 xzy ~ zxy, (x < y < z)
%C A261601 yxz ~ yzx, (x < y < z)
%C A261601 x ~ xx,
%C A261601 xyx ~ yxy.
%C A261601 In 2006, Buch et al. introduced a new combinatorial algorithm called Hecke insertion, which is a K-theoretic analog of the well-known Schensted algorithm for the insertion of a word into a semistandard Young tableau. The Hecke insertion algorithm results in a strictly increasing tableau. An important difference between Knuth equivalence and K-Knuth equivalence is that, while insertion equivalence via the Schensted algorithm (resp. the Hecke algorithm) implies Knuth equivalence (resp. K-Knuth equivalence), the converse holds for the standard version but not for the K-theoretic version. In other words, two words can be K-Knuth equivalent but insert into different tableaux via the Hecke insertion algorithm.

%e A261601 For n = 2, there are 3 K-Knuth classes, each with one tableau. The tableaux representing the classes are the minimal tableaux of partition shapes (2), (1,1), and (2,1).
%e A261601 (A minimal tableau is a tableau in which each box is filled with the smallest positive integer that will make the filling a valid strictly increasing tableau.)
