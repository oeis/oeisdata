%N A261953 Start with a single equilateral triangle for n=0; for the odd n-th generation add a triangle at each expandable side of the triangles of the (n-1)-th generation (this is the "side to side" version); for the even n-th generation use the "vertex to vertex" version; a(n) is the number of triangles added in the n-th generation.

%C A261953 From _Manfred Boergens_, Sep 21 2021: (Start)
%C A261953 For finite sets of random points in the real plane with exactly n nearest neighbors, a(n) for n >= 2 is a lower bound for the maximal number of points. Conjecturally, a(n) equals this number.
%C A261953 The randomness provides for pairwise different distances with probability = 1.
%C A261953 A point A is called a nearest neighbor if there is a point B with smaller distance to A than to any other point C.
%C A261953 In graph theory terms: Let G be a finite simple digraph; the vertices of G are arbitrary placed points in R^2 with pairwise different distances; the edges of G are arrows joining each point (tail end) to its nearest neighbor (head end). If G contains exactly n nearest neighbors and b(n) is the maximal number of points in any such graph then a(n) is the best lower bound known as yet for b(n).
%C A261953 a(n) for n >= 2 can be seen as an "inverse" to A347941.
%C A261953 a(n) is built by constructing G with m points and n nearest neighbors, m chosen as maximal as possible, then defining a(n)=m. The start is a(2)=9 and a(3)=12. We call the pairs (m,n)=(9,2) and (m,n)=(12,3) "anchor pairs" and proceed to bigger n by combining graphs with these anchor pairs to bigger graphs. So the next anchor pairs are (18,4), (21,5) and (27,6).
%C A261953 We conjecture that a(n) is optimal. This claim is true if the following assumptions hold:
%C A261953 - The anchor pairs (9,2) and (12,3) are optimal.
%C A261953 - All bigger anchor pairs (m,n) are constructed by combining copies of (9,2) if n is even and adding one (12,3) if n is odd.

%e A261953 If the graph G in the comment by Manfred Boergens has 5 nearest neighbors there are at most 21 vertices in G (conjectured; it is proved that there are G with 5 nearest neighbors and 21 vertices but it is not yet proved that 21 is the maximum). - _Manfred Boergens_, Sep 21 2021
