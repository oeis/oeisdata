%N A261367 Number of nodes at level n in Euclid-Mullin graph starting with 1.
%C A261367 The Euclid-Mullin graph encodes all instances of Euclid's proof of the infinitude of primes. This sequences gives the number of nodes appearing at each level in the graph, when starting the graph from 1.
%C A261367 a(13) is almost certainly 7950 but requires the factorization of a 253-digit number to confirm.
%H A261367 Andrew R. Booker and Sean A. Irvine, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.03039">The Euclid-Mullin Graph</a>, to appear (2015).
%e A261367 Level 0 contains the single node 1, so a(0)=1.
%e A261367 Level 1 contains the prime factors of 1+1, i.e., 2, so a(1)=2.
%e A261367 The first interesting level is Level 5, which has the factors of 1*2*3*7*43+1 which are 13 and 139, hence a(5)=2.
%e A261367 At higher levels there can be more than one path from a node back to the root.
%Y A261367 Cf. A000945, A000946.
