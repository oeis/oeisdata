%N A261878 Number of distinct fractional parts of the sums 1/j+...+1/k with 1 <= j <= k <= n, where the fractional part of x is given by x - floor(x).
%C A261878 Conjecture: (i) If 1/j+..+1/k and 1/s+...+1/t have the same fractional part with 0 < min{2,k} <= j <= k, 0 < min{2,t} <= s <= t and j <= s, but the ordered pairs (j,k) and (s,t) are different, then we have 1/j+...+1/k = 1+1/s+...+1/t; moreover, either (j,k) = (2,6) and (s,t) = (4,5), or (j,k) = (2,4) and (s,t) = (12,12), or (j,k) = (2,11) and (s,t) =(5,12), or (j,k) = (3,20) and (s,t) = (7,19).
%C A261878 (ii) Let a > b >= 0 and m > 0 be integers with gcd(a,b) = 1 < max{a,m}. Then the numbers sum_{i=j,...,k}1/(a*i-b)^m with 1 <= j <= k and (j > 1 if k > a-b = 1) have pairwise distinct fractional parts.
%C A261878 Clearly, part (i) of the conjecture implies that a(n) = n*(n-1)/2 - 3 for all n > 20.
%C A261878 See also A261993 for a similar conjecture involving primes.

%e A261878 a(3) = 4 since the four numbers 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/2+1/3 = 5/6 have pairise distinct fractional parts.
%e A261878 a(6) = 15 since 1/1 and those 1/j+..+1/k with 1 < j <= k <= 6 and (j,k) not equal to (2,6), have pairwise distinct fractional parts, but 1/2+1/3+1/4+1/5+1/6 = 29/20 and 1/4+1/5 = 9/20 have the same fractional part.
