%C A026490 From _Jean-Paul Allouche_ and _Michel Dekking_, Sep 08 2019: (Start)
%C A026490 This sequence is a morphic sequence, i.e., the letter to letter image of a fixed point of a morphism. The morphism is defined on a four-letter alphabet:
%C A026490     1 -> 322, 2 -> 1212, 3 -> 323232, 4 -> 412.
%C A026490 The letter-to-letter map is given by 1 -> 1, 2 -> 2, 3 -> 3, 4 -> 1. The fixed point is the fixed point with prefix 4.
%C A026490 How is this obtained? Note that A026465 only has runs of the forms 2, 11 and 222. A026465 itself is the fixed point of the morphism alpha: 1 -> 121, 2 -> 12221.
%C A026490 The images of the runs under alpha are alpha(2) = 12221, alpha(11) = 121121, alpha(222) = 122211222112221. Coding the runs with their lengths this induces a morphism on the coded runs: 1 -> 32,  2 -> 1212, 3 -> 323232.
%C A026490 Here we use the fact that all three alpha-images have 1 as a prefix and as a suffix. This yields the 2 (coding of 11) at the end of the three images 32, 1212, 323232. The letter 4 is then added to deal with the somewhat strange fact that a(1)=1, a(2)=1. Strange, because the word 11 occurs nowhere else in (a(n)).
%C A026490 Actually, one can show in a similar way, using the square of the morphism 1 -> 2, 2 -> 211 instead of the morphism alpha, that (a(n+1)) = 1,2,3,2,1,2,...
%C A026490 is a purely morphic sequence, fixed point of the morphism 1 -> 123, 2 -> 212, 3 -> 1232323.
%C A026490 One sees from this (by projecting 1, 3 -> 1, 2 -> 2) that (a(n)) has the property a(2n+1) = 2 for all n > 1. Also, by removing the 2's, one sees that the sequence of 1's and 3's is the fixed point of the morphism 1 -> 131, 3 -> 13331, which is the sequence A080426.
