%N A197635 Wieferich-non-Wilson primes: non-Wilson primes that divide their Fermat-Wilson quotient A197633.
%C A197635 A Wieferich prime base a is a prime p satisfying a^(p-1) == 1 (mod p^2). A non-Wilson prime p is called a Wieferich-non-Wilson prime if p is a Wieferich prime base w_p, where w_p = ((p-1)!+1)/p is the Wilson quotient of p.
%C A197635 Michael Mossinghoff has computed that if a 4th Wieferich-non-Wilson prime exists, it is > 10^7.

%F A197635 A197634(A197637(a(n))) = 0.
%F A197635 (((p-1)!+1)/p)^(p-1) == 1 (mod p^2), where p = a(n).
%e A197635 The first two non-Wilson primes are 2 and 3, whose Fermat-Wilson quotients are 0. Since 2 and 3 divide 0, they are members.
%e A197635 The 1728th non-Wilson prime is prime(1731) = 14771, and A197634(1728) = 0, so 14771 is a member.
