%N A197547 Rank of quartic elliptic curve y^2 = 5*x^4 - 4*n.
%C A197547 According Magma ranks for n={33,67,97} are only lower bounds (maybe accurate but can be higher).
%C A197547 If a(n)=0 that means that the number of rational points on curve y^2=4*x^4-4*n is finite; if a(n)>0, the number of rational points is infinite. The value of the rank tells how many points of infinite order is necessary to generate complete infinite set of rational points of given curve.
%C A197547 The quintic trinomial of the form x^5+n*x+m has only finite many rational solutions with different Elkies coefficient n^5/m^4 if and only a(n)= 0; if a(n)>0, then there are infinitely many solutions.
