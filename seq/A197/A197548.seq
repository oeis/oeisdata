%N A197548 Rank of quartic elliptic curve y^2 = 5*x^4 + 4*n.
%C A197548 If a(n)=0, it means that the number of rational points on curve y^2=5*x^4+4*n is finite; if a(n)>0, the number of rational points is infinite. The value of the rank tells how many points of infinite order is necessary to generate complete infinite set of rational points of given curve.
%C A197548 The quintic trinomial of the form x^5-n*x+m has only finitely many cases such that is factorizable on quadratic and cubic factor with different Elkies coefficient n^5/m^4 if and only a(n)=0; if a(n)>0, then there are infinitely many solutions.
