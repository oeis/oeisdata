%C A128467 Possible lower bounds of twin primes pairs ending in 1.
%C A128467 For a 30k+r "wheel", r = 11, 17, 29 are the only possible values that can form a lower twin prime pair. The 30k + r wheel gives the recurrence 1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 49, 53, 59, ... which is frequently used in prime number sieves to skip multiples of 2, 3, 5. The fact that adding 2 to 30k + 1, 7, 13, 19, 23 will give us a multiple of 3 or 5 precludes these numbers from being a lower member of a twin prime pair. This leaves us with r = 11, 17, 29 as the only possible cases to form a lower bound of a twin prime pair.
