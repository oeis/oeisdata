%N A128284 Numbers of the form m = p1 * p2 * p3 where for each d|m we have (d+m/d)/2 prime and p1 < p2 < p3 each prime.
%C A128284 The symmetric representation of sigma (cf. A237593), SRS(a(n)), of any number in this sequence has between 4 and 8 regions with 3 regions impossible because p1 < p2 < p3 implies 2*p3 < p1*p2. When there are 8 regions they all have width 1 and their areas are the prime numbers (d+a(n)/d)/2 for the 4 respective pairs of divisors of a(n). In general, the areas of the regions in SRS(a(n)) need not be prime, except for the two symmetric outer regions (n+1)/2. - _Hartmut F. W. Hoft_, Jan 09 2021

%e A128284 165=3*5*11 and (3*5*11+1)/2=83, (3+5*7)/2=19, (5+3*7)/2=13, (7+3*5)/2=11 are all primes, so 165 is a term.
%e A128284 From _Hartmut F. W. Hoft_, Jan 09 2021: (Start)
%e A128284 a(1) = 105 = 3*5*7 and SRS(a(1)) consists of four regions with areas ( 53, 43, 43, 53 ); the center areas have maximum width 2 and represent the sum of primes (3+35)/2 + (5+21)/2 + (7+15)/2 = 43.
%e A128284 a(17) = 2373 = 3*7*17 is the first number in the sequence whose symmetric representation of sigma consists of 8 regions, all of width 1 and the respective symmetric regions have areas:  (2373 + 1)/2 = 1187, (791 + 3)/2 = 397, (339 + 7)/2 = 173, (21 + 113)/2 = 67. (End)
