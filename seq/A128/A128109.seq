%N A128109 Smallest positive real Gaussian prime having a gap size of exactly A128106(n).
%C A128109 These Gaussian primes have the form p+0*i, where p is an ordinary (rational) prime with p=3 (mod 4). Gethner et al. consider gaps around real Gaussian primes. In general, the Gaussian primes whose real and imaginary parts are given in A128107 and A128108 have a smaller magnitude than the real Gaussian primes given here. However, these real Gaussian primes are easier to compute.
