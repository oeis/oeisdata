%N A225949 Triangle for sum of the two legs (catheti) of primitive Pythagorean triangles.
%C A225949 For primitive Pythagorean triples (x,y,z) see the Niven et al. reference, Theorem 5.5, p. 232, and the Hardy-Wright reference, Theorem 225, p. 190.
%C A225949 Here a(n,m) = 0 for non-primitive Pythagorean triangles.
%C A225949 There is a one-to-one correspondence between the values n and m of this number triangle for which a(n,m) does not vanish and primitive solutions of x^2 + y^2 = z^2 with y even, namely x = n^2 - m^2, y = 2*n*m and z = n^2 + m^2. The mirror triangles with x even are not considered here. Therefore a(n,m) = n^2 - m^2 + 2*n*m (for these solutions).
%C A225949 The number of non-vanishing entries in row n is A055034(n).
%C A225949 The sequence of the main diagonal is 2*n^2-1 = A056220(n), n>= 2.
%C A225949 The sequence of the main diagonal is j^2 + k^2 - 2 or 2*j*k if n>=2 and j = n + sqrt(2)/2 and k = n - sqrt(2)/2. - _Avi Friedlich_, Mar 30 2015
%C A225949 If the 0 entries are eliminated and the numbers are ordered increasingly (keeping multiple entries) the sequence becomes A198441(n-1), n>=2. If multiple entries are recorded only once this becomes A058529 (a proper subsequence of A118905). Note that all leg sums <= N are certainly reached if one considers rows n = 2, ..., floor(-1 + sqrt(N+2)).
%C A225949 a(n, m) also gives twice the member t(n, m) of the triple (r(n, m), s(n, m), t(n, m)) with squares r(n, m)^2, s(n, m)^2 and t(n, m)^2 in arithmetic progression with common difference A(n, m) = A249869(n, m), the area of the primitive Pythagorean triangle, or 0 if there is no such triangle. The other members are given by 2*r(n, m) = A278717(n, m) and 2*s(n, m) = A222946(n, m). See A278717 for details and the Keith Conrad reference. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Nov 30 2016

%F A225949 a(n,m) = (n+m)^2 - 2*m^2 if n > m >= 1, gcd(n,m) = 1, and n and m are integers of opposite parity (i.e., (-1)^(n+m) = -1); otherwise a(n,m) = 0.

%e A225949 The primitive triangle for (n,m) = (2,1) is (x,y,z) = (3,4,5), with a(2,1) = 3 + 4 = 7.
%e A225949 The primitive triangle for (n,m) = (7,4) is (x,y,z) = (33,56,65), with a(7,4) = 33 + 56 = 89.
%e A225949 The primitive triangle for (n,m) = (8,1) is (x,y,z) = (63,16,65), with a(8,1) = 63 + 16 = 79.
%e A225949 All primitive Pythagorean triangles with leg sums <= 167 are certainly covered by this triangle (rows n = 2..12), and the multiplicities are also correct, e.g., 119 appears twice.
