%N A225387 Construct sequences P,Q,R by the rules: Q = first differences of P, R = second differences of P, P starts with 1,3,9, Q starts with 2,6, R starts with 4; at each stage the smallest number not yet present in P,Q,R is appended to R. Sequence gives R.
%C A225387 In contrast to A225376-A225378, here it is not required (and not true) that each number should appear just once in P union Q union R. On the other hand, again in contrast to A225376-A225378, here it is obvious that P, Q, R are infinite.
%C A225387 The first three numbers that are repeated are 284, 2074, 3500, which appear in both P and Q. There may be no others. Of course R is disjoint from P and Q, by definition.
