%N A227116 Given an equilateral triangular grid with side n, containing n(n+1)/2 points, a(n) is the minimal number of points to be removed from the grid, so that, if 3 of the remaining points are chosen, they do not form an equilateral triangle with sides parallel to the grid.
%C A227116 This is the complementary problem to A227308.
%C A227116 Numbers found by an exhaustive computational search for all solutions (see history).
