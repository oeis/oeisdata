%N A227923 Number of ways to write n = x + y (x, y > 0) such that 6*x-1 is a Sophie Germain prime and {6*y-1, 6*y+1} is a twin prime pair.
%C A227923 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 1. Moreover, any integer n > 4 not equal to 13 can be written as x + y with x and y distinct and greater than one such that 6*x-1 is a Sophie Germain prime and {6*y-1, 6*y+1} is a twin prime pair.
%C A227923 (ii) Any integer n > 1 can be written as x + y (x, y > 0) such that 6*x-1 is a Sophie Germain prime, and {6*y+1, 6*y+5} is a cousin prime pair (or {6*y-1, 6*y+5} is a sexy prime pair).
%C A227923 Part (i) of the conjecture implies that there are infinitely many Sophie Germain primes, and also infinitely many twin prime pairs. For example, if all twin primes does not exceed an integer N > 2, and (N+1)!/6 = x + y with 6*x-1 a Sophie Germain prime and {6*y-1, 6*y+1} a twin prime pair, then (N+1)! = (6*x-1) + (6*y+1) with 1 < 6*y+1 < N+1, hence we get a contradiction since (N+1)! - k is composite for every k = 2..N.
%C A227923 We have verified that a(n) > 0 for all n = 2..10^8.
%C A227923 Conjecture verified up to 10^9. - _Mauro Fiorentini_, Jul 07 2023

%e A227923 a(5) = 2 since 5 = 2 + 3 = 4 + 1, and 6*2-1 = 11 and 6*4-1 = 23 are Sophie Germain primes, and {6*3-1, 6*3+1} = {17, 19} and {6*1-1, 6*1+1} = {5,7} are twin prime pairs.
%e A227923 a(28) = 1 since 28 = 5 + 23 with 6*5-1 = 29 a Sophie Germain prime and {6*23-1, 6*23+1} = {137, 139} a twin prime pair.
