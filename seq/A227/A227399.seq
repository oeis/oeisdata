%N A227399 Number of permutations i_1, ..., i_n of 1, ..., n with i_1 = 1 and i_n = n such that i_1+2*i_2, i_2+2*i_3, ..., i_{n-1}+2*i_n, i_n+2*i_1 are pairwise distinct modulo n.
%C A227399 If n is not divisible by 3 then a(n) > 0 since the identical permutation of 1 ,..., n works for the purpose. If n is even, then a(n) > 0 since the permutation 1, 2, n-1, 4, n-3, 6, n-5, ..., n-2, 3, n meets the requirement. We guess that a(n) > 0 in the remaining case n = 6q+3 with q > 0. If n = 2k+1 == 3 (mod 6) with n > 3, then, for the permutation (i_1,...,i_n) = (1,2k,k,2k-1,k-1,2k-2,...,3,k+2,2,k+1,2k+1), all the n sums i_1+2*i_2, i_2+2*i_3, ..., i_{n-1}+2*i_n, i_n+2*i_1 are pairwise distinct (but they are not pairwise incongruent modulo n = 2k+1 when n > 9).
%C A227399 Zhi-Wei Sun also made the following general conjecture:
%C A227399 (i) (Weak version) Let a_1,...,a_n be n distinct elements of an additive abelian group G. Then, there is a permutation b_1,...,b_n of a_1,...,a_n such that a_1+2*b_1, a_2+2*b_2, ..., a_n+2*b_n are pairwise distinct. (The author has proved this for n up to 4 in any abelian group G.)
%C A227399 (ii) (Strong version) Let A be any subset of an additive abelian group G with |A| = n > 4. Then there is a numbering a_1, ..., a_n of all the elements of A  such that a_1+2*a_2, a_2+2*a_3, ..., a_{n-1}+2*a_n, a_n+2*a_1 are pairwise distinct. (The author has proved this for any torsion-free abelian group G.)
%C A227399 Recall that a conjecture of Snevily proved by Arsovski states that for any two n-subsets A and B of an additive abelian group of odd order there is a numbering a_1,...,a_n of all the elements of A and a numbering b_1, ..., b_n of all the elements of B such that the n sums a_1+b_1, ..., a_n+b_n are pairwise distinct.
