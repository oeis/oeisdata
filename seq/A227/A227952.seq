%N A227952 Wow! Signal intensity signature (6EQUJ5).
%C A227952 The "Wow! Signal" is a strong narrow-band signal detected by the SETI project in 1977. Several plausible explanations exist, but none have been affirmed beyond speculation. Some speculate that it could be an artificially generated signal of extra-stellar origins. The integer sequence describes the relative intensity of the signal sampled over a period of 72 seconds, specifically the signal-to-noise ratio. In the original chart on which it was first noticed, it was written in a base-36 alphabet as 6EQUJ5.
