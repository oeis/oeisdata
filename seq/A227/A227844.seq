%N A227844 Lexicographically earliest sequence whose second differences are the digits of Pi.
%C A227844 If the digits of Pi were random, and the digits of A226930 were also random, this sequence would have the same rate of growth as A226930. This is certainly not true for the initial terms. Here are histograms of the first 20000 digits of Pi and the second differences of A226930:
%C A227844 # of       0s    1s    2s    3s    4s    5s    6s    7s    8s    9s
%C A227844 Pi:      [1954, 1997, 1986, 1987, 2043, 2082, 2017, 1953, 1961, 2020]
%C A227844 A226930: [1766, 2859, 2066, 2082, 1991, 1911, 1937, 1847, 1795, 1746] (Note the excessive fraction of 1s)
%C A227844 So although both sequences appear to grow like C*n*(n+1)/2, the growth of A226930 is initially rather slower than that of A227844.
%C A227844 For large n it seems likely that A226930(n)/A227844(n) will approach 1.
