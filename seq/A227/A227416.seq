%N A227416 Magic numbers from Smale's 7th problem.
%C A227416 See pp. 16-17 of Nerattini et al. The sequence is defined as the numbers n of points distributed on the two-sphere in such a way that their average logarithmic pair-energy is minimal, and locally convex as a function of n. So far the available data for this sequence are empirical and should eventually be vindicated, or replaced if necessary, by rigorous data. The name "magic numbers" alludes to a similarity with the "magic numbers" in nuclear physics, see A018226.
