%N A233742 One sixth of gap g between 3 consecutive primes for the smallest k such that 6^n+k, 6^n+k+g, 6^n+k+2*g are consecutive primes in arithmetic progression.
%C A233742 g is a multiple of 6 as otherwise 6^n+k, 6^n+k+g, or 6^n+k+2*g is divisible by 2 or 3.
%C A233742 Sequence starts at n=2 as no solution for n=1.
