%N A233793 Least odd prime p such that 2*n - p = sigma(k) for some k > 0, or 0 if such an odd prime p does not exist, where sigma(k) is the sum of all (positive) divisors of k.
%C A233793 Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n > 1. Moreover, if n > 180 is not among 284, 293, 371, 542, 788, 1274, then 2*n can be written as p + sigma(m^2), where p is an odd prime and m is a positive integer.
%C A233793 See also part (i) of the conjecture in A233654.
%C A233793 Note that if sigma(k) is odd, then the order of k at each odd prime must be even, and hence k has the form m^2 or 2*m^2, where m is a positive integer.
%C A233793 We have verified part (i) of the conjecture for n up to 10^9.
