%N A233232 Primes p such that a Heronian triangle with a fixed side length of 5 contains p as another side length.
%C A233232 The triangle inequality requires that any integer triangle with a fixed side length of 5 can have remaining side lengths of (x, x+1),...,(x, x+4). The constraint that primitive Heronian triangles have only one even side will just permit (x, x+1) and (x, x+3). Also there is only one solution for the triple (5, x, x+3) namely (5, 5, 8).  So a(n) = x or x+1 whenever the Heronian triangle has x or x+1 as a prime and n is the ordered occurrence of this prime. The ordered sequence of x is given by A233231 where x(n) = 10x(n-3)-x(n-6)+4, x(0)=2, x(1)=3, x(2)=5, x(3)=12, x(4)=29, x(5)=51 starting at x(1).
%F A233232 Primes of the form x(m) or x(m)+1 where x(m) is given by x(m) = 10x(m-3)-x(m-6)+4, x(0)=2, x(1)=3, x(2)=5, x(3)=12, x(4)=29, x(5)=51 starting at x(1).
%e A233232 a(4)=29 because the triangle with sides (5, 29, 30) is Heronian, 29 is prime and is the 4th occurrence of such a prime.
