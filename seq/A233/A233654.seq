%N A233654 |{prime p < n: n - p = sigma(k) for some k > 0}|, where sigma(k) is the sum of all (positive) divisors of k.
%C A233654 Conjecture: (i) Let n > 1 be an integer. Then we have a(2*n) > 0. Also, 2*n + 1 can be written as p + sigma(k), where p is a Sophie Germain prime and k is a positive integer.
%C A233654 (ii) Each odd number greater than one can be written as sigma(k^2) + phi(m), where k and m are positive integers, and phi(.) is Euler's totient function.
%C A233654 That a(2*n+1) > 0 for n > 1 is a consequence of Goldbach's conjecture, for, if 2*n = p + q with p and q both prime, then 2*n + 1 = p + sigma(q) = q + sigma(p).
