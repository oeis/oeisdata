%N A233435 Primes p in prime triples (p, p+4, p+6) at the end of the maximal gaps in A201596.
%C A233435 Prime triples (p, p+4, p+6) are one of the two types of densest permissible constellations of 3 primes. Maximal gaps between triples of this type are listed in A201596; see more comments there.

%e A233435 The gap of 6 between triples starting at p=7 and p=13 is the very first gap, so a(1)=13. The gap of 24 between triples starting at p=13 and p=37 is a maximal (record) gap - larger than any preceding gap; therefore a(2)=37. The gap of 30 between triples at p=37 and p=67 is again a record, so a(3)=67. The next gap is smaller, so a new term is not added to the sequence.
