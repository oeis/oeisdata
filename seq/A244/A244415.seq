%N A244415 Exponent of 4 appearing in the 4-adic value of 1/n, n >= 1, given in A240226(n).
%C A244415 See the comment under A240226 for g-adic value of x and the Mahler reference, p. 7, where this exponent is called f.
%C A244415 Note that the exponent used in the g-adic value of 1/n is also called g-adic valuation of n if g is prime. See e.g., A007814 (g=2) and A007949 (g=3) and the corresponding A006519 and A038500 for the 2-adic and 3-adic value of 1/n, respectively.

%F A244415 a(n) = 0 if n is odd, and if n is even a(n) = f(1/n) with f(1/n) the smallest positive integer such that the highest power of 2 in n (that is A006519(n)) divides 4^f(1/n).

%e A244415 n = 2: A006519(2) = 1, 2 divides 4^1, hence f(1/2) = 1 = a(2).
