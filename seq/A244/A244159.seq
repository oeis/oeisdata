%N A244159 Semigreedy Catalan Representation of nonnegative integers.
%C A244159 Algorithm for constructing the sequence: Define a(0) as 0, and for larger values of n, find first the largest Catalan number which is less than or equal to n [which is A081290(n)], and the index k = A244160(n), of that Catalan number. Initialize a vector of k zeros, [0, 0,  ..., 0]. Set n_remaining = n - A000108(k) and add 1 to the leftmost element of vector, so that it will become [1, 0, ..., 0]. Then check whether the previous Catalan number, C(m) = A000108(m), where m = k-1, exceeds the n_remaining, and provided that C(m) <= n_remaining, then set n_remaining = n_remaining - C(m) and increment by one the m-th element of the vector (where the 1st element is the rightmost), otherwise just decrement m by one and keep on doing the same with lesser and lesser Catalan numbers, and whenever it is possible to subtract them from n_remaining (without going less than zero), do so and increment the corresponding m-th element of the vector, as long as either n_remaining becomes zero, or after subtracting C(1) = 1 from n_remaining, it still has not reached zero. In the latter case, find again the largest Catalan number which is less than or equal to n_remaining, and start the process again. However, after a finite number of such iterations, n_remaining will finally reach zero, and the result of a(n) is then the vector of numbers constructed, concatenated together and represented as a decimal number.
%C A244159 This shares with "Greedy Catalan Base" (A014418) the property that a simple weighted sum of Sum_{k=1..} digit(k)*C(k) recovers the natural number n, which the given numeral string like A014418(n) or here, a(n), represents. (Here C(k) = the k-th Catalan number, A000108(k), and digit(1) = the digit in the rightmost, least significant digit position.)
%C A244159 In this case, A244158(a(n)) = n holds for only up to 33603, after which comes the first representation containing a "digit" larger than nine, at a(33604), where the underlying string of numbers is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] but the decimal system used here can no more unambiguously represent them.
%C A244159 On the other hand, with the given Scheme-functions, we always get n back with: (CatBaseSumVec (A244159raw n)).
%C A244159 For n >= 1, A014138(n) gives the positions of repunits: 1, 11, 111, 1111, ...
%C A244159 The "rep-2's": 22222, 222222, 2222222, 22222222, 222222222, ..., etc., occur in positions 128, 392, 1250, 4110, 13834, ... i.e. 2*A014138(n) for n >= 5.

%F A244159 If A176137(n) = 1, a(n) = A007088(A244230(n)), otherwise a(n) = A007088(A244230(n)-1) + a(n-A197433(A244230(n)-1)).
%F A244159 For all n, a(A197433(n)) = A007088(n).
%F A244159 For all n >= 1, a(A000108(n)) = 10^(n-1).
%F A244159 Each a(A014143(n)) has a "triangular" representation [1, 2, 3, ..., n, n+1].
%e A244159 For n = 18, the largest Catalan number <= 18 is C(4) = 14.
%e A244159 Thus we initialize a vector of four zeros [0, 0, 0, 0] and increment the first element to 1: [1, 0, 0, 0] and subtract 14 from 18 to get the remainder 4.
%e A244159 We see that the next smaller Catalan number, C(3) = 5 is greater than 4, so we cannot subtract it without going negative, so the second leftmost element of the vector stays as zero.
%e A244159 We next check C(2) = 2, which is less than 4, thus we increment the zero at that point to 1, and subtract 4 - 2 to get 2.
%e A244159 We compare 2 to C(1) = 1, and as 1 <= 2, it is subtracted 2-1 = 1, and the corresponding element in the vector incremented, thus after the first round, the vector is now [1, 0, 1, 1], and n remaining is 1.
%e A244159 So we start the second round because n has not yet reached the zero, and look for the largest Catalan number <= 1, which in this case is C(1) = 1, so we subtract it from remaining n, and increment the element in the position 1, after which n has reached zero, and the vector is now [1, 0, 1, 2], whose concatenation as decimal numbers thus yields a(18) = 1012.
