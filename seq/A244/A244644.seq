%N A244644 Consider the method used by Archimedes to determine the value of Pi (A000796). This sequence denotes the number of iterations of his algorithm which would result in a difference of less than 1/10^n from that of Pi.
%C A244644 It takes on average 5/3 iterations to yield another digit in the decimal expansion of Pi.
%C A244644 The side of a 96-gon inscribed in a unit circle is equal to sqrt(2-sqrt(2+sqrt(2+sqrt(2+sqrt(3))))). This is the size of one of the two polygons that Archimedes used to derive that 3 + 10/70 < Pi < 3 + 10/71.
%C A244644 In the Mathematica program, we started with an inscribed triangle and a circumscribed triangle of a unit circle and used decimal precision to just over a 1000 places.
%C A244644 The perimeter of the circumscribed 3*2^n-polygon exceeds Pi by more than the deficit of the perimeter of the inscribed 3*2^n-polygon. If we were to give twice the weight of the inscribed 3*2^n-polygon to that of the circumscribed 3*2^n-polygon, then the convergence would be twice as fast!
%C A244644 From _A.H.M. Smeets_, Jul 12 2018: (Start)
%C A244644 Archimedes's scheme: set upp(0) = 2*sqrt(3), low(0) = 3 (hexagons); upp(n+1) = 2*upp(n)*low(n)/(upp(n)+low(n)) (harmonic mean, i.e., 1/upp(n+1) = (1/upp(n) + 1/low(n))/2), low(n+1) = sqrt(upp(n+1)*low(n)) (geometric mean, i.e., log(low(n+1)) = (log(upp(n+1)) + log(low(n)))/2), for n >= 0. Invariant: low(n) < Pi < upp(n); variant function: upp(n)-low(n) tends to zero for n -> inf. The error of low(n) and upp(n) decreases by a factor of approximately 4 each iteration, i.e., approximately 2 bits are gained by each iteration.
%C A244644 From Archimedes's scheme, set r(n) = (2*low(n) + upp(n))/3, r(n) > Pi and the error decreases by a factor of approximately 16 for each iteration, i.e., approximately 4 bits are gained by each iteration. This is often called "Snellius acceleration".
%C A244644 For similar schemes see also A014549 (in this case with quadratically convergence), A093954, A129187, A129200, A188615, A195621, A202541.
%C A244644 Note that replacing "5/3" by "log(10)/log(4)" would be better in the first comment. (End)

%F A244644 Conjecture: There exists a c such that a(n) = floor(n*log(10)/log(4)+c); where c is in the range [0.08554,0.10264]. Critical values to narrow the range are believed to be at a(74), a(133), a(192), a(251), a(310), a(366), a(425), a(484). - _A.H.M. Smeets_, Jul 23 2018
%e A244644 Just averaging the initial two triangles (3.89711) would yield Pi to one place of accuracy, i.e., the single digit '3'. Therefore a(0) = 0.
%e A244644 The first iteration yields, as the perimeters of the two hexagons, 4*sqrt(3) and 6. Their average is ~ 3.2320508 which is within 1/10 of the true value of Pi. Therefore a(1) = 1.
%e A244644 a(3) = 5 since it takes 5 iterations of Archimedes's algorithm to drive the averaged value of the circumscribed 96-gon and the inscribed 96-gon to yield a value within 0.001 of the correct value of Pi.
%e A244644 a(4) = 6 since it takes 6 iterations of Archimedes's algorithm to drive the averaged value of the circumscribed 3*2^6-gon and the inscribed 3*2^6-gon to yield a value within 0.0001 of the correct value of Pi.
