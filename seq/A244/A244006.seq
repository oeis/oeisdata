%N A244006 Triangle read by rows, q-multinomial coefficient generalization of 3-dimensional lattice paths from the origin to (m,m,m).
%C A244006 The sum of the elements in the m-th row gives the total number of lattice paths from the origin to (m,m,m), and the number of elements in the m-th row is 3*m^2+1. The (m,n)-th entry gives the number of lattice paths from the origin to (m,m,m) with inversion number n. The inversion number of a given lattice path depends on the ordering of the coordinates, but the total number of lattice paths with inversion number n does not. To calculate the inversion number w.r.t. an ordering of coordinates, fix such an ordered set of coordinates (x_1, x_2, x_3) and represent a lattice path, L, as a sequence, S(L), of m copies of each of the numbers {1,2,3} in the natural way (a step in the x_1 direction corresponds to a 1, a step in the x_2 direction corresponds to a 2, etc.).
%C A244006 (1) There is a natural way to associate each sequence, S(L), to a set of two partitions, P_1 and P_2, where P_1 fits in an box of size m X m and P_2 fits in a box of size m X 2*m. The inversion number of L is given by |P_1|+|P_2|. See link.
%C A244006 (2) Equivalently, the inversion number of L is given by summing over each entry in S(L), the number of entries which precede that entry and whose value exceeds that entry's.
%C A244006 The sequence is palindromic and unimodal by row.
