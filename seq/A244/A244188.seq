%N A244188 Numbers n such that the digit that repeats the most at the end of n^k for some k is not the last digit of n.
%C A244188 a(n) ends in either a 2, 3, or 7.
%C A244188 If a(n) ends in a 2, the digit that repeats itself the most at the end of a(n)^k is 8.
%C A244188 If a(n) ends in a 3, the digit that repeats itself the most at the end of a(n)^k is 7.
%C A244188 If a(n) ends in a 7, the digit that repeats itself the most at the end of a(n)^k is 3.
%C A244188 The numbers that end in 2 are congruent to {2, 12, 22, 42} mod 50.
%C A244188 The numbers that end in 3 are congruent to {33, 73, 113, 153} mod 200.
%C A244188 The numbers that end in 7 are congruent to {37, 77, 117, 197} mod 200.
%e A244188 2^k ends in 2 of the same digit for k = 18 mod 20 (last digit is 4) and 19 mod 20 (last digit is 8). 2^k ends in 3 of the same digit for k = 39 mod 100 (last digit is 8). Since 8 is the only possibility, 8 must remain the only possibility for any larger run of identical digits. Since 8 is not the last digit of 2, then 2 is a member of this sequence.
%e A244188 33^k ends in 2 of the same digit for k = 1 mod 20 (last digit is 3) and 7 mod 20 (last digit is 7). 33^k ends in 3 of the same digit for k = 87 mod 100 (last digit is 7). Since 7 is the only possibility, 7 must remain the only possibility for any larger run of identical digits. Since 7 is not the last digit of 33, 33 is a member of this sequence.
