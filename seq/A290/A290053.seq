%N A290053 Triangle read by rows: Polynomial coefficients per comment.
%C A290053 Let phi_(D,rho) be the average value of a generic degree D monic polynomial f when evaluated at the roots of the rho-th derivative of f, expressed as a polynomial in the averaged symmetric polynomials in the roots of f. [See arXiv:1706.08381 [math,GM], 2017.] The "last" term of phi_(D,rho) is a multiple of the product of all roots of f; the coefficient is expressible as a polynomial h_D(N) in N:=D-rho. These polynomials are of the form h_D(N) = ((-1)^D/(D-1)!)(D-N)N^chi*g_D(N) where chi = (1 if D is odd, 0 if D is even) and g_D(N) is a monic polynomial of degree (D-2-chi). Then a(n) are the coefficients of the polynomials N^chi*g_D(N), starting at D=2. The leading term of each row is 1 (polynomials are monic). The final terms in all even rows are 0. In each row, terms alternate in sign.

%H A290053 Gregory Gerard Wojnar, <a href="/A290053/a290053.java.txt">java_program</a> which (1) creates Maple program to create polynomial referenced in Comment, and (2) creates list of polynomial portion's coefficients (without trailing 0 constant term is odd degree cases) which constitute the rows of this triangle. Each run of the program is for a single degree; to change the degree the user must modify the value of "level" in line 393 of the java code.
