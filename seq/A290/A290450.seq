%N A290450 Primes with property that the next prime has the same last digit.
%C A290450 Starts off the same as A031928, primes p such that the next prime is p + 10. First term that differs is 887, since 897 = 3 * 13 * 23 and the next prime is 907.
%C A290450 As the primes get larger and more sparsely distributed, the difference between successive primes is less likely to be less than 10.
%C A290450 One might expect that a prime is 1/4 as likely to be followed by a prime with the same least significant digit in base 10 (since the possibilities are 1, 3, 7, 9).
%C A290450 One might also expect this sequence to consist of a quarter of the primes. And yet pi(a(50)) = pi(3547) = 497; the 200th prime is 1223.

%e A290450 139 is in the sequence because the immediately following prime is 149, which also ends in 9.
%e A290450 But 149 is not in the sequence because the next prime after that one is 151, which ends in 1, not 9.
