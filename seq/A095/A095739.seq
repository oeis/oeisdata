%N A095739 Numbers known to be solitary but not coprime to sigma.
%C A095739 Abundancy is defined as the ratio of the multiplicative sum-of-divisors function to the integer itself: abund(n) = sigma(n)/n. E.g., abund(10) = sigma(10)/10 = (1+2+5+10)/10 = 1.8 = 9/5.
%C A095739 Integers m and n are friendly iff they have the same abundancy. E.g., abund(12) = abund(234) = 7/3 ===> 12 and 234 are friends.
%C A095739 Integers which have no friends are called solitary.
%C A095739 "It is believed that 10, 14, 15, 20, 22, 26, 33, 34, 38, 44, 46, 51, 54, 58, 62, 68, 69, 70, 72, 74, 76, 82, 86, 87, 88, 90, 91, 92, 94, 95, 99, 104, 105, 106 and many others are also solitary, although a proof appears to be extremely difficult."
