%N A095732 Sum of A095734(p) for all primes p such that Fib(n+1) <= p < Fib(n+2) (where Fib = A000045).

%e A095732 a(1) = a(2) = 0, as there are no primes in ranges [1,2[ and [2,3[. a(3)=1 as in [3,5[ there is prime 3 with Fibonacci-representation 100, which is just a one fibit-flip away from being a palindrome (i.e. A095734(3)=1). a(4)=3, as in [5,8[ there are primes 5 and 7, whose Fibonacci-representations are 1000 and 1010 respectively and the other needs one bit-flip and the other two to become palindromes and 1 + 2 = 3. a(5)=1, as in [8,13[ there is only one prime 11, with Zeckendorf-representation 10100, which needs to have just its least significant fibit flipped from 0 to 1 to become palindrome.
