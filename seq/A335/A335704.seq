%N A335704 Erroneous version of A113653.
%C A335704 This is the erroneous version of A113653 that was submitted to the OEIS by _Jonathan Vos Post_ on Jan 16 2006. Because 44 was omitted from the spiral, not only are the terms here incorrect, but a large number of other sequences will also need to be corrected. For this reason the whole of the original submission has been preserved here with a different A-number. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jun 27 2020
%C A335704 Isolated semiprimes in the hexagonal spiral, embedded in the triangular lattice, are the analogy to A113688 "Isolated semiprimes in the [square] spiral," as well as analogous in another way to the hexagonal prime spiral of [Abbott 2005; Weisstein, "Prime Spiral", MathWorld]. A113519 Semiprimes in first spoke of a hexagonal spiral (A056105). A113524 Semiprimes in second spoke of a hexagonal spiral (A056106). A113525 Semiprimes in third spoke of a hexagonal spiral (A056107). A113527 Semiprimes in fourth spoke of a hexagonal spiral (A056108). A113528 Semiprimes in fifth spoke of a hexagonal spiral (A056109). A113530 Semiprimes in sixth spoke of a hexagonal spiral (A003215). This is embedded in the hexagonal spiral of A003215 and A001399, which is centered on zero; of course such a spiral can be constructed beginning with any integer. Centering on zero gives the interesting partition and multigraph equalities of A001399.

%F A335704 {a(n)} = {integers in A001358 which are not adjacent in any of six directions to any other integers in A001358 when arranged as the hexagonal spiral of A003215}.
%e A335704 Copy this as proportionally spaced text, make semiprimes bold, draw boundaries around clumps of adjacent semiprimes. For example, there is a triangular clump of three semiprimes: {4, 14, 15}; a linear clump of three semiprimes {49, 77, 111}; a linear clump of two semiprimes {247, 305}; an irregular clump of seven {115, 155, 201, 202, 203, 253, 254}; a clump of eighteen whose least element is 33 and greatest is 206; and a long branching clump of sixteen whose least element is 9 and greatest is 129.
