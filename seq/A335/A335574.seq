%N A335574 Numbers of the form 16n^2 + 32n + 15 for which the central region of its symmetric representation of sigma consists of two subparts of sizes 4n+7 and 4n+1, n>=0.
%C A335574 The sequence is a subsequence of A141759.  An alternate description is that for any divisor d <= row(a(k)) - see A235791 - of a(k) = (4n+3)(4n+5) the inequalities d != 4n+3, d != 4n+5 and 2d < 4n+3 hold in addition to 2*(4n+3) > row(a(k)). These conditions state that the symmetric representation of sigma consists of an odd number of regions and that the central region has maximum width 2. With the triangular function T in A235791 we get T[a(k), 4n+3] = T[(4n+3)(4n+5), 4n+3 ] = 2n + 4 and T[a(k), 4n+5] = T[(4n+3)(4n+5), 4n+5 ] = 2n + 1 determining the lengths of the two subparts - see A279387 - as 2*(2n+4) - 1 = 4n + 7 and 2*(2n+1) - 1 = 4n + 1 which results in the pattern [ 3 width 1, (4n + 1) width 2,  3 width 1 ] of unit cells and a total area of 8*(n+1) for the central region. The first region has area 8*(n+1)^2.
%F A335574 a(k) = (4n+3)(4n+5) for n = sqrt(a(k)+1)/4 - 1, i.e., a(k) = A141759(n), for k>=0.
%e A335574 a(3) = 255 = 3*5*17 = 15*17 = A141759(3) is in the sequence since 2*3 < 15 and 2*5 < 15 with row(255) = 22, and the central region of its symmetric representation of sigma has maximum width 2 and area 32 with subparts 4*3+7 = 19 and 4*3+1= 13.
%e A335574 3173 = 3*5*11*19 = 55*57 = A141759(13) is the first number in A141759 not in this sequence since the central region of the symmetric representation of sigma for 3173 has width 3 and also 2*(3*11) = 66 > 55.
%e A335574 a(37) = 32399 = 179*181 = A141759(44)  is in the sequence since the divisor conditions are vacuously true and the central region of its symmetric representation of sigma has maximum width 2 and area 8*45 = 360 with subparts 4*44 + 7 = 183 and 4*44 + 1 = 177.
%e A335574 35343 = 3*3*3*7*11*17 = (11*17)*(7*27) = 187*189 = A141759(46) is not in the sequence since 2*99, 2*119 and 2*153 exceed 187. While the area of the first region of its symmetric representation of sigma is 8*47^2 = 17672, the area of the central region is 21992 and of maximum width 5.
