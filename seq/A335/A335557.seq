%N A335557 Primitive abundant numbers version 2 (abundant numbers all of whose proper divisors are deficient numbers) and increasing any prime factor in the prime factorization gives a non-abundant number when factored back.
%e A335557 104 is in the sequence as none of its divisors is abundant and its prime factorization, 2^3 * 13 has the property that when any prime factor is increased to the next prime factor, we get 3^3 * 13 = 351 which isn't abundant (it's then deficient as it's not perfect) or we get 2^3*17 = 136 which is deficient.
