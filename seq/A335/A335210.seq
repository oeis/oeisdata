%N A335210 Numbers L such that there is a prime p <= L for which v_p(H'(L) - 1) > 0, where v_p(x) is the p-adic valuation of x and H'(L) is the L-th alternating harmonic number.
%C A335210 This sequence was inspired by the database of Krattenthaler and Rivoal (see the link below) about all triplets of numbers (L, p, v_p(H(L) - 1)) such that 1 <= L <= 10^6, p prime <= L, and v_p(H(L) - 1) > 0. Here v_p(x) is the p-adic valuation of x and H(L) is the L-th harmonic number. See also the sequences A268112, A335189, and A335207.
%C A335210 Here we tabulate the numbers L >= 1 for which there is a prime p <= L such that v_p(H'(L) - 1) >= 1, where H'(L) = Sum_{k=1..L} (-1)^(k+1)/k. The first few numbers L for which v_p(H'(L) - 1) = 2 (rather than 1) for some p <= L are 1501, 4596, and 9367 with corresponding p equal to 7, 19, and 37, respectively.
