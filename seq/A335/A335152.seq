%N A335152 Number of vertices in polytope representing the number n.
%C A335152 More than the usual number of terms are shown here in order to distinguish this sequence from A064047. The two sequences first differ at n=128.
%C A335152 Comments from _Ya-Ping Lu_, May 25 2020 (Start):
%C A335152 Concerning the sequences A064047 and the number of vertices of the polytope representing n (the present sequence). These two sequences are similar but not exactly the same.
%C A335152 As you can see from the pdf file attached, for n<=127, A064047 is the same as N_vert. For n > =128, A064047 is always greater than or equal to N_vert. This is due to the fact that in some cases not all the non-vertex numbers on the polytope can be written as the geometric mean of two integers on the polytope. See also A334810 and A334897.
%C A335152 The cases where A064047 is greater than N_vert are highlighted in yellow in the attached file. (End)
