%N A125680 Blue moon years > 2000 (new definition), listed with multiplicity, i.e., once for each month having two full moons.
%C A125680 A blue moon is the second full moon to occur in a single calendar month. The sequence contains the (Gregorian) years during which each succeeding blue moon will occur.
%C A125680 This is a new version of the definition. The original definition is that of the third full moon in a season which has four. All of the definitions depend on the longitude of the observer. Unless specified otherwise, we should assume that we refer to UTC. A special subsequence is that of the years (1999, 2018, 2037, ...) in which there is no full moon in February, which usually implies that there are two in January as well as in March. This happens most often at an interval of 19 years, but sometimes also 8 or 11 years, for example in 1589, 1608, 1627, 1646, 1665, 1676, 1684, 1695, 1714, 1741, 1752, 1760, 1771, 1790, 1798, 1809, 1828, 1847, 1866... - _M.
