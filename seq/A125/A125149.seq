%N A125149 a(n) is the least k such that the n-almost prime count is positive and equal to the (n-1)-almost prime count. a(0) = 1.
%C A125149 Unlike any of the prime number races in which any particular form may lead or trail, this sequence demonstrates that although the count of numbers having k prime factors begins by trailing the count for k-1 prime factors, eventually they exchange positions in the race. This can be seen by looking at A126279 or A126280.
%C A125149 The fundamental theorem of arithmetic, or unique factorization theorem, states that every natural number greater than 1 either is itself a prime number, or can be written as a unique product of prime numbers. It had a proof sketched by Euclid, then corrected and completed in "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae" [Carl Friedrich Gauss, 1801]. It fails in many rings of algebraic integers [Ernst Kummer, 1843], a discovery initiating algebraic number theory. Counting the elements in the unique product of prime numbers classifies natural numbers into primes, semiprimes, 3-almost primes and so on. This sequence quantifies a previously undescribed structure to that classification.
%C A125149 We took the first k where the two relevant counts are the same. If instead we took the least k such that the n-almost prime count from k onwards exceeds the (n-1)-almost prime count, the sequence would begin: 3, 34, 15530, ... [see A180126].
%C A125149 The prime count and the semiprime count are identical for 1, 10, 15, 16, 22, 25, 29, 30, 33.
%C A125149 The semiprime count and the 3-almost prime count are identical for 1, 2, 3, 15495, 15496, 15497, 15498, 15508, 15524, 15525, 15529.
%C A125149 The numbers of 3-almost primes and 4-almost primes are equal at 151165506066 and 731 larger numbers, the last one being 151165607041. See A180126. - _T. D. Noe_, Aug 11 2010

%e A125149 a(1) = 2 since 1 has no prime factors and 2 has one prime factor, therefore prime factor counts of 0 and 1 occur equally often in the first 2 integers.
%e A125149 a(2) = 10 since there are 4 primes {2, 3, 5 & 7} and 4 semiprimes {4, 6, 9 & 10} less than or equal to 10.
%e A125149 a(4) = 151165506066 since there are 32437255807 4-almost primes and 3-almost primes <= a(4).
