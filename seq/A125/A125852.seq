%N A125852 Number of points in a hexagonal lattice covered by a circular disk of diameter n if the center of the circle is chosen such that the disk covers the maximum possible number of lattice points.
%C A125852 a(n)>=max(A053416(n),A053479(n),A053417(n)). a(n) is an upper bound for the number of segments of a self avoiding path on the 2-dimensional triangular lattice such that the path fits into a circle of diameter n. A122226(n)<=a(n).
