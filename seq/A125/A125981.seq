%N A125981 Signature-permutation of Deutsch's 2000 bijection on ordered trees.
%C A125981 Deutsch shows in his 2000 paper that this automorphism converts any ordered tree with the number of nodes having degree q to a tree with an equal number of odd-level nodes having degree q-1, from which it follows that, for each positive integer q, the parameters "number of nodes of degree q" and "number of odd-level nodes of degree q-1" are equidistributed. He also shows that this automorphism converts any tree with k leaves to a tree with k even-level nodes, i.e., in OEIS terms, A057514(n) = A126305(A125981(n)).
%C A125981 To obtain the signature permutation, we apply the given Scheme-function *A125981 to the parenthesizations as encoded and ordered by A014486/A063171 (and surrounded by extra pair of parentheses to make a valid Scheme-list) and for each n, we record the position of the resulting parenthesization (after discarding the outermost parentheses from the Scheme-list) in A014486/A063171 and this value will be a(n).

%o A125981 (Scheme) ;; Implementation of this automorphism that acts on S-expressions; i.e., list-structures:
%o A125981 (define (*A125981 s) (cond ((null? s) s) (else (append (*A125981 (car s)) (list (map *A125981 (cdr s)))))))
%Y A125981 Inverse: A125982. The number of cycles, maximum cycle sizes and LCM's of all cycle sizes in range [A014137(n-1)..A014138(n-1)] of this permutation seem to be given by A089411, A086586 and A089412, thus this is probably a conjugate of A074683/A074684. A125983 gives the A057163-conjugate.
