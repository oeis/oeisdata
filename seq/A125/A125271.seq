%N A125271 Number of Gaussian integer divisors of n (having positive real part).
%C A125271 To avoid the redundancy of counting the negatives of the divisors, we consider only divisors having a positive real part.
%C A125271 The usual method of counting complex divisors is to exclude associates. For example, although 1+i and 1-i both divide 2, one is just -i times the other. This sequence counts each first-quadrant complex divisor twice. Sequence A062327 counts those complex divisors only once. - _T. D. Noe_, Feb 21 2007

%F A125271 a(n) = 2*A062327(n) - A000005(n). - _T. D. Noe_, Feb 21 2007
%e A125271 a(5) = 6 because 5 is divisible by the Gaussian integers {1, 1-2i, 1+2i, 2-i, 2+i, 5}, which is 6 divisors in all.
