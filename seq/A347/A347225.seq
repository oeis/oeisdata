%N A347225 Lesser of twin primes (A001359) being both half-period primes (A097443).
%C A347225 A proper subset of both A001359 and A097443.
%C A347225 Number of terms < 10^k: 0, 0, 3, 19, 86, 516, 3686, 27834, 216758, 1739358, ...
%C A347225 A243096 provides lesser of twin primes being both full reptend primes (A001913, A006883): in other words, lesser of twin primes whose periods difference is 2.
%C A347225 This sequence lists lesser of twin primes whose periods difference is 1. Equivalently, these twin primes are both half-period primes (A097443).
%C A347225 The twin primes conjecture being true should imply that these two sequences are infinite.
%C A347225 Surprisingly, apart from 1 and 2, for any other value of k integer, it appears that the sequence "lesser of twin primes whose periods difference is k" is empty or contains at most two terms (no counterexample found for twin primes below 10^9).
%F A347225 a(n) is congruent to {11, 17, 29} mod 30.
%e A347225 The decimal expansion 1/p for the prime p = 1277 has a periodic part length equal to (p-1)/2. 1277 is thus a half-period prime. The same applies for p + 2 = 1279 (prime). Hence 1277 is in sequence.
%p A347225 select(t -> isprime(t) and isprime(t + 2) and numtheory:-order(10, t) = (t - 1)/2 and numtheory:-order(10, t + 2) = (t + 1)/2, [seq(t, t = 3 .. 40000, 2)]);
