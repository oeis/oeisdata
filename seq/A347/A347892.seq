%N A347892 Nonsquarefree numbers k such that A003968(k) is a multiple of k, where A003968 is multiplicative with a(p^e) = p*(p+1)^(e-1).
%C A347892 All terms k are multiples of 36 and A056170(k) = 2. Proof: Imagine k had a non-unitary prime divisor p^e, with p > 3 and e > 1. Then p^e divides A003968(k) only if k has also another non-unitary prime divisor q^h (with h > 1), such that p divides (q+1), which implies that q > p. But then q^h divides A003968(k) only if there is yet another non-unitary prime divisor r^i, such that r > q (and i > 1), and so on, which is clearly impossible by reductio ad infinitum. Therefore we should consider only the cases p=2 and p=3, because they are only primes that can occur as non-unitary prime factors in k, and at least either of them must occur with exponent larger than one, because every k is nonsquarefree. Let e = A007814(k) and h = A007949(k), so that 2^e and 3^h are the highest powers of 2 and 3 that divide k. Because A003968 changes "extra" 2's to 3's and extra 3's to 4's, it must follow that e >= h > e/2. Therefore, if e >= 2 (k is a multiple of 4), h must be at least 2. On the other hand, if h >= 2, then e also must be at least 2. In other words, if k is a multiple of 4, it must then also be a multiple of 9, and vice versa, thus k is a multiple of 36 and k has exactly two non-unitary prime divisors (2^e and 3^h, with e, h > 1), therefore this is a subsequence of A338539.
