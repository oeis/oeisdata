%N A347139 Continued fraction expansion of the elementary charge in natural units.
%C A347139 Elementary charge e (A081823) in units of the rationalized Planck charge sqrt(epsilon * h-bar * c), where epsilon = vacuum permittivity (A081799), h-bar = reduced Planck constant (A254181), c = speed of light (A003678).
%C A347139 Similarly, the fine-structure constant (A082726) is the square of the elementary charge in units of the non-rationalized Planck charge sqrt(h-bar * c / k_e) where k_e = 1/(4*Pi*epsilon) is the Coulomb constant. As a result, they are related by e = sqrt(4*Pi*alpha).
%C A347139 Alpha and e are energy-dependent (as described by a beta function). The value given here corresponds to the zero-energy limit.
