%N A347860 Irregular triangle T(n,k) where row n is the partition of n with the least number of 3-smooth parts such that the product of parts is minimal.
%C A347860 Let k = 2^a * 3^b be a part such that n is the sum of at least one such k. Then we may represent k at (a,b) on a Cartesian grid. In Dimitrov, et al., these k are known as "digits" in a 2-dimensional number base system. Since these partitions have the least number of parts (digits) in order to represent n, in Dimitrov this is called a "canonic form" for n in base (2,3).
%C A347860 These numbers represent an extreme representation where the digits tend to be spread farthest apart in the plot described above.
%C A347860 Additionally, this canonic representation of n is often identical to the greedy representation of n shown by row n in A276380.
