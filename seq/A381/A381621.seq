%N A381621 Sorted list of sums of 4 prices in minor currency units for a currency that has a 2-decimal minor unit, such that the riddle "sum of prices equals product of prices" has a solution, with prices expressed as floating point numbers with 2 decimals.
%C A381621 The sequence is finite, but the number of terms is currently unknown.
%C A381621 A natural number s occurs k times in the list if there exist k multisets {a,b,c,d} of natural numbers with s = a + b + c + d and 100^3*s = a*b*c*d.

%e A381621 a(1) = 644 = A380887(4) because 1.25 + 1.60 + 1.75 + 1.84 = 1.25*1.60*1.75*1.84 = 6.44 is the solution with minimum sum;
%e A381621 a(7) = a(8) = 675 because there are 2 solutions:
%e A381621   1.00 + 1.50 + 2.00 + 2.25 = 1.00*1.50*2.00*2.25 = 6.75 and
%e A381621   1.20 + 1.25 + 1.80 + 2.50 = 1.20*1.25*1.80*2.50 = 6.75;
%e A381621 a(22) = 711 corresponds to the solution of the puzzle "The 7-Eleven" quoted from "The Guardian" in A380887.
