%N A359799 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest positive number which has not appeared that shares a factor with |a(n-1) - a(n-2)| while the difference |a(n) - a(n-1)| is distinct from all previous differences |a(i) - a(i-1)|, i=2..n-1.
%C A359799 In the first 100000 terms the only fixed point is a(1) = 1; it is unknown if more exist. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.
%H A359799 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A359799/a359799.png">Image for n = 1..100000</a>. The green line is a(n) = n.
%e A359799 a(5) = 2 as |a(4) - a(3)| = |12 - 6| = 6, and 2 is the smallest unused number that shares a factor with 6 while the difference |2 - a(4)| = |2 - 12| = 10 is distinct from all previous differences.
