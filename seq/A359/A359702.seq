%N A359702 Odd primes p that are not congruent to 2*k modulo prime(k+1) for any positive integer k.
%C A359702 This sequence arises from a more general study. First, consider a function f : P -> N (where P is the set of the odd prime numbers) such that 0 <= f(p) < p. Then, remove from the set P each prime number q such that q = f(p) (mod p) for some p.
%C A359702 For example, if f(p) = 0 for each p, then the final set is the empty set.
%C A359702 If f(p) = 1 for each p, then the final set seems to be the set of Fermat primes (empirical observation).
%C A359702 If f(p) = p-1, then the final set seems to be the set of Mersenne primes (empirical observation).
%C A359702 For the particular choice f(p) = 2k (where p is the k-th odd prime) this sequence is obtained.

%e A359702 Terms in this sequence are those odd primes that are neither congruent to 2 (mod 3), nor congruent to 4 (mod 5), nor congruent to 6 (mod 7), nor congruent to 8 (mod 11), etc.
%e A359702 7 is a term because 7 == 1 (mod 3) and 7 == 2 (mod 5).
%e A359702 11 is not a term because 11 == 2 (mod 3).
%e A359702 13 is not a term because 13 == 6 (mod 7).
%e A359702 17 is not a term because 17 == 2 (mod 3).
%e A359702 19 is not a term because 19 == 8 (mod 11).
