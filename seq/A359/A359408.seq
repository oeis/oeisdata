%N A359408 Integers d such that the largest possible arithmetic progression (AP) of primes with common difference d has only two elements.
%C A359408 These 2 elements are not necessarily consecutive primes.
%C A359408 There are only these two possibilities (see examples):
%C A359408 1. If d is a positive term of A040976, then d = prime(n) - 2 and, for each such d, there exist only one largest AP of primes, and this AP is always: (2, prime(n)) = (2, d+2), so starts with 2.
%C A359408 2. If d is an even term, then the largest corresponding APs are of the form (q, q+d) with q odd primes.
%C A359408 A342309(d) gives the first element of the smallest AP with 2 elements whose common difference is a(n) = d.

%F A359408 m is a term iff A123556(m) = 2.
%e A359408 d = 1 is a term because the only largest AP of primes with common difference 1 is (2, 3) that has 2 elements.
%e A359408 d = 3 is a term because the only largest AP of primes with common difference 3 is (2, 5) that has 2 elements.
%e A359408 d = 5 is a term because the only largest AP of primes with common difference 5 is (2, 7) that has 2 elements.
%e A359408 d = 16 is a term because the first largest APs of primes with common difference 16 are (3, 19), (7,23), (13, 29), ... and all have 2 elements; the first one that starts with A342309(16) = 3 is (3, 19).
%e A359408 d = 22 is a term because the first largest APs of primes with common difference 22 are (7, 29), (19, 41), (31, 53), ... that all have 2 elements; the first one that starts with A342309(22) = 7 is (7, 29).
