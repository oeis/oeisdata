%N A359935 Irregular table read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of k-gons, k>=2, among all distinct circles that can be constructed from an n x n square grid of points using only a compass.
%C A359935 A circle is constructed for every pair of the n x n points, the first point defines the circle's center while the second the radius distance. The number of distinct circles constructed from the n x n points is A359931(n).
%C A359935 See A359932 and A359933 for images of the circles.
%C A359935 The first occurrence of a 2-gon is when n = 7. Assuming the grid points are separated by 1 unit, in the first quadrant this region has endpoints (6,7) and (7,6) - an equivalent region is in each of the three other quadrants. Its arcs are from two circles, one with center at (2,2) going through point (-2,-3) while the other has center (3,3) going through point (0,-1). See the attached image.
%H A359935 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A359935/a359935.jpg">Close-up of the circles for n = 7</a>. The 2-gon is the thin region shown in white in the upper-right corner.
%F A359935 Sum of row n = A359933(n).
