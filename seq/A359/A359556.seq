%e A359556 a(4) = 1 because 18, the average of the 4th twin prime pair (17, 19), can be expressed in one way only as the arithmetic mean of the averages of two other twin prime pairs. These are (5, 7) and (29, 31) with their averages 6 and 30: (6 + 30)/2 = 36/2 = 18.
%e A359556 a(7) = 2 because 60, the average of the 7th twin prime pair (59, 61), can be expressed in two ways as the arithmetic mean of the averages of two other twin prime pairs. Firstly, by the averages 12 and 108 of the twin prime pairs (11, 13) and (107, 109), since (12 + 108)/2 = 120/2 = 60. Secondly, by the averages 18 and 102 of the twin prime pairs (17, 19) and (101, 103), as (18 + 102)/2 = 120/2 = 60 also.
%e A359556 a(15) = 0 because 198, the average of the 15th twin prime pair (197, 199), cannot be expressed as the arithmetic mean of the averages of any other two twin prime pairs.
