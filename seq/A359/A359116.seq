%N A359116 Mark the points of the Farey series F_n on a strip of paper and wrap it around a circle of circumference 1 so the endpoints 0 and 1 coincide; draw a chord between every pair of the Farey points; a(n) is the number of vertices in the resulting graph.
%C A359116 Let F_n denote the Farey series of order n: F_1 = [0, 1]; F_2 = [0, 1/2, 1]; F_3 = [0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 1], F_4 = [0, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 1], etc. In general F_n consists of the points i/j with 1 <= j <= n, 0 <= i <= j, gcd(i,j) = 1, sorted and duplicates removed. Alternatively, F_n = [A006842(n,k)/A006843(n,k), k = 1..A005728(n)].
%C A359116 The number of terms in F_n is A005728(n). Since the endpoints coincide when we wrap the series around the circle, there are M = A005728(n) - 1 vertices on the circumference.
%C A359116 The planar graph we are studying, denoted by FR(n), is formed by drawing a chord between every pair of the M boundary points.  FR stands for Farey Ring, a term suggested by the fairy rings found in nature.
%C A359116 FR(n) is analogous to the planar graph formed by drawing chords between every pair of vertices of a regular n-gon, and studied in A006533 and A007678. The difference is that in FR(n) the vertices are not equally spaced around the circle.
%C A359116 Just as in the case of the regular n-gon, when we count the regions in this graph, we may or may not include the regions that lie between the convex hull of the points and the bounding circle.
%C A359116 The first non-simple vertices that do not lie on the y = 0 or x = 0 axes occur for n = 7. If we let A = (sin(3*Pi/14) + cos(Pi/7))/(cos(3*Pi/14) + sin(Pi/7)), and B = (cos(2*Pi/7)+1)/sin(2*Pi/7), then the x coordinate of these vertices is x = +-(A*cos(3*Pi/14) - sin(3*Pi/14) - 1)/(B + A), and their y coordinate is y = -B*x - 1. These values are approximately x = +-0.1930964297 and y = -0.5990311320.
