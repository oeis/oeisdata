%N A359751 Numbers m > 1 such that for all k > 1, m can be written as a product of factorials without using k!.
%C A359751 The name makes this different from "Numbers that are a product of factorials" (A001013). For example, numbers that can be written as a product of factorials > 1 in exactly one way are excluded as it is impossible to write such a product without using any of the factorials in this factorization. See the exclusion of 12 in the example section.
%C A359751 This is a primitive sequence related to A359750. A359750(n) = a(k) * A001013(m) for at least one pair (k, m).

%e A359751 2880 is in the sequence via 2880 = (2!)^2 * 6! = 4!*5! = (2!)^2 * 3! * 5!. The factorials > 1 that are factors in a least one of these products are 2!, 3!, 4!, 5!, 6!. None of these factorials occur as factors in all of these products. For example, 2! no factor in 4!*5!, 3! no factor in 4!*5!, 4! no factor in (2!)^2 * 6!, 5! no factor in (2!)^2 * 6!, 6! no factor in 4!*5!.
%e A359751 24 is in the sequence (even though it is a factorial number) as 24 = 2! * 2! * 3! = 4!. So 24 can be written as a product of factorials in at least two ways (some of the factorials {2!, 3!, 4!}). But none of these factorials is in every factorization.
%e A359751 48 is NOT in the sequence as 48 = 2! * 2! * 2! * 3! = 2! * 4!. So 48 can be written as a product of factorials in at least two ways (some of the factorials {2!, 3!, 4!}). But 2! is a factor of every factorization.
%e A359751 12 is NOT in the sequence even though it can be written as a product of factorials, namely 2! * 3! = 12. As this is the only way to write 12 as a product of factorials, it is impossible to write 12 as a product of factorials without using 2!.
