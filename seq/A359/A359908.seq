%N A359908 Numbers whose prime indices have integer median.
%C A359908 A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798.
%C A359908 The median of a multiset is either the middle part (for odd length), or the average of the two middle parts (for even length).
%e A359908 The prime indices of 180 are {1,1,2,2,3}, with median 2, so 180 is in the sequence.
%e A359908 The prime indices of 360 are {1,1,1,2,2,3}, with median 3/2, so 360 is not in the sequence.
%t A359908 prix[n_]:=If[n==1,{},Flatten[Cases[FactorInteger[n],{p_,k_}:>Table[PrimePi[p],{k}]]]];
%t A359908 Select[Range[100],IntegerQ[Median[prix[#]]]&]
%Y A359908 The odd-length case is A027193.
%Y A359908 For mean instead of median we have A316413.
%Y A359908 These partitions are counted by A325347, strict A359907.
%Y A359908 The complement is A359912, counted by A307683.
%Y A359908 The median of prime indices is given by A360005/2.
%Y A359908 The case of integer mean also is A360009.
%Y A359908 A112798 lists prime indices, length A001222, sum A056239.
%Y A359908 A359893 and A359901 count partitions by median, odd-length A359902.
