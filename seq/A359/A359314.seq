%N A359314 Three-column table T(n,k) read by rows where the elements in the pair of two adjacent rows, starting with the odd-indexed row T(2j-1,k) and followed by the even-indexed one T(2j,k)), are such that they are not multiples of the elements presented in the previous rows and that Sum_{k=1..3} T(2j-1,k)^2 = Sum_{k=1..3} T(2j,k)^2 and Sum_{k=1..3} T(2j-1,k)^6 = Sum_{k=1..3} T(2j,k)^6 for j > 0 and k = 1, 2, 3.
%C A359314 It was found empirically (via computer calculations) that for integers a, b, c, d, e and f satisfying a^6 + b^6 + c^6 = d^6 + e^6 + f^6, it is also most likely to be true that a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = d^2 + e^2 + f^2.
%C A359314 Such cases are presented in this sequence where
%C A359314   a = T(2j-1,1), b = T(2j-1,2) c = T(2j-1,3) and
%C A359314   d = T(2j,1), e = T(2j,2), f = T(2j,3).
%C A359314 There currently exists no formula to calculate terms of this sequence -- they have to be found via trial and test (computer) calculations.
%C A359314 Each row consists of 3 columns.
%C A359314 The table starts with the rows which have the smallest sums of squares of elements (such sums also correspond to the smallest sums of the same 6th powers of the same elements) -- see the EXAMPLE section. The terms in each row are presented in ascending order.
