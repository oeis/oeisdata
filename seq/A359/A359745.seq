%N A359745 Numbers k such that k and k+1 have the same ordered prime signature.
%C A359745 The ordered prime signature of a number n is the list of exponents of the distinct prime factors in the prime factorization of n, in the order of the prime factors (A124010).

%e A359745 14 is a term since 14 = 2^1 * 7^1 and 15 = 3^1 * 5^1 have the same ordered prime signature, (1, 1).
%e A359745 44 is a term since 44 = 2^2 * 11^1 and 45 = 3^2 * 5^1 have the same ordered prime signature, (2, 1).
%e A359745 75 is a term of A052213 but not a term of this sequence, since 75 = 3^1 * 5^2 and 76 = 2^2 * 19^1 have different ordered prime signatures, (1, 2) and (2, 1).
