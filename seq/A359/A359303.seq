%N A359303 Bitwise encoding of the state of a 1D cellular automaton after n steps from ..111000.. where adjacent cells swap 01 <-> 10 when within triples 110 or 011.
%C A359303 This automaton is a toy model for diffusion.
%C A359303 The state is a bi-infinite string of 1's and 0's of the form ...1111 middle 0000...
%C A359303 The state is encoded in an integer by discarding the left infinite 1's and one 0 which follows, then interpret the rest left to right as binary least to most significant bit.
%C A359303 The state steps by locating all cells which will swap, and applying those swaps simultaneously.
%C A359303 In pattern 110, the 10 cells swap to become 01, and conversely in pattern 011 the 01 cells swap to become 10.
%C A359303 Patterns can overlap so that for example 0110 is an 011 and a 110 and the two swaps step to 1001.
%C A359303 Swaps conflict in a pattern 11011 since they try to swap the 0 both to the left and to the right. When this happens, neither of these conflicting swaps are applied
%C A359303 At least one swap always occurs since the right-most 11 pair is followed by 0 and this 110 has no further 11 after which would conflict.
%C A359303 The total number of 1's and 0's is preserved in each state (when taking some large enough part of the bi-infinite state).
