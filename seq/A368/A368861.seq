%N A368861 Even numbers n such that there is only one beta-stable nuclide with mass number n.
%C A368861 A beta-stable nuclide is a nuclide whose beta decay (beta-minus and beta-plus decay) is energetically disallowed; that is to say, a nuclide that has lower energy than its isobars with one more or one less proton. Note that double beta decay is allowed. A nuclide whose beta decay is energetially allowed, even if not observed (in the case of 48Ca, 96Zr, 123Te, 148Gd, 180mTa, 222Rn and 247Cm), is not classified as being beta-stable.
%C A368861 For even n <= 256 not being a term in this sequence, there are two beta-stable isobar with mass number n, except that there are three for n = 124, 130, 136, 150 and 154.
%C A368861 146 is not a term because even if 146Sm is unstable, it is beta-stable (in fact having lower energy than the stable 146Nd).
%C A368861 48 is a term because even if 48Ca is stable, it is not beta-stable.
%C A368861 Pages 14-15 of the Hiroyuki Koura link predict only one further term 298 (corresponding to 298Fl) up to 332.
