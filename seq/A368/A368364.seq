%N A368364 a(n) = number of s with n^k-n^2 <= s <= n^k-1, k >= 3, such that a comma sequence in base n with initial term s will not reach n^k.
%C A368364 Conjectured to have g.f. (Sum_{n>=1} x^((n^2+3*n)/2)/(1-x^n) - x^2)/(1-x). [Corrected by _N. J. A. Sloane_, May 14 2024]
%C A368364 a(n) is independent of k provided k >= 3.
%C A368364 This is conjectured to equal A368363(n) - 1. Normally that would be enough to rule out this sequence. However, it is included because it is at present the only one of the nearly 100 OEIS entries based on comma sequences which has a connection with a sequence not connected with comma sequences.
%C A368364 (In the (virtual) graph that shows connections between OEIS entries, this sequence is the sole node at present that connects the component containing A121805 to the rest of the graph.)
