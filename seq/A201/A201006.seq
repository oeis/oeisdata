%N A201006 The Isis problem: Array a(i,j) (by antidiagonals) of differences between area and perimeter of rectangle with sides (i,j).
%C A201006 Quotation from the reference: "Which rectangles with integer sides (in some unit) have the property that the area and the perimeter are (numerically) equal? It is not difficult to prove that there are precisely two rectangles with integer sides (in some unit of length) that have the property that the area and perimeter are numerically equal, namely 4 X 4 and 3 X 6".
