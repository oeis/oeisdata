%N A050945 Six consecutive integers with decreasing values of sigma start at these numbers: sigma(x) > sigma(x+1) > sigma(x+2) > sigma(x+3) > sigma(x+4) > sigma(x+5).
%C A050945 There are many examples of 4 consecutive numbers having decreasing values of sigma (see cross references) and there are 83 cases of 6 consecutive numbers with decreasing values of sigma < 4,293,000,000. Interestingly (and for unknown reasons) there are no examples of exactly 5 such consecutive numbers in that range! All known members of the sequence are multiples of 6 and one less than a multiple of 35.
