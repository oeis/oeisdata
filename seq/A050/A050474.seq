%N A050474 Solutions to 2*phi(x) = x+1.
%C A050474 If n is in the sequence and n+2 is prime then m=n*(n+2) is in the sequence because 2*phi(m) = 2*phi(n*(n+2)) = 2*phi(n)*(n+1) = (n+1)^2 = m+1. We can obtain the terms 3, 15, 255, 65535 & 4294967295 from 1 (the first term) in this way. Also since 83623935 is a term and 83623935+2 is prime 83623935*(83623935+2)=6992962672132095 is in the sequence. So 1 and 83623935 are the only known independent terms and next term of this sequence if it exists is the third such term. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, May 01 2007
%C A050474 The next term, if it exists, has at least 7 distinct prime factors (see Beiler, p. 92). - _Jud McCranie_, Dec 13 2012
%C A050474 From _Chris Boyd_, Mar 22 2015: (Start)
%C A050474 Solutions to k*phi(x) = x + 1, including a(1) - a(8), were published in 1932 by D. H. Lehmer. In the paper's summing up, "3*5*353*929" (= 4919055) was printed in error; it should have read "3*5*17*353*929" (= 83623935), i.e., a(6). This error has been propagated in several subsequent texts, including Wong's thesis.
%C A050474 Lehmer identified solutions where x has fewer than 7 distinct prime factors. Wong showed that no additional solutions exist unless x has at least 8 distinct prime factors. It appears not to be excluded by either author that an unidentified solution < a(8) with 8 or more distinct prime factors may exist. (End)
%C A050474 There are no other terms below 10^30. - _Max Alekseyev_, Jan 30 2026

%F A050474 A number n is in the sequence iff phi(n^2)=1+2+3+...+n because n is in the sequence <=> 2*phi(n)=n+1 <=> n*phi(n)=n*(n+1)/2 <=> phi(n^2)=1+2+3++...+n. For n=1,2,...,5, a(n)=2^2^(n-1)-1. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Jan 26 2006
%e A050474 2*phi(15) = 2*8 = 15 + 1, so 15 is a member of the sequence.
