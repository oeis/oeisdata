%N A050998 Inequivalent solutions to Langford (or Langford-Skolem) problem of arranging the numbers 1,1,2,2,3,3,...,n,n so that there is one number between the two 1's, two numbers between the two 2's, ..., n numbers between the two n's, listed by length and lexicographic order.
%C A050998 Entries are indexed by numbers n == -1 or 0 mod 4 (A014601).
%C A050998 More precisely, for each given n = (3, 4, 7, 8, ...) in A014601, all of the A014552(n) inequivalent solutions are listed in lexicographic order. For example,  a(1), a(2) and a(3) correspond to n=3, 4 and 7, but a(4) is not the first solution for n=8 but the second solution for n=7. - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 12 2015
%C A050998 "Inequivalent" means that for two solutions related by symmetry (reading the digits backwards), only the (lexicographic) smaller one is listed. - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 15 2015
%C A050998 It is unclear how the sequence goes on after the first 1+1+26+150 terms, with the solutions for n >= 11. Will a solution s=(s[1],...,s[n]) be coded again by Sum_{i=1..n} s[i]*b^(n-i) in base b=10, or in some larger base b >= n+1? Maybe using as many decimal digits as needed, i.e., b=100 for 11 <= n <= 99? - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 16 2015

%e A050998 The first n which allows a solution (A014552(n) > 0; n in A014601) is n=3, the solutions are a(1) = 231213 and the same read backwards, 312132.
%e A050998 The next solutions are given for n=4, again there is only A014552(4)=1 solution a(2) = 23421314 up to reversal (41312432, not listed).
