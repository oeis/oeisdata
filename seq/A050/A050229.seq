%N A050229 Numbers k such that for any x in 1..k-1 there exists a y in 0..k-2 such that x^2 == 2^y (mod k).
%C A050229 It seems that the sequence consists of {1,2} union A001122. The sequence differs from A082595 because here the multiplicity is not important (see example: P contains two 5's and Q is required to have at least one 5, not necessarily 2 5's).
%C A050229 Numbers k for which there is a permutation of 0..k-1 such that each number is the sum of all the previous numbers, plus 1, mod k. - _R. H. Hardin_, Dec 28 2007
%C A050229 Positive numbers k such that x^(k-1) + x^(k-2) + x^(k-3) + ... + x + 1 is irreducible over GF(2). - _Arkadiusz Wesolowski_, Nov 20 2012
%C A050229 All terms > 1 are prime. Appears to be set of numbers k such that the sequence 2^n mod k has period length of k-1. - _Gary Detlefs_, May 15 2014
%F A050229 a(n) = A071642(n) + 1. - _Arkadiusz Wesolowski_, Nov 20 2012
%e A050229 The set of values for x^2 mod 19, 1<=x<=18, is P=[1, 4, 9, 16, 6, 17, 11, 7, 5, 5, 7, 11, 17, 6, 16, 9, 4, 1], the set of values for 2^y mod 19, 0<=y<=n-2 is Q= [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 13, 7, 14, 9, 18, 17, 15, 11, 3, 6, 12, 5, 10] which contains all values in P, hence 19 is in the sequence.
