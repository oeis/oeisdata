%N A306746 A Goldbug number is an even number 2m for which there exists a subset of the prime non-divisors P={p1, p2, p3, ..., pk} of 2m, where (2m-p1)*(2m-p2)*(2m-p3)*...*(2m-pk) has only elements of P as prime factors, and max(P) is strictly between m/2 and m.
%C A306746 A Goldbug number is an even number 2m for which there exists some subset of the prime non-divisors (PNDs) of 2m, 2 < p1 < p2 < p3 < ... < pk < m, such that (2m-p1)*(2m-p2)*(2m-p3)*...*(2m-pk) has only p1,p2,p3,...,pk as factors and pk > m/2. We do not need to consider the case where m is prime, since then (m,m) is itself a Goldbach pair. A Goldbug number is called "order-k" if the maximal subset satisfying the property is of size k.
%C A306746 These numbers arise from Goldbug's Algorithm which attempts to find a Goldbach pair for a particular even number by starting with a given PND p1 and successively adding the factors of the product (2m - p1)*...*(2m - pk) to the search until a pair is found. Goldbug numbers are those even numbers for which Goldbug's Algorithm is not guaranteed to find a Goldbach pair since it could reach a subset of the PNDs which does not contain new information about additional PNDs to add to the search.
%C A306746 Goldbug numbers are a special case of Basic Pipes as defined by Wu. It has been shown computationally a(7) > 5*10^8. See link.
%C A306746 Goldbug numbers serve as a link between Goldbach's conjecture and the Pillai conjecture since order-2 Goldbug numbers represent solutions to its generalized difference equation. For example, sequence A057896 demonstrates there are no order 2 Goldbugs less than 10^24 since it would imply additional solutions to the equation a^x-a = b^y-b. In fact, theorem 3 from Scott[1993] implies that no additional order 2 Goldbugs exist at all.

%e A306746 A higher-order example is the term 128, for which there exists a subset of the PNDs such that the corresponding product (128 - 3)*(128 - 5)*(128 - 7)*(128 - 11)*(128 - 13)*(128 - 17)*(128 - 23)*(128 - 29)*(128 - 37)*(128 - 41)*(128 - 43)*(128 - 47)*(128 - 53)*(128 - 59) = 8147166895749452778629296875 = (3^14)*(5^8)*(7^2)*(11^3)*(13^2)*17*(23^2)*29*37*41 and 59 in the interval (128/4,128/2) = (32,64). Therefore, 128 is a Goldbug number of order k=14.
%e A306746 Although 2m = 2200 and the prime non-divisors 3 and 13 might seem to satisfy the definition since (2200 - 13)*(2200 - 3) = 4804839 = 3^7*13^3, 2200 is not an order k=2 Goldbug since 13 < m/2 = 2200/4 = 550.
