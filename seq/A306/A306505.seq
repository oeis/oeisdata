%N A306505 Number of non-isomorphic antichains of nonempty subsets of {1,...,n}.
%C A306505 The spanning case is A006602 or A261005. The labeled case is A014466.

%C A306505 a(n) is the number of "types" of log-linear hierarchical models on n factors in the sense of _Colin Mallows_ (see the emails to _N. J. A. Sloane_).
%C A306505 Two hierarchical models on n factors belong to the same "type" iff one can obtained from the other by a permutation of the factors.
%C A306505 The total number of hierarchical log-linear models on n factors (in all "types") is given by A014466(n) = A000372(n) - 1.
%C A306505 The name of a hierarchical log-linear model on factors is based on the collection of maximal interaction terms, which must be an antichain (by the definition of maximality).
%C A306505 In his example on p. 1, _Colin Mallows_ groups the A014466(3) = 19 hierarchical log-linear models on n = 3 factors x, y, z into a(3) = 9 types. See my example below for more details. (End)
%C A306505 First differs from A348260(n + 1) - 1 at a(5) = 209, A348260(6) - 1 = 232. - _Gus Wiseman_, Nov 28 2021

%e A306505 We expand _Colin Mallows_'s example from p. 1 of his list of 1991 emails. For n = 3, we have the following a(3) = 9 "types" of log-linear hierarchical models:
%e A306505 Type 1: ( ), Type 2: (x), (y), (z), Type 3: (x,y), (y,z), (z,x), Type 4: (x,y,z), Type 5: (xy), (yz), (zx), Type 6: (xy,z), (yz,x), (zx,y), Type 7: (xy,xz), (yx,yz), (zx,zy), Type 8: (xy,yz,zx), Type 9: (xyz).
%e A306505 For each model, the name only contains the maximal terms. See p. 36 in Wickramasinghe (2008) for the full description of the 19 models.
%e A306505 Strictly speaking, I should have used set notation (rather than parentheses) for the name of each model, but I follow the tradition of the theory of log-linear models. In addition, in an interaction term such as xy, the order of the factors is irrelevant.
%e A306505 Models in the same type essentially have similar statistical properties.
%e A306505 For example, models in Type 7 have the property that two factors are conditionally independent of one another given each level (= category) of the third factor.
%e A306505 Models in Type 6 are such that two factors are jointly independent from the third one. (End)
