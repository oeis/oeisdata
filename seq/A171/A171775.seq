%N A171775 a(n) = smallest number M such that there exist bases b_2, b_3, ..., b_n with the property that M written in base b_k is a k-digit palindrome for all k=2..n.
%C A171775 a(n) is no more than 2^[(n-1)*(n-2)] for n > 6 (and equals it for n = 7 and 8 at least).  The reason for this bound is that for this number for each length from n down to 3 there is at least one power of 2, 2^k, such that in base b = 2^k-1 the binomial expansion of (b+1)^floor([(n-1)*(n-2)]/k) multiplied by the remaining small power of 2 gives a palindromic expression not requiring carries in base b. _James G.
