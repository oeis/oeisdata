%N A171885 Representation of n in D. E. Knuth's second prefix-unambiguous, order-preserving binary string system.
%C A171885 The first two terms are the strings "00" and "01"; all others are binary strings beginning with "1".
%C A171885 With the important exception of a(1) = 1, when expressed in binary, any value not appearing in this sequence appears as an initial substring of later terms. For example, 6 (110) is an initial substring of 27 (11011).

%e A171885 The representations start: 0 = "00"; 1 = "01"; 2 = "100"; 3 = "101"; 4 = "11000"; 5 = "11001"; 6 = "11010"; 7 = "11011"; 8 = "1110000"; 9 = "1110001"; and so on. See the references for longer lists and fuller explanation.
%Y A171885 Knuth's first system gives A000918 (less its initial term).
%Y A171885 Knuth's third system is A010097, the Levenshtein codes.
