%N A135317 Let h(2*n, 1) = 2*n and h(2*n, m) = h(2*n, m-1) + 2 * d(2*n, m) for m > 1, where d(2*n, m) = (least multiple of m not less than h(2*n, m-1)) - h(2*n, m-1). Then d(2*n, m) is eventually 2-periodic as a function of m, and a(n) is defined as d(2*n, 2*m+1) for large m.
%C A135317 Sequence yielding an ordering of N*N derived from a family of recurrences.
%C A135317 For any integer k define h(k,1)=k and for m>1 define h(k,m)=h(k,m-1)+2*((-h(k,m-1)) mod m) where "r mod s" denotes least nonnegative residue of r modulo s [informally, h(k,m) is got by "reflecting" h(k,m-1) in the least multiple of m that is >=h(k,m-1)]. Then for fixed k>=0 there are integers c(k), b(k), m(k) such that for all m>m(k) we have h(k,2*m+1)-h(k,2*m)=2*c(k) and h(k,2*m+2)-h(k,2*m+1)=2*b(k). [In the terms of the function d defined in the Name, c(k) = d(k, 2*m+1) and b(k) = d(k, 2*m+2) for all m>m(k).]
%C A135317 For all n we have c(2*n+1)=c(2*n) and b(2*n+1)=1+b(2*n). Moreover b(2*n) is even for all n. The function n->(c(2*n),b(2*n)/2) is a bijection from the nonnegative integers N to N*N [as well as n->(b(n),c(n))]. It is "monotone" in the sense that n<=n' whenever c(2*n)<=c(2*n') and b(2*n)<=b(2*n').
%C A135317 This sequence is a(n) = c(2*n).
%C A135317 The results on which the definition is based are not yet proved, but they are plausible and overwhelmingly supported by numerical evidence.
%C A135317 For each fixed m, k->h(k,m) is a bijection Z->Z (this is easy!). However for k<0 the sequence h(k,m) does not have the pseudo-periodic property we have used in defining c(k) and b(k).
%C A135317 m(k) appears to be O(sqrt k).
%C A135317 From _Andrei Zabolotskii_, Dec 28 2024: (Start)
%C A135317 See my Github link for the proof that the sequence is indeed well-defined.
%C A135317 That fact is equivalent to the quantity d(k,m) + d(k,m+1) eventually becoming constant. That constant value can be first reached when m is odd (case B) or even (case C).
%C A135317 On the plane (b(k), c(k)), the points from case B (resp. case C) fall in the region which is approximately the octant b(k) > c(k) (resp. c(k) > b(k)).
%C A135317 On the plane (x=n, y=a(n)), the graph of this sequence fills in a certain region in the plane. It's bounded from below by the line y=0 and from above, it seems, by the curve y = sqrt(Pi*x). That region, it seems, is further divided into two parts: the one below the curve y = sqrt((4/Pi)*x) contains points from case B, the one above it contains points from case C. The latter part looks more dense on the graph. (End)

%F A135317 It appears that a(n) = A319573(A252448(2*n+1)) [discovered by Sequence Machine], moreover, c(n) = A319573(n') and b(n) = A319572(n') with n' = A252448(n), where b and c are described above. - _Andrei Zabolotskii_, Apr 28 2023
%e A135317 h(18,m) for m>=1 goes 18,18,18,22,28,32,38,42,48...so we can take m(18) = 2, then 2*c(18)=28-22=38-32=48-42=...=6, so a(9) = c(18) = 3 and similarly b(18) = 2.
