%N A135571 Positive integers that are the difference of two positive triangular numbers in an odd number of ways.
%C A135571 Conjecture. This sequence is just the sequence of positive integers that are either square, twice a square, or triangular, but not both square and triangular (A001110). (This has been verified for n up to 100000.)
%C A135571 If the triangular number 0 is allowed, then Verhoeff has shown (see the reference) that the numbers that are the difference of two triangular numbers in exactly one way are just the powers of 2.

%e A135571 As differences of two positive triangular numbers, 6 =21-15 (1 way), 9 =10-1 =15-6 =45-36 (3 ways), so 6 and 9 are terms of the sequence; 5 =6-1 = 15-10 (2 ways), so 5 is not a term of the sequence.
