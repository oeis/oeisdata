%N A147983 A sequence from a 3 X n Chomp game, see the first comment.
%C A147983 Values of r where a P-position (p,q,r) has a pattern. This algorithm is very efficient. When the length of a period and the start matrix are not of interest (only whether r has or does not have a pattern), the algorithm generates the sequence: 120, 400, 402, ..., 10501, 10583, 10585 very quickly.
%C A147983 First step: generate all the P-positions, where, for example, n = 15000. Second step: run the algorithm.
%C A147983 From _Petros Hadjicostas_, Apr 11 2020: (Start)
%C A147983 From A. E. Brouwer's website (see below): "Chomp is a game played on a partially ordered set P with smallest element 0. A move consists of picking an element x of P and removing x and all larger elements from P. Whoever picks 0 loses."
%C A147983 "In 3-by-n Chomp, a game position is (p,q,r) with p not less than q and q not less than r.
%C A147983 If r = 0 then this is really 2-by-n Chomp, and the P-positions (previous player wins) are those with p = q+1.
%C A147983 If r = 1, the only P-positions are (3,1,1) and (2,2,1).
%C A147983 If r = 2, the P-positions are those with p = q+2.
%C A147983 If r = 3, the P-positions are (6,3,3), (7,4,3) and (5,5,3).
%C A147983 If r = 4, the P-positions are (8,4,4), (9,5,4), (10,6,4) and (7,7,4).
%C A147983 If r = 5, the P-positions are (10,5,5), (9,6,5) and (a+11,a+7,5) for nonnegative a." (For more details, see his web page.) (End)
