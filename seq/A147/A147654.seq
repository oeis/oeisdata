%e A147654 From the positive integers 1,2,3,..., construct the series 1+x+2x^2+3x^3+4x^4+... a(1) is always the coefficient of x, here 1. Divide by (1+a(1)x), i.e. here (1+x), to get the quotient (1+a(2)x^2+...), which here gives a(2)=2. Then divide this quotient by (1+a(2)x^2), i.e. here (1+2x^2), to get (1+a(3)x^3+...), giving a(3)=1.
