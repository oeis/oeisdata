%N A147882 Positive integers k that are balanced, meaning that if k has d digits, then its initial ceiling(d/2) digits have the same sum as its last ceiling(d/2) digits.
%C A147882 Differs from A110751 in cases like n=1010, 1089, 1102, 1120, 1203, 1212, 1230, etc. - _R. J. Mathar_, Dec 13 2008

%e A147882 From _David A. Corneth_, Sep 28 2023: (Start)
%e A147882 353 is a term as it has k = 3 digits and so we see that the sum of the first ceiling(k/2) = ceiling(3/2) = 2 and the last ceiling(k/2) = ceiling(3/2) = 2 are equal and indeed 3 + 5 = 5 + 3.
%e A147882 13922 is a term as it has k = 5 digits and so we see that the sum of the first ceiling(k/2) = ceiling(5/2) = 2 and the last ceiling(k/2) = ceiling(5/2) = 2 are equal and indeed 1 + 3 + 9 = 9 + 2 + 2. (End)
