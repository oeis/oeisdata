%N A147980 Given a set of positive integers A={1,2,...,n-1,n}, n>=2. Take subsets of A of the form {1,...,n} so only subsets containing numbers 1 and n are allowed. Then a(1)=1 and a(n) is the number of subsets where arithmetic mean of the subset is an integer.
%C A147980 For n odd the value of the arithmetic mean for each possible subset equals (n+1)/2. For n even this value is n/2 or (n+2)/2. If looking after RootMeanSquare for the subset we obtain a sequence [1,0,0,0,0,0,2,...]. We see for example for n=7, A={1,2,3,4,5,6,7} and the only 2 subsets with an integer RootMeanSquare are {1,7}, {1,5,7}. Interestingly the value of RootMeanSquare is 5 for both subsets. So the sequence A140480 RMS numbers is a subsequence of it as a set of divisors of n is clearly a subset of n of the form {1,...,n}.

%e A147980 n=5, A={1,2,3,4,5}. Subsets of A starting with 1 and ending with 5 are : {1,5}, {1,2,5}, {1,3,5}, {1,4,5}, {1,2,3,5}, {1,2,4,5}, {1,3,4,5}, {1,2,3,4,5}. Arithmetic mean of the subset is an integer for subsets : {1,5}, {1,3,5}, {1,2,4,5}, {1,2,3,4,5}. Thus a(5) = 4. The value of the arithmetic mean is 3 for all 4 subsets.
