%N A147796 Number of consistent sets of 3 irreflexive binary order relationships over n objects.
%C A147796 From _Petros Hadjicostas_, Apr 10 2020: (Start)
%C A147796 Here is a proof of the formula for a(n). There are n*(n-1) irreflexive binary order relationships among n distinct objects and binomial(n*(n-1), 3) 3-sets of such relationships.
%C A147796 We first exclude the 3-sets that contain both relationships of the form x < y and y < x (with x <> y), and there are (n*(n-1)/2) *(n*(n-1) - 2) such 3-sets.
%C A147796 Next we exclude the 3-sets that contain all the relationships of the form x < y, y < z, and z < x (with x, y, z distinct), and there are 2*binomial(n,3) of these.
%C A147796 The two groups of excluded 3-sets do not overlap, and the formula has been proved.
%C A147796 It seems that a(n) = A081064(n,3) = number of labeled acyclic directed graphs with n nodes and k = 3 arcs (see Rodionov (1992)). The reason is that we may label the graphs with the n objects and draw an arc from X towards Y if and only if X < Y. The 3 arcs of the directed graph correspond to the 3-set of binary order relationships and they are consistent because the directed graph is acyclic.

%e A147796 For n = 3, consider objects a, b, c. There are 3*2 = 6 irreflexive binary order relationships among these objects (a < b, b < a, a < c, c < a, b < c, c < b). For a set of 3 such sets of binary relationships to be consistent, x < y and y < x should not appear together, and x < y, y < z, and z < x should not be together. We have the following sets of 3 such relationships that are consistent: {x < y, y < z, x < z}, where (x,y,z) is in S_3. Thus, a(3) = |S_3| = 3! = 6. (End)
