%N A338488 Numbers n whose symmetric representation of sigma(n) has a maximum width of 2 that occurs exactly once (at the diagonal).
%C A338488 For numbers n in the sequence the symmetric representation of sigma(n) consists of an odd number of regions. The geometric form for a single width 2 at the diagonal requires that
%C A338488 (a) the length of the last leg of the n-th Dyck path is A237591(n,row(n)) = 1 and the leg horizontal, which implies that row(n) is odd, and
%C A338488 (b) the length of the last leg of the (n-1)-st Dyck path is A237591(n-1,row(n-1)) = 2 and the leg vertical, which implies that row(n-1) = row(n) - 1 is even:

%C A338488   |   |_
%C A338488   |_ _
%C A338488 Therefore, n is a hexagonal number (see A000384) and row(n) is an odd divisor of n since otherwise the central region of the symmetric representation for sigma(n) defined by the largest odd divisor d < row(n) would create an extent of width 2 larger than 1.
%C A338488 Since all other regions must have width 1 the following conditions characterize the numbers in this sequence:
%C A338488 Let 1 = d_1 < d_2 < ... < d_s <= row(n) < d_(s+1) < ... < d_t = q be all odd divisors of n = 2^k * q, k >= 0. n is hexagonal, 2^(k+1) * d_i < d_(i+1), for 1 <= i <= s-2, and d_s = row(n), so that 2^(k+1) * d_(s-1) = d_s + 1.
%C A338488 The numbers of this sequence can be arranged as a table according to the number of regions (one fewer than the number of its odd divisors) in the symmetric representation of sigma(n):

%C A338488 The numbers less than 25000 in the first four columns were computed using function a338488[] while the numbers in the remaining two columns and the first even numbers in the 5-column and 7-column were computed by a function implementing the conditions on the structure of the odd divisors.
%C A338488 The 1-column consists of the even perfect numbers, A000396.
%C A338488 The 3-column is the sequence of numbers n =2^k * p * q, p & q odd primes, such that 2^(k+1) < p < q < 2^(k+1)*p = q+1. It is a subsequence of A338486, and includes the odd numbers in A129521 since (q+1)/2 = p is prime.
%C A338488 The odd numbers in the 5-column have 6 divisors and therefore form a subsequence in A116565.
%C A338488 Conjecture: For every odd number 2k-1 there is an even number n in this sequence whose symmetric representation of sigma(n) has 2k-1 regions.
%e A338488 a(5) = 153 = 17*3^2 is in the sequence and in the 5-column of the table since 1 < 2 < 3 < 6 < 3^2 < 17 = row(153) < 2*3^2 representing the 6 odd divisors 1 - 153 - 3 - 51 - 9 - 17 (see A237048) results in the following pattern for the widths of its 17 legs (see A249223): 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2 for 5 regions with a single unit of width 2.
%e A338488 a(6) = 190 = 2*5*19 is in the sequence and in the 3-column of the table since 1 < 4 < 5 < 19 = row(190) < 4*5 representing the 4 odd divisors 1 - 190 - 5 - 19 results in the following pattern for the widths of its 19 legs: 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2 for 3 regions with a single unit of width 2.
%e A338488 Number 66 = 2*3*11 is not in the sequence since positions 1 < 3 < 4 < 11 = row(66) < 4*3 representing the 4 odd divisors 1 - 3 - 33 - 11 violate the condition 4 = 4*d_1 < d_2 = 3; its symmetric representation of sigma consists of a single region in which the third leg and its symmetric copy have width 2 in addition to a single unit of width 2 at the diagonal.
