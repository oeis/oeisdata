%N A338050 Fixed points in A336957.
%C A338050 These are the values of n such that A336957(n) = n. Is this sequence finite or infinite?. We do not know. Also, why are the terms (except the first, which is special) even?
%C A338050 The known values of n such that A336957(n) = n+1 are 43, 103, 191, 203, 207, 211, 243, 247, 251, 287, 291, 303, 327, 399, 8133, 71071, 579451, 10955983. Are there more terms? We do not know. Also, why are all the terms odd?
%C A338050 The known values of n such that A336957(n) = n-1 are 31, 87, 187, 215, 255, 283, 307, 315, 347, 551, 10697, 30525, 46195, 478607, 3856311, 6405255. Same questions!
