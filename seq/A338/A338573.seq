%N A338573 Array read by ascending antidiagonals: T(m,n) (m, n >= 1) is the minimum number of unit resistors needed to produce resistance m/n.
%C A338573 Karnofsky (2004, p. 5): "[...] if some circuit has resistance m/n then some other circuit likely has n/m. In fact, for 9 or fewer resistors, this symmetry is perfect. However, for 10 resistors the following values are achieved, but not their inverses: 95/106, 101/109, 98/103, 97/98, 103/101, 97/86, 110/91, 103/83, 130/101, 103/80, 115/89, 106/77, 109/77, 98/67, 101/67". That means, that T(m,n) = T(n,m), if T(m,n) <= 9.
%C A338573 This starts with the values of A113881, but the Karnofsky comment says that T(n,m) is not symmetric, whereas the count of tiles in A113881 is. - _R. J. Mathar_, Nov 06 2020
%C A338573 The first difference where T(m,n) = T(n,m), but differs from the corresponding entry of A113881 occurs for (n,m) = (154,167) and (n,m) = (167,154), both representable by networks with non-planar graphs of 11 resistors, whereas A113881 counts 12 tiles. See Pfoertner link for illustration of more differences. - _Hugo Pfoertner_, Nov 13 2020

%e A338573 T(1,2) = 2: at least 2 unit resistors in parallel are needed for resistance 1/2.
