%N A338772 The number of different probabilities p for which a coin that lands heads with probability p can, using n flips, perfectly model one flip of a fair coin.
%C A338772 This counts the distinct roots in the range 0 to 1 occurring among a set of degree-n polynomials the number of which is given by A055612. The 2^n possible outcomes of n coin flips are divided into n + 1 classes depending on how many times heads comes up, and there is one polynomial for each way of deciding how many of each class goes on which side of the partition of outcomes that will model a fair coin flip.

%e A338772 For n = 2 the a(2) = 3 different values of p are, in increasing order:
%e A338772 1 - sqrt(1/2), which can model a fair flip with the partition (HH, HT, TH), (TT);
%e A338772 1/2, which can model a fair flip with the partition (HH, HT), (TH, TT) (i.e., by ignoring the second flip); and
%e A338772 sqrt(1/2), which can model a fair flip with the partition (HH), (HT, TH, TT).
