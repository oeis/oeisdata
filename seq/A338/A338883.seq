%N A338883 Orders of elements of the Rubik's Cube group.
%C A338883 The Rubik's Cube group G is a subgroup of the symmetric group S_48 of order |G| = 43252003274489856000 = 2^27 * 3^14 * 5^3 * 7^2 * 11, generated by the six face twists of the cube. The elements of G have 73 distinct orders. The exponent of G, given by the least common multiple of the orders of the elements, is 55440.

%e A338883 10 is in the sequence because the algorithm U R U' F2 (in Singmaster notation) has order 10.
%e A338883 13 is not in the sequence because 13 is a prime not dividing the order of the group.
