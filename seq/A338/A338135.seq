%N A338135 Irregular triangle read by rows: Row p gives number of non-overlapping clusters of 2q-plets joining 2p points on a circle, i.e., number of noncrossing partitions from A134264 with h_k for k odd replaced by zero.
%C A338135 This combinatorial problem arises in relating connected and disconnected Green functions associated to a "zero-dimensional" quantum field theory presented by Brezin et al. in "Planar Diagrams" via Eqn. 31 on p. 42.
%C A338135 Appears to be a refinement of A120986 and A108767 in that summing the coefficients of partitions with the same sum of exponents gives the rows or reverse rows of the two entries; for example, row 4 here becomes x + 8 xx + 4 x^2 + 28 x^2x + 14 x^4 = x + 12 x^2 + 28 x^3 + 14 x^4, which is row 4 of A108767. In short, replace each g_k or (k) by x in the formula section here to obtain the coarser entry or its reverse from this refined entry, apparently.
%C A338135 This also gives the relationship between moments and free cumulants in free probability theory restricted to an even number of noncrossing partitions as given by restricting the similar enumeration formuia on p. 34 of Novak and LaCroix to b_{2n} = G_{2n} and K_{2q} = g_{2q}. This is consistent with setting h_k to zero for odd k in A134264, e.g., doing so for the coefficients of t^7 for g(t) there gives G_6 here.
%C A338135 A125181 is another version of A134264, providing interpretations in terms of Dyck paths and trees.
