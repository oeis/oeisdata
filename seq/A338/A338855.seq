%N A338855 Concatenating all successive absolute differences between two successive digits of a(n) produce a subchain of a(n).
%C A338855 This is the lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive terms with this property.
%e A338855 a(1) = 10 is in the sequence because the absolute difference between 1 and 0 is 1, and 1 is a subchain of 10;
%e A338855 a(2) = 12 is in the sequence because the absolute difference between 1 and 2 is 1, and 1 is a subchain of 12;
%e A338855 a(3) = 20 is in the sequence because the absolute difference between 2 and 0 is 2, and 2 is a subchain of 20;
%e A338855 ...
%e A338855 a(20) = 124; the absolute difference between 1 and 2 is 1; the absolute difference between 2 and 4 is 2; concatenating those differences produce 12 and 12 is a subchain of 124; etc.
%Y A338855 Cf. A338640 [the concatenation produces a divisor of a(n)], A338641 [the starting numbers have no duplicated digits and the concatenation is a divisor of a(n)].
