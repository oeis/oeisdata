%N A338197 a(n) is the number of distinct resistances that can be obtained by a network of exactly n equal resistors, but not by any network with fewer than n equal resistors.
%C A338197 See A180414 and A337517 for more information and references.

%F A338197 a(n) = A180414(n) - A180414(n-1).
%F A338197 a(n) = A051389(n) for n <= 5, a(n) > A051389(n) otherwise.
%e A338197 a(6) = 44 because the resistances 11/13 and 13/11 (in units of resistor value) are representable in addition to the A051389(6)=42 resistances that can be achieved by only serial and parallel configurations with exactly 6 resistors and not by a network with fewer than 6 resistors.
