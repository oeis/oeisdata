%N A295157 Numbers that have exactly nine representations as a sum of five nonnegative squares.
%C A295157 This sequence is finite and complete. See the von Eitzen Link. For positive integer n, if n > 6501 then the number of ways to write n as a sum of 5 squares is at least 10. So for n > 6501, there are more than eight ways to write n as a sum of 5 squares. For n <= 6501, it has been verified if n is in the sequence by inspection. Hence the sequence is complete.
