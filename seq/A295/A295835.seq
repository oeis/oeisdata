%N A295835 Numbers k == 3 (mod 4) such that 2^((k-1)/2), 3^((k-1)/2) and 5^((k-1)/2) are congruent to 1 (mod k).
%C A295835 There are very few composite numbers in this sequence: The probability of catching a pseudoprime number (A001567) with this definition is estimated at 1 in 263 billion.
%C A295835 Composite numbers in the sequence include the Carmichael numbers 131314855918751, 23282264781147191, 70122000249565031, 104782993259720471, 583701149409931151, 870012810301712351. - _Robert Israel_, Nov 28 2017
%C A295835 With the exception of the pseudoprimes, it seems that this is a subsequence of A139035. Primes of this form (A139035) have two special properties. 1. There exists a smallest m of the form m = (A139035 - 1)/2 such that 2^m == 1 (mod A139035). 2. m is odd. The core of this definition is based on these two properties. The term 2^((k-1)/2) == 1 (mod n) is based on the first property, while the term k == 3 (mod 4) is based on the second property. The terms 3^((k-1)/2) == 1 (mod n) and 5^((k-1)/2) == 1 (mod n) I just tried freely to Fermat.
%C A295835 Not a subsequence of A139035: the exceptions begin 431, 911, 2351, .... - _Bill McEachen_, Sep 26 2025
%C A295835 Prime terms are congruent to 71 or 119 modulo 120. - _Jianing Song_, Nov 22 2018 [This is because 2, 3, and 5 must be quadratic residues modulo every prime number in this sequence. - _Jianing Song_, Sep 01 2024]
%C A295835 From _Jianing Song_, Sep 03 2024: (Start)
%C A295835 Compare this sequence to the sequence of absolute Euler pseudoprimes (A033181): odd composite numbers k such that a^((k-1)/2) == +-1 (mod k) for every a coprime to k. Such numbers k satisfy 2*psi(k) | (k-1), where psi = A002322, so we must have k == 1 (mod 4).
%C A295835 All terms in this sequence are congruent to 7 modulo 8. In fact, taking the Jacobi symbol modulo k (which only depends on the remainder modulo k) of both sides of 2^((k-1)/2) == 1 (mod k) yields (2/k)^((k-1)/2) = 1. Since k == 3 (mod 4), we have that (k-1)/2 is odd, so (2/k) = 1, which means that k == 7 (mod 8). (End)
%C A295835 Those numbers given above by _Robert Israel_ are all congruent to 71 modulo 120. There are no known composite terms congruent to 119 modulo 120; cf. A294092. - _Bill McEachen_ and _Jianing Song_, Sep 05 2024
