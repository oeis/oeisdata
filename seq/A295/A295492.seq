%N A295492 Numbers that have exactly nine representations as a sum of six nonnegative squares.
%C A295492 This sequence is finite and complete. See the von Eitzen Link and the proof in A294675 stating that for n > 6501, the number of ways to write n as a sum of 5 squares (without allowing zero squares) is at least 10. Since this sequence relaxes the restriction of zero squares and allows one more square, the number of representations for n > 6501 is at least ten. Then an inspection of n <= 6501 completes the proof.
