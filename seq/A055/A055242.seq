%N A055242 Largest base in which n is not divisible by any of its digits (0 if no such base).
%C A055242 If n is odd then a(n)<=(n-3)/2 since in base (n-1)/2 it is written 21, in bases (n+1)/2 through to n its first digit is 1 and in bases >n it is just itself as a single digit; and n is divisible by 1 and itself. If n is even then a(n)<=n/3 since in bases >n/3 through to n/2 its first digit is 2, in bases n/2+1 through to n its first digit is 1 and in bases >n it is just itself as a single digit; and n is divisible by 1, 2 and itself
%e A055242 a(11)=4 because it is written as 23 in base 4 and 11 is not divisible by 2 or 3; in every base from 5 through to 11 it has a digit 1 and in every base from 12 onwards it is simply digit 'eleven' - 11 is divisible by both 1 and 'eleven'
