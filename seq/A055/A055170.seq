%N A055170 n-th distinct number to appear in A055168; also the n-th to appear in A217760.
%C A055170 Conjecture: this sequence is a permutation of the nonnegative integers.
%C A055170 This is the limiting sequence of the noun-integers in the n-th segment generated as in A217760 (but not A055186); see Example.
%C A055170 The conjecture is true: the number 0 appears in every segment of A055168, and, for n > 0, n appears in the (n+1)-th segment (as the number of occurrences of 0 in the previous segments). - _Rémy Sigrist_, Oct 16 2017
