%N A055456 a(n) is the smallest number which is not the sum of exactly 1 or of n earlier terms.
%F A055456 If n-1 > 0 has not already appeared in sequence then a(n) = n-1, otherwise a(n) = n^2 - n + 1.
%e A055456 a(3)=2 because 1 is already in the sequence, 2 has not yet appeared (i.e., is not the sum of 1 earlier term), and the sum of 3 earlier terms is 3, 5 or 7.
%e A055456 a(4)=13 because 1, 2, and 3 have already appeared and the sum of 4 earlier terms could be any integer from 4 through 12.
%Y A055456 Cf. A035334. a(n) is not n-1 iff n-1 is in A024556 or equivalently in A002065.
