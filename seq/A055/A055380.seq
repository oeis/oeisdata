%F A055380 a(n) = A151800^(n)(A175309(2n)), i.e., A151800 applied n times on A175309(2n). - _Max Alekseyev_, Jul 26 2014
%e A055380 In 5-tuple of consecutive primes (18713, 18719, 18731, 18743, 18749), the primes are symmetric w.r.t. its central prime 18731, since 18713+18749 = 18719+18743 = 2*18731, and this is the smallest such 5-tuple. Hence, a(2)=18731.
%e A055380 Alternatively, the symmetry can be seen from the differences between consecutive primes. For (18713, 18719, 18731, 18743, 18749), the differences are (6,12,12,6).
