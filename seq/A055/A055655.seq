%N A055655 Efficient representation of n in "square base" where xyz means 9x+4y+z and z<4, y<9 and x<16 etc.
%C A055655 Efficient means the smallest possible a(n), cf. example. From n = 9*9+8*4+3 = 116 on, the terms (coded in base 10) become ambiguous because digits may be larger than 9, e.g., 1000 could mean 1*16 or 10*9. One possible convention to avoid ambiguity would be to reserve as many digits as might be required for the largest possible coefficient: 2 digits for the coefficients of 9 (which may reach 16-1 = 15) through 81; 3 digits for the coefficients of 100 through 30^2, 4 digits for the coefficients of 31^2 (which may reach 32^2-1 = 1023) etc. - _M.

%e A055655 a(50)=280 since 2*9+8*4+0*1=50; writing 20000 for 2*25 or 3xyz (for 3*16+x*9+y*4+z) or 5yz or 4yz or 3yz would be less efficient (larger "result" when read in base 10), and it is not possible to write 50 as 1*9+y*4+z*1 with y<9 and z<4.
