%N A055168 Cumulative counting sequence: method B (noun,adjective)-pairs with first term 0.
%C A055168 Write 0 followed by segments defined inductively as follows:  each segment tells how many times each previously written integer occurs, stating first the integer being counted and then its frequency.  This is Method B (noun-before-adjective); for Method A (adjective-before-noun), see A217760. - _Clark Kimberling_, Mar 25 2013
