%N A321151 Primes that yield squares after deletion of their zero digits.
%C A321151 Subsequence of A056709. The squares divisible by 2, 3 or 5 cannot be obtained. Most of the squares obtained seem to be squares of prime or semiprime numbers. Among the first 399 squares obtained are 289 squares of prime numbers, 104 squares of semiprimes and 6 other squares; these squares were obtained by testing the prime numbers up to 10^7. Deletion of the zero digits from primes up to 10^8 yields 929 squares of prime numbers, 506 squares of semiprimes and 47 other squares. Do similar results occur when larger primes are considered?
%C A321151 From _David A. Corneth_, Nov 26 2018: (Start)
%C A321151 Terms can be obtained by listing squares coprime to 30, inserting zeros between digits, and testing the primality of the resulting numbers.
%C A321151 Records for omega(s) where s is a square producing a term occur at terms 409, 50929, 10713481, 3601722361, 1531869148081, 807916258118689. (End)
