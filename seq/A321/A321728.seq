%N A321728 Number of integer partitions of n whose Young diagram cannot be partitioned into vertical sections of the same sizes as the parts of the original partition.
%C A321728 First differs from A000701 at a(11) = 28, A000701(11) = 27
%C A321728 A vertical section is a partial Young diagram with at most one square in each row.
%C A321728 Conjecture: a(n) is the number of non-half-loop-graphical partitions of n. An integer partition is half-loop-graphical if it comprises the multiset of vertex-degrees of some graph with half-loops, where a half-loop is an edge with one vertex, to be distinguished from a full loop, which has two equal vertices.

%F A321728 a(n) is the number of integer partitions y of n such that the coefficient of m(y) in e(y) is zero, where m is monomial and e is elementary symmetric functions.
%F A321728 a(n) = A000041(n) - A321729(n).
%e A321728 The a(2) = 1 through a(9) = 14 partitions whose Young diagram cannot be partitioned into vertical sections of the same sizes as the parts of the original partition are the same as the non-half-loop-graphical partitions up to n = 9:

%e A321728 For example, a complete list of all half/full-loop-graphs with degrees y = (4,3,1) is the following:
%e A321728   {{1,1},{1,2},{1,3},{2,2}}
%e A321728   {{1},{2},{1,1},{1,2},{2,3}}
%e A321728   {{1},{2},{1,1},{1,3},{2,2}}
%e A321728   {{1},{3},{1,1},{1,2},{2,2}}
%e A321728 None of these is a half-loop-graph, as they have full loops (x,x), so y is counted under a(8).
