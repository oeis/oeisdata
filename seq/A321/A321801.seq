%N A321801 Delete all consecutive identical decimal digits of n; write 0 if all digits disappear.
%C A321801 Consecutive identical digits of n are erased. Leading zeros are erased unless the result is 0. If all digits are erased, we write 0 for the result (A321802 is another version, which uses -1 for the empty string).
%C A321801 More than the usual number of terms are shown in order to reach some interesting examples. Agrees with A320486 for n < 101.
%e A321801 12311 becomes 123, 1123 becomes 23, 11231 becomes 231, and 110232 becomes 232 (as we don't accept leading zeros). Note that 112233 disappears immediately and we get 0.
%e A321801 1110, 11000, 1100011 all become 0.
