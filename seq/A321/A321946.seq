%N A321946 Number of divisors for the automorphism group size having the largest number of divisors for a binary self-dual code of length 2n.
%C A321946 A code is usually represented by a generating matrix. The row space of the generating matrix is the code itself.
%C A321946 Self-dual codes are codes such all codewords are pairwise orthogonal to each other.
%C A321946 Two codes are called permutation equivalent if one code can be obtained by permuting the coordinates (columns) of the other code.
%C A321946 The automorphism group of a code is the set of permutations of the coordinates (columns) that result in the same identical code.
%C A321946 The values in the sequence are not calculated lower bounds. For each n there exists a binary self-dual code of length 2n with an automorphism group of size a(n).
%C A321946 Binary self-dual codes have been classified (accounted for) up to a certain length. The classification process requires the automorphism group size be known for each code. There is a mass formula to calculate the number of distinct binary self-dual codes of a given length. Sequence A028362gives this count. The automorphism group size allows researchers to calculate the number of codes that are permutationally equivalent to a code. Each new binary self-dual code C of length m that is discovered will account for m!/aut(C) codes in the total number calculated by the mass formula. Aut(C) represents the automorphism size of the code C. Sequence A003179 gives number of binary self-dual codes up to permutation equivalence.
%C A321946 The values in the sequence are not calculated by a formula or algorithm.  They are the result of calculating the number of divisors for every automorphism group of every binary self-dual code.
%C A321946 The number of divisors a(n) does count 1 and the number itself.
%C A321946 In general the automorphism group size with the largest number of divisors is not unique.
%C A321946 In general the automorphism group size with the largest number of divisors is not the largest group automorphism group size for a given binary self-dual code length.

%e A321946 There is one binary self-dual code of length 2*14=28 having an automorphism group size of 1428329123020800.  This number has a(14) = 5616 divisors (including 1 and 1428329123020800).  The automorphism size of 1428329123020800 represents the automorphism size with the largest number of divisors for a binary self-dual code of length 2*14=28.
