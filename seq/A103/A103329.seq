%N A103329 Numbers m such that (1+i)^m - i is a Gaussian prime.
%C A103329 Note that A027206 and A057429 treat Gaussian primes of a similar form. The remaining case, (1+i)^m + 1, is a Gaussian prime for m=1,2,3,4 only.
%C A103329 Let z = (1+i)^m - i. If z is not pure real or pure imaginary, then z is a Gaussian prime if the product of z and its conjugate is a rational prime. That product is 1 + 2^m - sin(m*Pi/4)*2^(1+m/2). z is real when m=1. z is imaginary when m=4*k+2, in which case, z has magnitude 2^(2*k+1) - (-1)^k. These pure imaginary numbers are Gaussian primes when 2^(2*k+1)-1 is a Mersenne prime and 2*k+1 == 3 (mod 4); that is, when m is twice an odd number in A112634. - _T. D. Noe_, Mar 07 2011
