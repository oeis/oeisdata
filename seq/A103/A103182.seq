%N A103182 Sliding numbers: totals, including repetitions, of sums r + s, r >= s, such that 1/r + 1/s = (r + s)/10^k for some k >= 0.
%C A103182 The matching values of k are given by A103183.
%C A103182 Note that 1/20 + 1/50 = 0.070 --> 70 is a "sliding number" though 0.070 is usually written as 0.07. So any "sliding number" G produces an infinite chain of others: G*10, G*100, G*1000, etc. The first number in such a chain is called "primitive". [Note the sequence is not defined by way of decimal digits. The power-of-10 relationship merely makes it practical to illustrate examples using decimal fractions. - _Peter Munn_, Nov 29 2022]
%C A103182 Another characterization of the sliding numbers is numbers of the form j + 10^k/j where j | 10^k (k >= 0). - _David W. Wilson_, Mar 09 2005
%C A103182 In the definition 1/r + 1/s is (r+s)/(r*s) and we can cancel out (r+s), so we are looking for all (r+s) with r and s positive integers, such that r*s is a (nonnegative integral) power of 10, sorted by (r+s). It follows, for example, that for a given k, the smallest (r+s) that is a solution is at least 2*sqrt(10^k) (equality when k is even, unless we also require r != s). - _Christopher Landauer_, Mar 10 2005
%C A103182 Equivalently, the terms are numbers with a partition into 2 integers whose product is a power of 10. - _Peter Munn_, Nov 28 2022

%e A103182 1/4 + 1/25 = 0.29 --> 29 is a "sliding number"
%e A103182 1/8 + 1/125 = 0.133 --> 133 is a "sliding number"
%e A103182 1/2 + 1/5 = 0.7 --> 7 is a "sliding number"

%e A103182 Terms are repeated if they can be represented in different ways, for example:
%e A103182 205 = 5 + 200; 5 * 200 = 1000 (so 1/5 + 1/200 = 205/1000)
%e A103182     = 80 + 125; 80 * 125 = 10000 (so 1/80 + 1/125 = 205/10000).
