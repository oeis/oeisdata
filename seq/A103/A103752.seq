%N A103752 Erroneous version of: Primes from merging of 10 successive digits in decimal expansion of the Golden Ratio: (1+sqrt(5))/2.
%C A103752 What is this sequence? The correct version is A198177. - _Bruno Berselli_, May 01 2013
%C A103752 All terms are less than 2^31, this seems to indicate that the author made calculations with signed 32-bit integers, similar to A105383. But in contrast to that sequence, none of the terms here is obtained by using this procedure (taking mod 2^32 and selecting primes between 10^9 and 2^31). Does the present sequence rather relate to a different constant? - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 01 2014
