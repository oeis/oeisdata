%N A103247 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the coefficient of x^k (0<=k<=n) in the monic characteristic polynomial of the n X n matrix with 3's on the diagonal and 1's elsewhere (n>=1). Row 0 consists of the single term 1.
%C A103247 Row sums of the unsigned triangle yield A006234. The unsigned triangle is the mirror image of A103407.
%F A103247 Appears to be the matrix product (I-S)*P^(-2), where I is the identity, P is Pascal's triangle A007318 and S is A132440, the infinitesimal generator of P. Cf. A055137 (= (I-S)*P) and A103283 (= (I-S)*P^(-1)). - _Peter Bala_, Nov 28 2011
%e A103247 The monic characteristic polynomial of the matrix [3 1 1 / 1 3 1 / 1 1 3] is x^3 - 9x^2 + 24x - 20; so T(3,0)=-20, T(3,1)=24, T(3,2)=-9, T(3,3)=1.
