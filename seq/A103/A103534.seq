%N A103534 Concatenations of pairs of primes that differ by 1000.
%C A103534 Integers in this sequence can never be prime, as they are all multiples of 3. They can be semiprimes, as with the values for which the smaller prime P is prime(i) for i = 25, 36, 63, 93, 127...
%F A103534 a(n) = Concatenate(P, P+1000) iff P prime and P+1000 prime.
%e A103534 1811181 is in this sequence because 181 is prime, 181+1000 = 1181 is prime and those two primes are concatenated. The result is not itself a prime, as 1811181 = 3 x 23 x 26249. But it does happen to read the same backwards (palindromatic) and upside-down.
