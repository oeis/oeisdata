%N A325008 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of oriented colorings of the facets of a regular n-dimensional orthotope using exactly k colors. Row n has 2n columns.
%C A325008 Also called hypercube, n-dimensional cube, and measure polytope. For n=1, the figure is a line segment with two vertices. For n=2 the figure is a square with four edges. For n=3 the figure is a cube with six square faces. For n=4, the figure is a tesseract with eight cubic facets. The Schläfli symbol, {4,3,...,3}, of the regular n-dimensional orthotope (n>1) consists of a four followed by n-2 threes. Each of its 2n facets is an (n-1)-dimensional orthotope. Two oriented colorings are the same if one is a rotation of the other; chiral pairs are counted as two.
%C A325008 Also the number of oriented colorings of the vertices of a regular n-dimensional orthoplex using exactly k colors.
