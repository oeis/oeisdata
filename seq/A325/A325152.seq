%N A325152 Numbers whose squares can be expressed as the product of a number and its reversal.
%C A325152 The corresponding squares are in A325148 and the numbers k such that k * rev(k) is a square are in A306273.
%C A325152 The squares of the first 47 terms of this sequence (from 0 to 242) can be expressed as the product of a number and its reversal in only one way; then a(48) = 252 and 252^2 = 252 * 252 = 144 * 441.
%C A325152 The first 65 terms of this sequence (from 0 to 400) are exactly the first 65 terms of A061917; then a(66) = 403, non-palindrome, is the first term of the sequence A325151.
%F A325152 a(n) = sqrt(A325148(n)).
%e A325152 One way: 20^2 = 400 = 200 * 2.
%e A325152 Two ways: 2772^2 = 7683984 = 2772 * 2772 = 1584 * 4851.
%e A325152 Three ways: 2520^2 = 14400 * 441 = 25200 * 252 = 44100 * 144.
%e A325152 403 is a member since 403^2 = 162409 = 169*961 (note that 403 is not a member of A281625).
%Y A325152 Cf. A325148, A325149, A083408, A325150, A307019.
%Y A325152 Cf. also A061917, A325151.
%Y A325152 Similar to but different from A281625.
