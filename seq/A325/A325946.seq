%N A325946 Maximum number of intercardinal adjacencies among all n-celled polyplets.
%C A325946 A123663 provides the maximum number of cardinal adjacencies among n-celled polyominoes. The sequence under consideration here provides the maximum number of intercardinal (edge-to-edge and vertex-to-vertex) adjacencies among all n-celled polyplets.
%C A325946 Both A123663 and this sequence are used by landscape ecologists and geographic information system (GIS) professionals to determine quantitative measures over time of landscape erosion in high density coastal areas.
%C A325946 For initial terms n <= 20, M_O(n) is known to be optimal; for n > 20, the optimality of M_O(n) is probable. - _Nicholas P. Taliceo_, Jul 12 2021

%F A325946 By empirical observation a split-rule formula with 15 conditions generates the sequence M = 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 11, ... correctly for small n - this includes comparison with configurations known to be optimal (n < 20) and with computer generated searches for optimal configurations (n < 500):

%F A325946 This split-rule formula is derived geometrically using an approach described in the Example section.
%F A325946 Subsequently we have proved that M_O can be represented analytically by a single expression: M_O(n) = 4n-ceiling(sqrt(28n-12)).
%F A325946 We have proved the important estimate M_O(n) <= M(n) <= 2*(2n-2*ceiling(sqrt(n))) where 2n-2*ceiling(sqrt(n)) is A123663. This upper bound is not sharp for small n. The relative difference between M_O(n) and 2*(2n-2*ceiling(sqrt(n))) is less than 3% for at least 145 <= n <= 10^7 tiles and the relative difference goes to zero. For practical uses like GIS, our formula will have very small relative error if, in fact, it does not describe the sequence exactly.
%e A325946 For n = 12, the optimal configuration is a "regular octagon" of side length two (i.e., the symmetric, cross-shaped configuration with rows of length 2, 4, 4, and 2). This yields 30 intercardinal adjacencies.
%e A325946 In general, when n = 7p^2 - 10p + 4 the n tiles can be arranged into the shape of a regular octagon with side length p and 28p^2 - 54p + 26 intercardinal adjacencies. We conjecture these are optimal.
%e A325946 Moreover, we believe all of the intermediary cases are generated by a family of archetypes where one moves from a regular octagon to a "stretched octagon" to a "small corners octagon" and then to the next largest regular octagon. This geometric approach gives rise to the split rule formula described above.
