%N A325058 Starts of runs of 7 consecutive exponentially odd numbers (A268335).
%C A325058 The maximal run of consecutive exponentially odd numbers is of length 7 since numbers of the form 8k + 4 are not exponentially odd. Thus all the terms of this sequence are of the form 8k + 5 with k = 3, 4, 6, 12, 16, 22, 26, 46, 56, 63, 67, 76, 84, 94, ...
%C A325058 The number of terms below 10^k for k = 2, 3, ... is 3, 18, 201, 1878, 18902, 189515, 1895392, 18954089, ... Apparently this sequence has an asymptotic density of 0.01895...
