%N A316945 A triple of positive integers (n,p,k) is admissible if there exist at least two different multisets of k positive integers, {x_1,x_2,...,x_k} and {y_1,y_2,...,y_k}, such that x_1+x_2+...+x_k=y_1+y_2+...+y_k = n and x_1x_2...x_k = y_1y_2...y_k = p. For each n, let A(n)={k:(n,p,k) is admissible for some p}, and let a(n) = |A(n)|.
%C A316945 John Conway proposed an interesting math puzzle in the 1960s, which is now generally known as "Conway's wizard problem." Here is the problem.
%C A316945 Last night I sat behind two wizards on a bus and overheard the following:
%C A316945 Blue Wizard: I have a positive integer number of children, whose ages are positive integers. The sum of their ages is the number of this bus, while the product is my own age.
%C A316945 Red Wizard: How interesting! Perhaps if you told me your age and the number of your children, I could work out their individual ages?
%C A316945 Blue Wizard: No, you could not.
%C A316945 Red Wizard: Aha! At last, I know how old you are!
%C A316945 Apparently the Red Wizard had been trying to determine the Blue Wizard's age for some time. Now, what was the number of the bus?
%C A316945 This problem posed by Conway looks at different multisets that correspond to the same ordered triple, which motivated the study of this sequence.

%F A316945 a(n) = 0 for 1 <= n <= 11, a(12) = 1, a(13) = 2, a(14) = 4, a(15) = 4, a(16) = 6, a(17) = 7, a(18) = 7, and a(n) = n - 10 for n >= 19.
%e A316945 For n = 3, the only partitions of 3 are {3}, {1,2}, and {1,1,1}. Hence, there is no admissible triple (3,p,k).
%e A316945 For n = 4, the only partitions of 4 are {4}, {1,3}, {2,2},{1,1,2}, and {1,1,1,1}. Hence, there is no admissible triple (4,p,k).
%e A316945 For n = 12, the only admissible triple (12,p,k) is when p = 48 and k = 4. This is achieved by the following multisets: {1,3,4,4} and {2,2,2,6}. Thus a(12) = 1.
