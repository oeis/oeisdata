%N A362202 Lexicographic earliest sequence of distinct positive integers having the same concatenation of digits as the sequence 2^a(n).
%C A362202 We conjecture that this is a permutation of the positive integers, but a proof seems without reach. Can it be disproved?
%C A362202 The sequence greedily extends to infinity, i.e., without backtracking, always choosing a(n) as the smallest possible term compatible with the digits given so far, and not leaving a 0 as next digit to be the initial digit of a future term a(n') or 2^a(n').
%e A362202 The first term a(1) must start with the same digits as 2^a(1), the smallest solution is a(1) = 6 with 2^a(1) = 64.
%e A362202 Then the next digit must be 4, and we can indeed choose a(2) = 4 with 2^a(2) = 16.
%e A362202 Then the next digit must be 1, and we can indeed choose a(3) = 1 with 2^a(3) = 2.
%e A362202 Then the next digit must be 6 (last digit of 2^a(2)), but since 6 = a(1) is already used, we have to consider a(4) with at least two digits, the second of which must be 2 from 2^a(3). We can indeed choose a(4) = 62 with 2^a(4) = 4611686018427387904.
%e A362202 Then the next digits must be 4 and 6 from 2^a(4). Since 4 = a(2) is already used, we must choose a(5) = 46 with 2^a(5) = 70368744177664.
%e A362202 After a(13), the next digits must be 7, 9, and 0. Although 79 is not used earlier, we can't take a(14) = 79, since this would require the next term to start with a digit 0, which is impossible. Therefore, a(14) = 790.
