%N A362815 Start with 2. Then, numbers are added to the sequence if they do not form any arithmetic progression p with numbers in the sequence such that length(p) > min(p).
%C A362815 All primes are in the sequence.
%C A362815 Does the density of numbers in this sequence approach 0.5?

%e A362815 2 is in the sequence.
%e A362815 For 3: the only arithmetic progression made with 3 is p = {2,3}. Here, length(p) = min(p), so 3 is a term.
%e A362815 For 4: p = {2,3,4} can be made. Here, length(p) > min(p), so 4 is not a term.
%e A362815 For 5: the only arithmetic progressions made with 5 are p = {2,5} and p = {3,5}. Neither of these have length(p) > min(p), so 5 is a term.
%e A362815 ...
%e A362815 For 9: p = {3,5,7,9} can be made. Here, length(p) > min(p), so 9 is not a term.
