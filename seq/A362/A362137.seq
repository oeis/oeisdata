%N A362137 Smallest size of an n-paradoxical tournament built as a directed Paley graph.
%C A362137 An n-paradoxical tournament consists of a complete oriented 1-graph (each pair of vertices are connected by exactly one directed edge) in which all possible groups of n vertices have a common predecessor.
%C A362137 A Paley graph is constructed from the members of a finite field F by connecting pairs of elements that differ by a quadratic residue.
%C A362137 In an n-paradoxical tournament built as a directed Paley graph, a vertex x is the predecessor of a vertex y if and only if y-x is a quadratic residue of F.
%C A362137 a(0)=1, a(1)=3, a(2)=7 and a(3)=19 are proved to be the smallest sizes of an n-paradoxical tournament. The following a(4)=67, a(5)=331 and a(6)=1263 are only the smallest sizes of the known solutions for an n-paradoxical tournament but they are the smallest sizes of an n-paradoxical tournament built as a directed Paley graph.
%C A362137 All known smallest sizes of an n-paradoxical tournament are primes congruent to 3 mod 4.
%C A362137 No reasonable values of a(n) for n > 6 are known.
%C A362137 Lower and upper bounds are given in the papers given in the references section.
