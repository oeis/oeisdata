%N A362265 Indices m for which A362363(m) = 0, meaning the large spiral point in A362249 falls on the East base spiral.
%C A362265 If m is a term then further terms can be found by writing m = s^2 + r such that s^2 is the square closest to m (and r is positive or negative). Then further terms are k = (t*s)^2 + t*r for odd t (but only sometimes even t).
%H A362265 Thomas Scheuerle, <a href="/A362265/a362265.png">Spiral of dots.</a> Each dot corresponds to a spiral from A362249. If this spiral meets with spiral "E", the color is blue. Other colors: "S" = orange, "W" = yellow, "N" = violet. Spirals where n in A362249 is an even square number are located on the x axis extending from the midpoint to the right. The odd square numbers extend to the left.
%F A362265 All numbers of the form (2*k+1)^2 will be found inside this sequence but not (2*k)^2.
%F A362265 All numbers of the form 4^k+2^k, 4*k^2+k and k > 0, 9*(2*k+1)^2-4*k-2, 9*k^2+3*k and k > 0, 16*(2*k+1)^2+2*k+1 will be found inside this sequence.
%e A362265 6 is a term since in A362249, its n=6 large spiral point 6 falls on its East base spiral.
%Y A362265 Cf. A362249, A000290, A001844, A002061.
