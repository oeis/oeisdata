%N A362867 Irregular triangle read by rows; the n-th row is the n-th permutation of 0 to infinity, in reversed colexicographic ordering, terminating when the rest of the row equals k.
%C A362867 Every row of this triangle represents a number which is normal in base b >= 2. Since there are infinitely many bases, every row represents a set of infinitely many numbers, each of which is normal in at least one base.
%C A362867 Treating A(n,k) as equal to k when k is greater than A084558(n) (A084558(n) is the length of the n-th row minus one), for any base b >= 2, the concatenation of the base-b expansion of the n-th row is normal in base b. In other words, for any n >= 0 and b >= 2, C(n,b) is normal in base b.
%C A362867 C(n,b) = Sum_{k >= 0} A(n,k)/(b^(Sum_{m=0..k} ceiling(log_b(A(n,m)+1))))
%C A362867 (The equation for Champernowne's constants using the n-th row of this triangle rather than 0,1,2,...)
%C A362867 C(0,b) is Champernowne's constant for base b (C_b).
%C A362867 Even though for any b and m >= 2, b != m, C(n,b) != C(n,m), it is possible for C(n,b) = C(m,p) where n != m and b != p. In such a case, C(n,b) is normal in two different bases. m will likely be significantly larger than n and p will likely be a power of b.
