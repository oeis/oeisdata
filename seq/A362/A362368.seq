%N A362368 Number of binary strings of length n which are losing configurations in the palindrome game.
%C A362368 The palindrome game is a game where players take turns removing a nonempty palindrome from a binary string. The player who crosses off the last palindrome wins. The nonempty palindrome can be removed from anywhere in the current string.
%e A362368 For n = 2, 10 and 01 are losing strings since the first player has to cross out either the first or second character, leaving the second player with a string of length 1, which is always a palindrome. 00 and 11 are not losing strings since the first player can cross out the entire string and win.
%e A362368 For n = 4, the four losing positions are 0011, 0101, 1010, 1100.
%e A362368 For n = 5, 00101 is winning since the first player may put the second in a losing position by removing 010 from the center or by removing either of the first two 0's.
