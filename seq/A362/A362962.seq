%N A362962 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive terms such that if a(n) jumps over a(n) positions towards the right (landing on the integer k), the sum a(n) + k is always prime.
%C A362962 a(n) - a(n+k) = k with k odd is forbidden as this would lead to a contradiction. This is why a(4) = 5 here and not a(4) = 3.
%C A362962 The sequence is a permutation of the natural numbers.
%e A362962   S = 1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 8, 11, 12, 13, ...
