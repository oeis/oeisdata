%N A362782 a(n) is the smallest number k whose symmetric representation of sigma(k) shares sections of its border with those of n other numbers.
%C A362782 The values of the first 6 numbers in this sequence can be read off from the illustration of the symmetric representations of sigma, SRS, in A237593.
%C A362782 SRS(a(5)) = SRS(12) consists of 1 part. It has SRS(10) and SRS(15) as its farthest ones with shared border sections, neither one consists of a single part.
%C A362782 SRS(a(18)) = SRS(2530) consists of 2 parts while its farthest shared border sections are with SRS(2520) and SRS(2538) both of which consist of a single part.
%e A362782 a(4) = 6 since the borders of SRS(4) and SRS(5) below and SRS(7) and SRS(8) above share border sections with SRS(6).
%e A362782 a(5) = 12 since the borders of SRS(10) and SRS(11) below and SRS(13), SRS(14) and SRS(15) above share border sections with SRS(12). SRS(9) is not included since it only shares one vertex (on the diagonal) with SRS(12).
