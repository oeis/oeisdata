%N A362027 Squares visited by a knight moving on a square-spiral numbered board where the knight moves to a previously unvisited square with a number as close as possible to the number of the current square. If two such squares exist the smaller numbered square is chosen.
%C A362027 This sequence is finite: after 130 squares have been visited the square with number 50 is reached after which all eight neighboring squares the knight could move to have already been visited. See the linked image. The largest visited square is a(117) = 247 while the smallest unvisited square is 20.

%e A362027 a(6) = 12 as after the knight moves to the square containing 9 the available unvisited squares are 4, 12, 22, 26, 28, 46, 48. Of these 12, where |12 - 9| = 3, is the closest number to 9. This is the first term to differ from A316667.
