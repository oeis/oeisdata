%N A362552 a(n) = n for n <= 2. For n > 2, a(n) is the least novel k (with rad(k) != rad(a(n-1))) such that k shares a nontrivial divisor with one of a(n-1), a(n-2), but not with the other.
%C A362552 The sequence definition is related to those of A098550 and A336957 in the sense that the next term a(n) is chosen according to whichever of the two criteria delivers the least unused number, subject to the rad condition.
%C A362552 The rule that rad(k) != rad(a(n-1)) is necessary to ensure that the next term always exists (see Example).
%C A362552 Odd primes p appear as 2*p, p, u where u is the least unused even term.
%C A362552 Conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers in which the primes appear in natural order.

%e A362552 With a(1) = 1 and a(2) = 2, the least k prime to 1 but not to 2 would be 4, but this will not work because rad(2) = rad(4), preventing selection of the next term a(4). Therefore a(3) is 6, which is prime to 1 but not to 2. The next term, a(4) is 3, the smallest number prime to 2 but not to 6. a(5) cannot be 9 because rad(3) = rad(9) but 4 fits, being prime to 3 but not to 6; and so on.
