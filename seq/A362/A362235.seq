%N A362235 Number of edges among all distinct circles that can be constructed from a point on the origin and n equally spaced points on each of the +x,-x,+y,-y coordinates axes when each pair of points is connected by a circle and where the points lie at the ends of the circles' diameter.
%C A362235 A circle is constructed for every pair of the 1 + 4n points, the two points lying at the ends of a diameter of the circle. The number of distinct circles constructed from the points is A139275(n).
%C A362235 No formula for a(n) is currently known.
%C A362235 See A362233 and A362234 for images of the circles.
%F A362235 a(n) = A362234(n) + A362233(n) - 1 by Euler's formula.
%Y A362235 Cf. A362233 (vertices), A362234 (regions), A362236 (k-gons), A139275 (distinct circles), A356358, A359934.
