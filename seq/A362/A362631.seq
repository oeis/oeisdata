%N A362631 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of distinct positive integers with a(n) = n for n <= 3, and for n > 3  a(n) is the least novel multiple of the greatest prime divisor of a(n-2) which does not divide a(n-1).
%C A362631 The definition reflects that of A098550 in that it places a condition on a(n-2) which does not apply to a(n-1).
%C A362631 If there is no prime divisor of a(n-2) which does not divide a(n-1), then by empty product convention a(n) = u the least unused number.
%C A362631 Some primes (23,29,31,47,...) enter because of dividing a(n-2) but not a(n-1), whereas others (5,7,11,13,17,19,...) enter as least u; see Example.
%C A362631 With the exception of 16 all least u terms (up to a(2^28)) are primes, so it seems likely that a(47) = 16 is a one-off (fluke) term.
%C A362631 The scatterplot resembles a fine-toothed comb similar to those of A361629, A361133 and A361534, in which each "tooth" starts with a novel prime p and continues with a run of (mostly) alternate multiples of p and the greatest prime less than p until interrupted by the arrival of the next prime, and so forth.
%C A362631 The sequence, after a(1) = 1 can be represented as an irregular table in which the n-th row starts with prime(n), see Example.
%C A362631 Conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers with the primes in order.

We accentuate powerful numbers that are not prime powers in light blue.
%e A362631 a(4,5) = 4, 6 and since rad(4)|rad(6) a(6) = least u = 5.
%e A362631 a(11,12) = 8, 20 and since rad(8)|rad(20) a(13) = least u = 7.
%e A362631 a(44,45) = 132, 13 and gpf(132) = 11 does not divide 13, and since it is the 13th occurrence of p = 11, a(46) = 13*11 = 143.
%e A362631 a(45,46) = 13, 143 which forces a(47) = least u = 16 (see Comment).
%e A362631 a(90,91) = 69, 114 and 23 is the greatest prime dividing 69 which does not divide 114. Since 23 has not appeared earlier in the sequence a(92) = 23.
%e A362631 There is as yet no known formula for the row lengths of the table below. Whereas most rows terminate with a multiple of the prime they start with, there are exceptions, e.g., 47, 109. This behavior is open to explanation.
