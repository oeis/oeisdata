%e A362786 For n=7 we have one 3-node path and two 2-node paths. Call two paths adjacent if we can choose one node from each path so that the two nodes are adjacent vertices of the n-gon. Then either each pair of paths is adjacent, or the two 2-node paths are not adjacent, or a 2-node path is not adjacent to the 3-node path. In each of these three cases there are 7 choices for the set of nodes for the 3-node path and 3 ways to connect them, and then the 2-node paths are uniquely determined. Thus a(7) = 3*7*3 = 63.
