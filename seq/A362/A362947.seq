%N A362947 a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0; for n > 1, a(n) is the number of pairs of consecutive terms whose product has same value as a(n-2) * a(n-1).
%C A362947 Similarly to A364027 the same number cannot occur four times in a row. In the first 10 million terms three consecutive equal numbers occurs twenty-three times, the last such triplet being a(8247993)..a(8247995) = 59. It is likely such triplets occur infinitely often although this is unknown.

%e A362947 a(2) = 1 as there is one pair whose product equals a(0) * a(1) = 0, namely a(0) * a(1).
%e A362947 a(3) = 2 as a(1) * a(2) = 0 * 1 = 0, and there has been two previous pairs whose product is 0, namely a(0) * a(1) and a(1) * a(2).
%e A362947 a(11) = 4 as a(9) * a(10) = 1 * 2 = 2, and there has been four previous pairs whose product is 2, namely a(2) * a(3), a(3) * a(4), a(4) * a(5) and a(9) * a(10).
