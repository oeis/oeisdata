%N A362881 a(n) is the length of the longest arithmetic progression ending at a(n-1); a(1)=1.
%C A362881 Progressions are terms at indices which are in arithmetic progression and with values which are in arithmetic progression too.
%C A362881 In the first 10^6 terms, no 2's occur after a(60) and no 3's occur after a(2746). Can it be proved that no more will occur after these values? For any k in the sequence, is there a term where k occurs for the final time?
%C A362881 This sequence is unbounded (this is a consequence of Van der Waerden's theorem). - _Rémy Sigrist_, May 14 2023

%e A362881 For n = 13, the longest arithmetic progression ending at a(12) is {a(4), a(8), a(12)} = {2, 3, 4}, which has length 3, so a(13) = 3.
%e A362881 For n = 28, the longest arithmetic progression ending at a(27) is {a(15), a(18), a(21), a(24), a(27)} = {3, 3, 3, 3, 3}, which has length 5, so a(28) = 5.
