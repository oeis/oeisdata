%N A362287 Hypertotient numbers: numbers k such that the set that includes k and the numbers less than k and relatively prime to k can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets of equal sum.
%C A362287 With the exception of 10 and 30, these are numbers k such that k*(phi(k)+2) is divisible by 4, where phi is the Euler totient function (A000010).
