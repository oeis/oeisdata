%N A362939 a(n) = minimum number of pieces needed to dissect a regular n-sided polygon into a rectangle (conjectured).
%C A362939 The dimensions of the rectangle can be anything you want, as long as it is a rectangle.
%C A362939 Turning over is allowed. The pieces must be bounded by simple curves to avoid difficulties with non-measurable sets.
%C A362939 Apart from changing "square" to "rectangle", the rules are the same as in A110312.
%C A362939 I do not know which of these values have been proved to be minimal. Probably only a(3)=2 and a(4)=1.
%C A362939 The three related sequences A110312, A362938, A362939 are exceptions to the usual OEIS policy of requiring that all terms in sequences must be known exactly. These sequences are included because of their importance and in the hope that someone will establish the truth of some of the conjectured values.
%C A362939 The definitions imply that A362938(n) <= a(n) <= A110312(n).
