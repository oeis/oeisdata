%N A044050 a(n) = "length" of the aliquot sequence for n.
%C A044050 The aliquot sequence for n is the trajectory of n under repeated application of the map A001065 = x -> sigma(x) - x.
%C A044050 The trajectory will either have a transient part followed by a cyclic part, or have an infinite transient part and never cycle.
%C A044050 Sequence gives (length of transient part of trajectory) + (length of cycle if the trajectory did not reach 0). In other words, here we consider that the trajectory ends if we reach 1.
%C A044050 Given that A001065(n) is the sum of the divisors of n which are less than n, we have that the aliquot length A(n) = r-1 where r is the smallest integer such that A001065^r(n) = A001065^s(n) for some s<r. If this never happens (i.e., if r is infinite) then we set a(n) = 0. [Edited by _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 16 2013]
%C A044050 In the interval [1,1000] it is not known if the aliquot length is 0 for the numbers 276, 552, 564, 660 and 966.
%C A044050 The function sigma = A000203 (and thus A001065 = sigma - id) is defined only on the positive integers and not for 0, so the trajectory ends when 0 is reached. - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 16 2013

%e A044050 a(12) = 7:
%e A044050 12 is divisible by 1,2,3,4 and 6 so sigma(12)=16;
%e A044050 16 is divisible by 1,2,4 and 8 so sigma(16)=15;
%e A044050 15 is divisible by 1,3 and 5 so sigma(15)=9;
%e A044050 9 is divisible by 1 and 3 so sigma(9)=4;
%e A044050 4 is divisible by 1 and 2 so sigma(4)=3;
%e A044050 3 is divisible only by 1 so sigma(3)=1;
%e A044050 1 is not divisible by anything less than 1 so sigma(1)=0.
%e A044050 The aliquot sequence is therefore 16, 15, 9, 4, 3, 1, 0 which is 7 elements long. Therefore a(12) = 7.
