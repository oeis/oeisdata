%N A044851 Positive integers having no fewer base-10 runs of even length than odd.
%C A044851 Starts to differ from A033283 first for the numbers 1011 and 1022 which have 1 run of even length, 2 runs of odd length and maximum run length of 2. So these two numbers are in A033283 but not in this sequence. [From _R. J. Mathar_, Oct 20 2008]
