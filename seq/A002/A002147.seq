%N A002147 Largest prime == 7 (mod 8) with class number 2n+1.
%C A002147 Apr 14 2008: _David Broadhurst_ says: I computed class numbers for prime discriminants with |D| < 10^9, but stopped when the first case with |D| > 5*10^8 was observed. That factor of 2 seems to me to be a reasonable margin of error, when you look at the pattern of what is included.
