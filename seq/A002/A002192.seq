%N A002192 Least integer with A000203(a(n)) = A002191(n), where A002191 = range of the sum-of-divisors function A000203.
%C A002192 This is the least integer with the increasing sigma value A002191(n). For integers sorted on the ordered sigma values A007609(n), see A085790. - _Lekraj Beedassy_, Oct 08 2004
%C A002192 The sigma function (A000203) can't have a left nor a right inverse since it is neither injective nor surjective. The first column of the table A085790 (undefined when the row length A054973(n) = 0 <=> no x has sigma(x) = n) or A051444 (which has zeros filled in for these undefined values) are right-inverse of sigma on A002191 = range of sigma: one has A000203(A051444(n)) = A000203(A085790(n,1)) = n for all n in A002191 <=> A054973(n) > 0 <=> row A085790(n,.) nonempty <=> there is x with sigma(x) = n. Since sigma(6) = sigma(11) = 12, a hypothetical left inverse g must satisfy g(12) = 6 and g(12) = 11 which is impossible. Restricted to this list A002192 of smallest indices for the possible values of sigma, there exists a left inverse g such that g(sigma(x)) = x for all x in A002192. This equation defines the function g, i.e., g(A002191(n)) := a(n). A different left inverse exists on the set of largest pre-images for the possible values of sigma, {A085790(n,A054973(n)); n in A002191} = {1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 11, 9, 13, 8, 17, 19, 23, 12, 29, 25, 31, 22, 37, 18, 27, 41, 43, ...}. - _M.
