%N A002873 The maximal number of partitions of {1..2n} that are invariant under a permutation consisting of n 2-cycles, and which have the same number of nonempty parts.
%C A002873 Previous name was: Sorting numbers (see Motzkin article for details).
%C A002873 Since a(n) by definition is the largest among some positive integers, whose sum is A002872(n), we always have the relation a(n) <= A002872(n); and for n > 0 the inequality is strict, since then that sum consists of more than one term. - _Jörgen Backelin_, Jan 13 2016

%e A002873 There are three partitions of {1,2,3,4} into two (nonempty) parts, and which are invariant under the permutation (1,2)(3,4), namely {{1,2}, {3,4}}, {{1,3}, {2,4}}, and {{1,4}, {2,3}}. There are also one such partition with just one part, two with three parts, and one with four parts; but three is the largest of these amounts. Thus, a(2) = 3.
%e A002873 Similarly, there are ten (1,2)(3,4)(5,6) invariant partitions of {1,2,3,4,5,6} into three nonempty parts, and no larger amount into any other given number of parts, whence a(3) = 10.
