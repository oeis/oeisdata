%C A002904 From _M. F. Hasler_, Feb 21 2020: (Start)
%C A002904 There are several standards for Roman numerals, even though experts agree that none of them has ever been universally accepted, cf. references in Wikipedia article.
%C A002904 The current definition of the sequence uses "if possible", so whenever there is a possible interpretation according to any of these standards, it is acceptable.
%C A002904 Non-uniqueness could be caused by rare irregular variants which must be excluded in order to have a well-defined sequence. E.g., iixx will mean 18, not 22, although the standard notation for 18 is xviii (and xiix would also be used sometimes).
%C A002904 If required, the meaning of "possible" must be made more precise (e.g., allowing only "standard subtractive" or additionnally "standard additive" notation; this can be made completely explicit). (End)
%C A002904 There are 1411 nonzero terms; see Branicky link. - _Michael S. Branicky_, Jan 09 2023

%F A002904 a(100..999) = 0, due to "dd".
%F A002904 a(k*1000) = 500 for k in {1..4, 10, 14, 20..24, 40..44};
%F A002904 a(k*1000+i) = (500 + a(i))*[a(i) != 0] for i in 1..99 for k in {1..4, 10, 14, 20..24, 40..44}; and
%F A002904 a(n) = 0 for all other 1100 <= n <= 999999, due to "id", "vd", "xd" or "dd".
%F A002904 a(n) = 0 for n >= 10^6, due to "ll".
%F A002904 (End)
%e A002904 To get a(5), write 5 = "five", delete 'f' & 'e' to get "iv", Roman for 4 = a(5).
%e A002904 To get a(35), write 35 = "thirty five", delete all but 'i's and 'v's, to get "iiv", which is not a legal Roman number*, so a(35) = 0 by definition of the sequence. (*It is never allowed to subtract more than one unit 'I' (or 'X' or 'C') from one of the symbols V, L, D representing 5 times a power of 10, as it is never allowed that one of V, L, D is subtracted from one of I, X, C, M.)
