%N A189974 Numbers m such that d(m-1) = d(m+1) = 4, where d(k) is the number of divisors of k (A000005).
%C A189974 Numbers m such that m-1 and m+1 are both multiplicatively perfect numbers A007422.
%C A189974 Conjecture: all terms but the first two are even numbers. - _Harvey P. Dale_, Jul 21 2025
%C A189974 Proof of conjecture: if m is odd and > 10 then either m-1 or m+1 is divisible by 4 and > 8 as well. Let t be the number from {m-1, m+1} divisible by 4. Then t is a power of 2 that is > 8 and so has more than two divisors or it has an odd prime divisor such that it has more than 4 divisors. Both exclude the odd m > 8 from the sequence. - _David A.
