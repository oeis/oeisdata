%N A281319 Number of left Bol loops (including Moufang loops) of order n which are not groups.
%C A281319 A loop is a set L with binary operation (denoted simply by juxtaposition) such that for each a in L, the left (right) multiplication map L_a:=L->L, x->xa (R_a: L->L, x->ax) is bijective and L has a two-sided identity 1.  A loop is left Bol if it satisfies the left Bol identity (x.yx)z=x(y.xz) for all x,y,z in L. A loop is Moufang if it is both left Bol and right Bol.

%e A281319 a(8)=6 since there are 6 left Bol loops of order 8 and a(12)=3 since there are 3 left Bol loops of order 12 one of which is the smallest Moufang loop.

%E A281319 a(18) changed to 2 by _N. J. A. Sloane_, Feb 02 2023 at the suggestion of Kurosh Mavaddat Nezhaad, who said in an email that the number of Bol loops of order 18, and generally of order 2p^2 up to isomorphism, is exactly 2. See Sharma (1984) or Burn (1985).
