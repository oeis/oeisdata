%N A281352 Number of ways to write a nonnegative rational integer n as a sum of three squares in the ring of integers of Q(sqrt(3)).
%C A281352 a(n) is the number of solutions to the equation n = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 with x, y, z in the ring of integers Z[sqrt(3)] of Q(sqrt(3)).
%C A281352 This is the same as solving the system of equations
%C A281352   n = (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + 3*(d^2 + e^2 + f^2)
%C A281352   ad + be + cf = 0
%C A281352 in rational integers.
%C A281352 According to Cohn (1961), the class number of Q(sqrt(3), sqrt{-n}) always divides a(n).
%C A281352 Let O=Z[sqrt(3)] denote the ring of integers of Q(sqrt(3)). Note that the equation 7=x^2+y^2+z^2 has no solutions in integers, but has 48 solutions in O. For example, 7=1^2+(sqrt(3))^2+(sqrt(3))^2.
%C A281352 Let theta_3(q)=1+2q+2q^4+... be the 3rd Jacobi theta function. It is widely known that theta_3(q)^3 is the generating function for the number of rational integer solutions r_3(n) to n=x^2+y^2+z^2.
%C A281352 Is there a generating function for a(n)?
%C A281352 For which n is it true that r_3(n) divides a(n)?

%e A281352 a(0)=1, because the equation 0 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 has a single solution (x,y,z)=(0,0,0);
%e A281352 a(1)=6, because the only solutions are (x,y,z)=(+-1,0,0),(0,+-1,0),(0,0,+-1);
%e A281352 a(2)=12, because the only solutions are (x,y,z)=(+-1,+-1,0),(0,+-1,+-1),(+-1,0,+-1);
%e A281352 a(3)=14, because the only solutions are (x,y,z)=(+-1,+-1,+-1),(+-sqrt(3),0,0),(0,+-sqrt(3),0),(0,0,+-sqrt(3));
%e A281352 a(4)=30, etc.
