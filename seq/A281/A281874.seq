%N A281874 Number of Dyck paths of semilength n with distinct peak heights.
%C A281874 a(n) is the number of Dyck paths of length 2n with no two peaks at the same height. A peak is a UD, an up-step U=(1,1) immediately followed by a down-step D=(1,-1).
%C A281874 In the Mathematica recurrence below, a(n,k) is the number of Dyck paths of length 2n with all peaks at distinct heights except that there are k peaks at the maximum peak height. Thus a(n)=a(n,1). The recurrence is based on the following simple observation. Paths counted by a(n,k) are obtained from paths counted by a(n-k,i) for some i, 1<=i<=k+1, by inserting runs of one or more contiguous peaks at each of the existing peak vertices at the maximum peak height, except that (at most) one such existing peak may be left undisturbed, and so that a total of k new peaks are added.
%C A281874 It appears that lim a(n)/a(n-1) as n approaches infinity exists and is approximately 2.5659398.

%e A281874 a(3)=3 counts UUUDDD, UDUUDD, UUDDUD because the first has only one peak and the last two have peak heights 1,2 and 2,1 respectively.
