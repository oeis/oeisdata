%C A188533 All terms > a(4) = 14 must have all base 5 digits equal to 4 except for exactly one digit 3 which cannot be the initial digit. Indeed, numbers with only 4s in their base-5 expansion are of the form 5^n-1, n > 0, but since 5^n-1 == 1-1 == 0 (mod 4), the binary expansion of such numbers ends in '00'. If the exception is the first digit, we have a number of the form N = (d+1)*5^m-1, where 1 <= d <= 3 is the first digit and m is the number of subsequent digits 4, in base 5. But if d = 1, then N = 2*5^m-1 == 1 (mod 8), since 2*5^m == 2*(-3)^m == 2*(-3 or 1) == 2 (mod 8). That means, N's binary expansion ends in '001'. If d = 2, then N = 3*5^m-1 is even, so it ends in a bit 0, and N/2 has another bit 0 at position p = A001511(m+3)+1 = valuation(m+3, 2)+2 from the right (i.e., the binary digit with value 2^p). If d = 3, then N = 4*5^m-1 == 3 (mod 16), so its binary expansion ends in '0011'. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jun 28 2025
