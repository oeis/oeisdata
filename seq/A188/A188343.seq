%N A188343 Number of "ON" cells at n-th stage in simple 2-dimensional cellular automaton (see Comments for precise definition).
%C A188343 On the infinite square grid, we start at stage 0 with all square cells in the OFF state.
%C A188343 At stage 1 we turn ON a single cell in the central position.
%C A188343 For n>1, if n is even, at stage n we turn ON all the OFF neighboring cells from cells that were turned ON at stage n-1.
%C A188343 For n>1, if n is odd, at stage n we turn ON all the OFF cells that have exactly one neighbor that was turned ON at stage n-1.
%C A188343 First differs from A160118 at a(13).
%H A188343 Nathaniel Johnston, <a href="/A188343/a188343.png">13th generation of this sequence</a>, where it first differs from A160118. Cells in green were newly turned on in generation 13 and are also turned on in generation 13 of A160118. Cells in red are newly turned on but are not turned on in A160118.

%F A188343 For n even, use Generations rule "/12345678/250". For n odd, use Generations rule "/1/250".
%Y A188343 Cf. A160118.
