%N A188900 Number of compositions of n that avoid the pattern 12-3.
%C A188900 First differs from the non-dashed version A102726 at a(9) = 215, A102726(9) = 214, due to the composition (1,3,2,3).
%C A188900 The value a(11) = 7464 in Heubach et al. is a typo.
%C A188900 Theorem: A composition avoids 3-12 iff its leaders of maximal weakly decreasing runs are weakly increasing. For example, the composition q = (1,1,2,1,2,2,1,3) has maximal weakly decreasing runs ((1,1),(2,1),(2,2,1),(3)), with leaders (1,2,2,3), which are weakly increasing, so q is counted under a(13); also q avoids 3-12, as required. On the other hand, the composition q = (3,2,1,2,2,1,2) has maximal weakly decreasing runs ((3,2,1),(2,2,1),(2)), with leaders (3,2,2), which are not weakly increasing, so q is not counted under a(13); also q matches 3-12, as required. - _Gus Wiseman_, Aug 21 2024
