%N A188544 Decimal expansion of the angle B in the doubly e-ratio triangle ABC.
%C A188544 There is a unique (shape of) triangle ABC that is both side-e-ratio and angle-e-ratio. Its angles are B, t*B and pi-B-t*B, where t=e. "Side-e-ratio" and "angle-e-ratio" refer to partitionings of ABC, each in a manner that matches the continued fraction [2,1,2,1,1,4,1,1,6,...] of t.  For doubly golden and doubly silver triangles, see A152149 and A188543.  For the side partitioning and angle partitioning (i,e, constructions) which match arbitrary continued fractions (of sidelength ratios and angle ratios), see the 2007 reference.
