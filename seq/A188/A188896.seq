%N A188896 Numbers n such that there is no square n-gonal number greater than 1.
%C A188896 It is easy to find squares that are triangular, pentagonal, hexagonal, etc. So it is somewhat surprising that there are no square 10-gonal numbers other than 0 and 1. For these n, the equation 2*x^2 = (n-2)*y^2 - (n-4)*y has no integer solutions x>1 and y>1.
%C A188896 Chu shows how to transform the equation into a generalized Pell equation. When n has the form 2k^2+2 (A005893), then the Pell equation has only a finite number of solutions and it is simple to select the n that produce no integer solutions greater than 1.
%C A188896 The general case is in A188950.
