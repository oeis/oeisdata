%N A188640 Decimal expansion of e + sqrt(1+e^2).
%C A188640 The shape of a rectangle WXYZ, denoted by [WXYZ], is defined by length/width: [WXYZ]=max{|WX|/|YZ|, |YZ|/|WX|}.  Consider the following configuration of rectangles AEFD, EBCF, ABCD, where AEFD is not a square:
%C A188640 D................F....C
%C A188640 .......................
%C A188640 .......................
%C A188640 .......................
%C A188640 A................E....B
%C A188640 Let r=[AEFD].  The r-extension rectangle of AEFD is here introduced as the rectangle ABCD for which [AEFD]=[EBCF] and |AE|<>|EB|.  That is, AEFD has the prescribed shape r, and AEFD and EBCF are similar without being congruent.
%C A188640 We extend the definition of r-extension rectangle to the case that 0<r<1; in this case, [AEFD]=1/r and ABCD is defined as above.
%C A188640 Then for all r>0, it is easy to prove that [ABCD] = (r+sqrt(4+r^2))/2.
%C A188640 This here is the length/width ratio for the (2e)-extension rectangle.
%C A188640 A (2e)-extension rectangle matches the continued fraction A188796 for the shape L/W=(e+sqrt(1+e^2). This is analogous to the matching of a golden rectangle to the continued fraction [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,...].  Specifically, for the (2e)-extension rectangle, 5 squares are removed first, then 1 square, then 1 square, then 1 square, then 1 square, then 2 squares..., so that the original rectangle is partitioned into an infinite collection of squares.
%C A188640 Shapes of other r-extension rectangles, partitionable into a collection of squares in accord with the continued fraction of the shape [ABCD], are approximated at A188635-A188639, A188655-A188659, and A188720-A188737.
