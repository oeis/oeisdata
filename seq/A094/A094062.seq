%N A094062 a(n) = ceiling((3-sqrt(3))*4^(n-3)) + 1 for n>=2, a(1)=1.
%C A094062 From a new version of the camel problem. The original camel problem is discussed by de Bondt. A camel can carry one banana at a time on his back. It is on a diet and therefore can only have one banana at a time in its stomach. As soon as it has eaten a banana it walks a mile and then needs a new banana (in order to be able to continue its itinerary).
%C A094062 Let there be a stock of N bananas at the border of the desert. How far can the camel penetrate into the desert? (Of course it can form new stocks with transported bananas.)
%C A094062 The new version: Find a(n), the number of bananas needed for the camel to penetrate into the desert at least n miles.
