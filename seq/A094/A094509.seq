%N A094509 Numbers which are numerators of at least one reduced rational sum{k=1 to m} 1/k^n, taken over all positive integers m and n.
%C A094509 It appears that the only numbers that arise twice are 1 and 49.
%e A094509 49 is in the list since (m=3,n=2) gives 1/1^2+1/2^2+1/3^2 = 1+1/4+1/9= 49/36 and independently also since (m=6,n=1) gives 1/1+1/2+...+1/6 = 49/20

%E A094509 More terms from _Hugo van der Sanden_, Jun 05 2004
%E A094509 The additional terms were calculated by _Hugo van der Sanden_ based on the assumption that the numerator for (m=1, n=p) is always greater than that for (m=1, n<p) for all prime p - confirmation or disproof of that assumption would be helpful.
