%N A094960 Positive integers k such that the derivative of k-th Bernoulli polynomial B(k,x) contains only integer coefficients.
%C A094960 No other terms below 10^9. - _Max Alekseyev_, Dec 08 2011
%C A094960 Integer n belongs to this sequence if n*binomial(n-1,k)*bernoulli(k) is integer for each k=0,1,...,n-1. - _Max Alekseyev_, Dec 08 2011
%C A094960 If for a prime p>=3, n ends with base-p digits a,b with a+b>=p, then for k=(a+1)(p-1), the number n*binomial(n-1,k)*bernoulli(k) is not integer (contains p in the denominator). For p=3, this implies that n == 5, 7, or 8 (mod 9) are not in this sequence; for p=5, this implies that n = 9, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, or 24 (mod 25) are not in this sequence; and so on. - _Max Alekseyev_, Jun 04 2012
%C A094960 Conjecture: for every integer n>78, there exists a prime p>=3 such that the sum of last two base-p digits of n is at least p. This conjecture would imply that this sequence is finite and 60 is the last term. - _Max Alekseyev_, Jun 04 2012
%C A094960 The conjecture is true for all n such that n+1 is not a prime, a power of 2, or a Giuga number (A007850). In this case, there exists a prime p>=3 such that base-p representation of n ends in a,p-1 with a>0. - _Max Alekseyev_, Feb 16 2021
%e A094960 B(6,x) = x^6 - 3*x^5 + (5/2)*x^4 - (1/2)*x^2 + 1/42 so B'(6,x) contains only integer coefficients and 6 is in the sequence.
