%N A094206 a(n) = number of consistent orderings of 1..n based only on factorization.
%C A094206 Take a set of objects [n] indexed by the positive integers which multiply so that [a] [b] = [ab] (which automatically makes them commute, associate, obey gcd([a],[b])=[gcd(a,b)] etc.) and also partially define a consistent ordering relation < to obey two rules:
%C A094206 Rule 1: p<q ==> [p] < [q], for primes p,q and Rule 2: A<B, C<D ==> AC < BD, for any objects A, B, C, D.
%C A094206 Rule 2 captures certain intuitive requirements for ordering products - for example specializing A=[1] and C=D captures the idea that "multiples are larger", etc. Sequence gives number of ways of consistently ordering [1]..[n].
%C A094206 Comment from _Martin Fuller_, Feb 22 2026: (Start)
%C A094206 It is clear from the Example that [1] must be first, and it is clear from the previous Comment that Rule 2 can be applied when C=D.
%C A094206 Based on these clarifications, the attached PARI program agrees with a(1)-a(7), then continues 19, 46, 100, 262, 336, 812, 1542, 3996, 7368.
%C A094206 The original author agrees that a(8)=19 seems to be correct, and they have no additional information how the original values were calculated 20 years ago. (End)
%H A094206 Martin Fuller, <a href="/A094206/a094206.gp.txt">PARI program</a>
%e A094206 Up to n=3 there's only one way: [1], [1][2], [1][2][3], but then for n=4=2^2 the rules do not say whether [3]<[4] or [4]<[3], although they do say that [2]<[4], so we get two orderings [1][2][3][4], [1][2][4][3].
