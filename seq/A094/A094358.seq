%N A094358 Squarefree products of factors of Fermat numbers (A023394).
%C A094358 641 is the first member not in sequences A001317, A004729, etc.
%C A094358 Conjectured (by Munafo, see link) to be the same as: numbers n such that 2^^n == 1 mod n, where 2^^n is A014221(n).
%C A094358 It is clear from the observations by _Max Alekseyev_ in A023394 and the Chinese remainder theorem that any squarefree product b of divisors of Fermat numbers satisfies 2^(2^b) == 1 (mod b), hence satisfies Munafo's congruence above. The converse is true iff all Fermat numbers are squarefree. However, if nonsquarefree Fermat numbers exist, the criterion that is equivalent with Munafo's property would be "numbers b such that each prime power that divides b also divides some Fermat number". - _Jeppe Stig Nielsen_, Mar 05 2014
%C A094358 Also numbers b such that b is (squarefree and) a divisor of A051179(m) for some m. Or odd (squarefree) b where the multiplicative order of 2 mod b is a power of two. - _Jeppe Stig Nielsen_, Mar 07 2014
%C A094358 From _Jianing Song_, Nov 11 2023: (Start)
%C A094358 Also squarefree numbers k such that there exists i >= 1 such that k divides 2^^i - 1, where 2^^i = 2^2^...^2 (i times) = A014221(i): 2^^i == 1 (mod k) if and only if ord(2,k) divides 2^^(i-1) (ord(a,k) is the multiplicative order of a modulo k), so such i exists if and only if ord(2,k) is a power of 2. For such k, k divides 2^^i - 1 if and only if 2^^(i-2) >= log_2(ord(2,k)).
%C A094358 Note that 2^^(i-1) divides 2^^i implies that 2^^i - 1 divides 2^^(i+1) - 1, so this sequence is also squarefree numbers k such that k divides 2^^i - 1 for all sufficiently large i. (End)

%e A094358 3 is a term because it is in A023394.
%e A094358 51 is a term because it is 3*17 and 17 is also in A023394.
%e A094358 153 = 3*3*17 is not a term because its factorization includes two 3's.
%e A094358 See the Munafo link for examples of the (conjectured) 2^^n == 1 (mod n) property.
