%N A094348 Numbers n such that, for some numbers (j,k), j<=k, n is the smallest positive multiple of j (or more) of the first k positive integers.
%C A094348 Includes all highly composite numbers (A002182) and least common multiples of 1 through n (A003418). It would be interesting to know: 1) whether or not all deeply composite numbers (A095848, which includes all members of A003418) also belong to this sequence; 2) if 72 is the only member of this sequence not also belonging to A002182 or A095848.
%C A094348 465585120 is the first member of A095848 that is not a member of this sequence. The first members that belong to neither A002182 nor A095848 are 72, 30240, 64864800 and 1470268800. - _David Wasserman_, Jun 28 2007
%C A094348 This sequence is also A096179 with duplicates deleted and sorted. Let F(n) be the number of the row of A096179 which has the first occurrence of a(n) and M(n) = max{F(i),i <= n}. Then the following table indicates this connection.
