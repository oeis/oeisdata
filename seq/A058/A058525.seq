%N A058525 Odd numbers z by which not all integers y, 0 <= y < 2^64, can be divided using "high multiplication" followed by a right shift.
%C A058525 For many odd numbers z, it is possible to compute the integer division of y / z for 0 <= y < 2^64 (that is, floor(y/z)) by multiplying by a suitable constant a and shifting right: floor((a*y)/(2^(64+e))). a is computed as a = ceiling((2^(64+e))/z), where e is such that 2^e < z < 2^(e+1).
%C A058525 Knuth showed that the formula floor((a*y)/(2^(64+e))) = floor(y/z) holds for all y, 0 <= y < 2^64, if and only if it holds for the single value y = 2^64 - 1 - (2^64 mod z).
%C A058525 There are 189 odd divisors z less than 1000 for which this method cannot be used to find the division result for all y, 0 <= y < 2^64.

%e A058525 For the first term in the sequence, 7, floor(ay/(2^(64+e))) = 2635249153387078802 for y = 2^64 - 1 - (2^64 mod z) = 18446744073709551613, while floor(y/z) = 2635249153387078801.
%e A058525 Example for a term not in the sequence: for 9, both floor(ay/(2^(64+e))) and floor(y/z) are 2049638230412172400 for y = 2^64 - 1 - (2^64 mod z) = 18446744073709551608.
