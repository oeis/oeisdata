%N A058759 Shannon switching function: a(n) is the least number k such that any switching (or Boolean) function of n variables can be realized as a two-terminal network of AND's and OR's in which the total number of occurrences of the variables X_1, X_1', ..., X_n, X_n' is no more than k (where the primes indicate complements).
%C A058759 The variables X_1, ..., X_n and their negated values X_1', ..., X_n' are available, we only use AND's and OR's and we wish to minimize the total number of appearances of X_1, X_1', ..., X_n, X_n'. What is the worst case?
%C A058759 To describe this another way: X_i and X_i' are the (front and back) contacts (or elements) of a two-terminal network. Let L(S) be the number of contacts in a network S and L(f) = min L(S), where minimum is taken over all networks S which realize the Boolean function f. Then a(n) = max L(f), where maximum is taken over all n-variable Boolean functions.

%F A058759 For any epsilon > 0, a(n) > (1-epsilon)*2^n/n for sufficiently large n (Shannon). For any epsilon > 0, a(n) <= (1+epsilon)*2^n/n for sufficiently large n (Lupanov). Hence a(n) ~ 2^n/n as n tends to infinity.
