%N A058642 Number of unlabeled graphs with n edges, no nodes of degree 1 or 2, no multiple edges and no cut nodes, under "series-equivalence".
%C A058642 Under "series-equivalence" two graphs are equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by exchanging two subgraphs in series: replacing -A-B- by -B-A-.
