%N A058986 Sorting by prefix reversal (or "flipping pancakes"). You can only reverse segments that include the initial term of the current permutation; a(n) is the number of reversals that are needed to transform an arbitrary permutation of n letters to the identity permutation.
%C A058986 "The chef in our place is sloppy and when he prepares a stack of pancakes they come out all different sizes. Therefore when I deliver them to a customer, on the way to the table I rearrange them (so that the smallest winds up on top and so on, down to the largest at the bottom) by grabbing several from the top and flipping them over, repeating this (varying the number I flip) as many times as necessary. If there are n pancakes, what is the maximum number of flips (as a function a(n) of n) that I will ever have to use to rearrange them?" [Dweighter]
%C A058986 J. K. McLean (jkmclean(AT)webone.com.au): If the worst case for n pancakes is x flips, then the worst case for n+1 pancakes can be no greater than x+2 flips. Getting the n+1 pancake to the bottom of the pile will require 0, 1 or 2 flips, after which you can sort the n remaining pancakes in at most x flips.
%C A058986 Comments based on email message from Brian Hayes, Oct 10 2007: (Start)
%C A058986 We are interested in the diameter of the graph where the vertices are all possible permutations of n elements and an edge connects p(i) and p(j) if some allowed reversal transforms p(i) into p(j).
%C A058986 There are at least two dimensions to consider in describing the various sorting-by-reversal problems: (a) Are the elements of the sequence signed or unsigned? and (b) Are we constrained to work only from one end of the sequence?
%C A058986 The standard pancake problem has unsigned elements and allows moves only from the top of the stack; the diameter is given by the present sequence.
%C A058986 The "burnt-pancake" problem has signed elements and allows moves only from the top of the stack. This is sequence A078941 (and also A078942).
%C A058986 The biologically-inspired sorting problems I was writing about in the Amer. Scientist 2007 column dispense with the one-end-only constraint. You're allowed to reverse any segment of contiguous elements, anywhere in the permutation. For the unsigned case, a(n) = n-1 (cf. Kececioglu and Sankoff).
%C A058986 Finally there is the signed case without the one-end constraint. This was the main subject of my column and corresponds to sequence A131209. (End)
%C A058986 Brian Goodwin (brian_goodwin(AT)yahoo.com), Aug 22 2005, comments that the terms so far match the beginning of the following triangle:
%C A058986                     0
%C A058986                     1
%C A058986                  3  4  5
%C A058986               7  8  9 10 11
%C A058986           13 14 15 16 17 18 19
%C A058986        21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29
%C A058986     31 32 ...
%C A058986 Is this a coincidence? Answer from Mikola Lysenko (mclysenk(AT)mtu.edu), Dec 09 2006: Unfortunately, Yes! That triangular sequence has the closed form: a(n) = n - 1 + floor(sqrt(n-2)). However, Gates and Papadimitrou establish a lower bound on the pancake sequence of at least (17/16)*n. For sufficiently large n, this is always larger than the number in the triangle.
%C A058986 Marc Lebrun writes that in 1975 he was involved with a group called the "People's Computer Company" and among the many early computer games they created and popularized was one called "Reverse", which they published in their newspaper. See link.
%C A058986 M. Peczarski and I affirm the value a(19) = 22 as given by Simon Singh. Firstly, a(19) >= 22 as stated in the paper by Heydari Sudborough. This statement is mentioned on page 93. There two permutations of order 19 are given which need at least 22 flips. These permutations are 1,7,5,3,6,4,2,8,14,12,10,13,11,9,15,17,19,16,18 and 1,7,5,3,6,4,2,8,14,12,10,13,11,9,15,18,16,19,17. Making use of a branch-and-bound algorithm, we can confirm that their statement is correct. Together with the result that a(18) = 20, this gives a(19) = 22. Both values a(18) = 20 and a(19) = 22 were also proved in the paper by Cibulka. - _Gerold Jäger_, Oct 29 2020
