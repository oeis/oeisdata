%N A058760 Integers whose set of prime factors (taken with multiplicity) uses each digit exactly once (i.e., is pandigital) in some base b > 1. Numbers are expressed in base 10.
%C A058760 Note that the appropriate base for each number is not given here.
%e A058760 19 in base 3 is 201, which is pandigital, so it qualifies (having just itself as a prime factor). A more elaborate example is 5662 = 2 * 19 * 149, which in base 6 is 2 * 31 * 405, also pandigital.
