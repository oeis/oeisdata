%N A209407 Primes p(i) such that p(i+1)/p(i) > p(k+1)/p(k) for all k>i, where p(i) is the i-th prime.
%C A209407 p(i) belongs to the sequence if p(i+1)/p(i) > p(k+1)/p(k) for all k>i.
%C A209407 It follows from the prime number theorem that p(i+1)/p(i) converges to 1 as i tends to infinity. a(n) is an infinite sequence therefore. The a(n) constitute "record holders" for the relative size of the prime number gaps.
%C A209407 The values a(n) given above were obtained by comparing p(i+1)/p(i) with p(k+1)/p(k) for 1<=i<=5949 and k ranging from i+1 to 200000 for given i.
%C A209407 In order to show that these values are correct one has to analyze the error terms in the formula p(k) ~ k*log(k) and extend the "test range" if needed. Using Dusart's bound: n*(log(n)+loglog(n)-1) < p(n) < n*(log(n)+loglog(n)) for n>=6 one gets
%C A209407 p(k+1)/p(k) < f(k):=(1+1/k)*(log(k+1)+loglog(k+1))/(log(k)+loglog(k)-1) for all k>=6. However this bound tends to 1 like 1+1/log(k) as k->oo. In order to verify, for example, that the term a(9)=199=p(46) is correct one must make sure that p(k+1)/p(k) < p(47)/p(46) = 211/199 =~ 1.0603 for all k>47. However f(10^7)~=1.06666 still, so k <= 10^7 is not sufficient to validate a(9). a(8) however is validated by checking the range k<=10^7.
%C A209407 In order to validate terms up to a(n)=31397 for example one even needs k<=10^20 roughly which needs considerable computational power.
%C A209407 This can be improved with another of Dusart's bounds: there is always a prime in (x, x + x/(25log^2 x)) for x > 396738. Hence it suffices to check up to the higher of exp(1/(25 (prime(i+1)/prime(i)-1))) and 396738. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Mar 06 2013
