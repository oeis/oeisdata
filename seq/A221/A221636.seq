%N A221636 Odd numbers n with the property that Collatz (3x+1) trajectory of n contains exactly four terms that are divisible by 5.
%C A221636 Many of the numbers have trajectories containing the numbers 40, 20, 10, 5. However, the trajectory of 75 shows another possibility: 75, 340, 170, 85. Is this sequence infinite?

%e A221636 Collatz trajectory of 7 is {7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1}. It contains the numbers 40, 20, 10, 5 and no other term divisible by 5. Because no integer < 7 has this property, a(1) = 7.
