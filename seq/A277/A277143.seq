%N A277143 Lexicographically least sequence of nonnegative integers that avoids 5/3-powers.
%C A277143 This sequence is 7-regular.
%C A277143 More generally, if a/b is a rational number in the interval 5/3 <= a/b < 2 with gcd(b, 2) = 1 and gcd(a, b) = 1, then the lexicographically least sequence of nonnegative integers that avoids a/b-powers is (2 a - b)-regular.
