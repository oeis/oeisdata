%N A277694 Numbers which cannot occur in A277623, where any odd digit d must be followed by d even digits.
%C A277694 Any number which contains a term of this sequence as a substring is again in this sequence. Therefore one might call those terms of this sequence which do not contain a smaller term as a substring "primitive". The non-primitive terms are 110 - 119, 130 - 139, ..., 211, 213, 215, etc.
%e A277694 Any digit '1' must be followed by exactly one even digit if the number is in A277623. Therefore 11, 13, 17, 19 (and any number which contains these, such as 110 or 211), and also 100, 102, ... are not allowed there and are thus listed here.
%e A277694 Similarly, any digit '3' must be followed by exactly three even digits in A277623. Therefore 31, 33, 37, 39, and also 301, 303, ... cannot appear there and are listed here.
