%N A005991 a(n) is the index of the last occurrence of the n-th distinct term (equal to n+1) in sequence A155934(m) = k(m) = the least integer such that every m X m (0,1)-matrix with exactly k(m) ones in each row and in each column contains a 2 X 2 submatrix without zeros.
%C A005991 While this sequence uses indices n = 1, 2, 3,... to refer to the n-th distinct term of A155934 (which is equal to n+1), sequence A003509 uses indices n = 2, 3, 4, ... to refer to the values of the distinct terms. - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 07 2025

%F A005991 a(n) = A003509(n + 2) - 1, for n >= 1. - _Sean A. Irvine_, Jun 04 2015, corrected by _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 07 2025
%e A005991 Since k(2) = 2, we have a(1) = 2.
%e A005991 Since k(3) = k(4) = k(5) = k(6) = 3, we have a(2) = 6.
%e A005991 Since k(7) = k(8) = ... = k(12) = 4, we have a(3) = 12.
%e A005991 Since k(13) = k(14) = ... = k(20) = 5, we have a(4) = 20.
%e A005991 Since k(21) = k(22) = ... = k(30) = 6, we have a(5) = 30.
%e A005991 Since k(31) = k(32) = ... = k(43) = 7, we have a(6) = 43.
