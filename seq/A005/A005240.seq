%N A005240 P-positions in Epstein's Put or Take a Square game.
%C A005240 The game is played with two layers alternatingly removing or adding chips on a heap. If C denotes the number of chips on the heap, a player must either put or take the largest possible square number of chips in his move, C -> C +- A048760(C). The player capable of taking all chips wins. The P positions are numbers of chips where the player to draw first will lose (assuming the opponent has a full analysis of the game). - _R. J.
