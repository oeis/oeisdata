%N A005427 Josephus problem: numbers m such that, when m people are arranged on a circle and numbered 1 through m, the final survivor when we remove every 4th person is one of the first three people.
%C A005427 Is this the same as A072493 with its first 8 terms removed? See also the similar conjecture concerning A005428 and A073941.
%C A005427 From _Petros Hadjicostas_, Jul 20 2020: (Start)
%C A005427 We describe the counting-off game of Burde (1987) using language from Schuh (1968). Suppose m people are labeled with the numbers 1 through m (say clockwise). (Burde uses the numbers 0 through m-1 probably because he relates this problem to the representation of m in the fractional base k/(k-1) = 4/3. He actually modifies the (4/3)-representation of m to include negative coefficients. See the coefficients f(n;k) below.)
%C A005427 Suppose we start the counting at the person labeled 1, and we remove every 4th person. This sequence gives those numbers m for which the last survivor is one of the first three people.
%C A005427 When m = 5, 9, 12, 16, 218, 517, ... the last survivor is the first person.
%C A005427 When m = 7, 29, 69, 92, 291, 388, ... the last survivor is the second person.
%C A005427 When m = 22, 39, 52, 123, 164, 690, ... the last survivor is the third person.
%C A005427 If we know m = a(n) and the number, say i(n), of the last survivor (when there are a(n) people on the circle), we may find a(n+1) and the number i(n+1) of the new last survivor (when there are a(n+1) people on the circle) in the following way:
%C A005427 (a) If 0 = a(n) mod 3, then a(n+1) = (4/3)*a(n), and i(n+1) = i(n).
%C A005427 (b) If 1 = a(n) mod 3 and i(n) = 1, then a(n+1) = ceiling((4/3)*a(n)) and i(n+1) = 3.
%C A005427 (c) If 1 = a(n) mod 3 and i(n) = 2, then a(n+1) = floor((4/3)*a(n)) and i(n+1) = 1.
%C A005427 (d) If 1 = a(n) mod 3 and i(n) = 3, then a(n+1) = floor((4/3)*a(n)) and i(n+1) = 2.
%C A005427 (e) If 2 = a(n) mod 3 and i(n) = 1, then a(n+1) = ceiling((4/3)*a(n)) and i(n+1) = 2.
%C A005427 (f) If 2 = a(n) mod 3 and i(n) = 2, then a(n+1) = ceiling((4/3)*a(n)) and i(n+1) = 3.
%C A005427 (g) If 2 = a(n) mod 3 and i(n) = 3, then a(n+1) = floor((4/3)*a(n)) and i(n+1) = 1. (End)
%C A005427 From _Petros Hadjicostas_, Jul 22 2020: (Start)
%C A005427 In general, for k >= 2, it seems that when m people are placed on a circle, labeled 1 through m, and every k-th person is removed (starting the counting at person 1), we may determine those m for which the last survivor is in {1, 2, ..., k-1} in the following way.
%C A005427 Define the sequence (T(n;k): n >= 1) by T(n;k) = ceiling(Sum_{s=1..n-1} T(s;k)/(k-1)) for n >= 2 starting with T(1; k) = 1. Then the list of those m's for which the last survivor is in {1, 2, ..., k-1} consists of all the numbers T(n;k) >= k (thus, we exclude the cases m = 1, ..., k-1 that may be repeated more than once in the sequence (T(n;k): n >= 1)).
%C A005427 I do not have a general proof of this conjecture though I strongly believe that Schuh's (1968) way of solving the case k = 3 (see pp. 373-375 and 377-379, where he provides two methods of solution) may provide clues for proving the conjecture.
%C A005427 We have T(n; k=2) = A011782(n+1), T(n; k=3) = A073941(n), T(n; k=4) = A072493(n), T(n; k=5) = A120160(n), T(n; k=6) = A120170(n), T(n; k=7) = A120178(n), T(n; k=8) = A120186(n), T(n; k=9) = A120194(n), and T(n; k=10) = A120202(n).
%C A005427 We also have T(n+1;k) = floor((k/(k-1))*T(n;k)) or ceiling((k/(k-1)*T(n;k)).
%C A005427 To identify the last survivor that results when we place T(n; k) people on the circle (with T(n;k) >= k) in the above Josephus problem, we use a modification of Burde's algorithm due to Thériault (2000).
%C A005427 We use the following recursions but we start at T(k;k) (rather than at the smallest n for which T(n;k) >= k). Define the sequence (S(n;k): n >= 1) by S(n;k) = T(n+k-1; k) for n >= 1. (It is easy to prove that S(1;k) = T(k;k) = 1.)
%C A005427 Define also the sequences (j(n;k): n >= 1) and (f(n;k): n >= 1) by j(1;k) = 1, f(1;k) = 0, f(n+1;k) = ((j(n;k) - S(n;k) - 1) mod (k-1)) + 1 - j(n;k) and j(n+1;k) = j(n;k) + f(n+1;k) for n >= 2.
%C A005427 Then for all n s.t. S(n;k) >= k, j(n;k) is the number of the last survivor of the Josephus problem where every k-th person is removed (provided we start the counting at number 1). It will always be the case that j(n;k) is in {1,2,...,k-1}.
%C A005427 We actually have S(n+1; k) = (k*S(n;k) + f(n+1;k))/(k-1) for n >= 1.
%C A005427 Notice that the Burde-Thériault algorithm is a generalization of Schuh's method. (End)

%e A005427 From _Petros Hadjicostas_, Jul 22 2020: (Start)
%e A005427 We explain why 5 and 7 are in the sequence but 6 is not.
%e A005427 If we put m = 5 people on the circle, label them 1 through 5, start the counting at person 1, and remove every 4th person, then the list of people who are removed is 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 2. Thus, the last survivor is 1, so m = 5 is included in this sequence.
%e A005427 If we put m = 6 people on a circle, label them 1 through 6, start the counting at person 1, and remove every 4th person, then the list of people who are removed is 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 6. Thus, the last survivor is 5 (not 1, 2, or 3), so m = 6 is not included in this sequence.
%e A005427 If we put m = 7 people on a circle, label them 1 through 7, start the counting at person 1, and remove every 4th person, then the list of people who are removed is 4 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 7 -> 3. Thus, the last survivor is 2, so m = 7 is included in this sequence.
%e A005427 Strictly speaking, m = 2 and m = 3 should have been included as well (since clearly the last survivor would be 1 or 2 or 3). In addition, m = 4 should have been included as well because the list of people removed is 4 -> 1 -> 3. The case of number 1 does create a problem since there is no survivor. Note that the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 are all included in A072493. (End)
