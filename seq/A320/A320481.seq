%N A320481 Primes in A301916 but not in A045318.
%C A320481 Is there a simpler characterization of these primes?
%C A320481 Answer from _Don Reble_, Oct 25 2018: (Start)
%C A320481 Let POT(x) be the largest power of 2 which divides x (A006519).
%C A320481 Apart from the initial 2, this sequence consists of those primes P such that
%C A320481         2 <= POT(the order of 3 modulo P) <= POT(P-1)/8.
%C A320481 The condition "2 <=" ensures that P divides some 3^k+1, and the condition "<= POT(P-1)/8" is so that 3 has an eighth root modulo P.  A062117 is the order of 3 modulo prime(n). (End)

%C A320481 When considering methods for finding square roots mod p one is led to filtering the nonzero elements by the power of 2 dividing the multiplicative order of the element. The lowest level -- elements of odd order -- have easily computed square roots, and the square roots of other elements can be found if you can discover at least one element at a higher level.
%C A320481 To say that "x^8 = 3 has no solution mod p" is to say that 3 is in one of the top three levels and that there are more than 3 levels (so that 8 divides p-1).
%C A320481 To say that primes "divide numbers of the form 3^k + 1" is to say that -1 is a power of 3 mod p, or that 3 is not at the lowest level. If there are only four levels (9 mod 16), these statements are equivalent. Otherwise, the two statements are different. An interesting case has 3 at the second level, so that (-3) has odd order allowing cube roots of unity to be found quickly.
%C A320481 I was told that Odoni had some results on finding the number of primes with k levels for which a given number (e.g., 3) is at level j, but I never tracked down a reference. If the asymptotic behavior is what one would expect, A045318 and A301916 are really far from being "almost the same", except in the trivial sense of "zero density". (End)
