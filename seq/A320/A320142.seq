%N A320142 Numbers that have exactly two middle divisors.
%C A320142 Conjecture 1: numbers k with the property that the difference between the number of partitions of k into an odd number of consecutive parts and the number of partitions of k into an even number of consecutive parts is equal to 2.
%C A320142 Conjecture 2: numbers k with the property that symmetric representation of sigma(k) has width 2 on the main diagonal.
%e A320142 15 is in the sequence because 15 has two middle divisors: 3 and 5.
%e A320142 On the other hand, in accordance with the first conjecture, 15 is in the sequence because there are three partitions of 15 into an odd number of consecutive parts: [15], [8, 7], [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], and there is only one partition of 15 into an even number of consecutive parts: [8, 7], therefore the difference of the number of those partitions is 3 - 1 = 2.
%e A320142 On the other hand, in accordance with the second conjecture, 15 is in the sequence because the symmetric representation of sigma(15) = 24 has width 2 on the main diagonal, as shown below in the fourth quadrant:
