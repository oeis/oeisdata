%N A206551 Moduli n for which the multiplicative group Modd n is cyclic.
%C A206551 For Modd n (not to be confused with mod n) see a comment on A203571.
%C A206551 For n=1 one has the Modd 1 residue class [0], the integers. The group of order 1 is the cyclic group Z_1 with the unit element 0==1 (Modd 1). [Changed by _Wolfdieter Lang_, Apr 04 2012]
%C A206551 For the non-cyclic (acyclic) values see A206552.
%C A206551 For these numbers n, and only for these (only the n values < 100 are shown above), there exist primitive roots Modd n. See the nonzero values of A206550 for the smallest positive ones.
%C A206551   For n=1 the primitive root is 0 == 1 (Modd 1), see above.
%C A206551 For n>=1 the multiplicative group Modd n is the Galois group Gal(Q(rho(n))/Q), with the algebraic number rho(n) := 2*cos(Pi/n) with minimal polynomial C(n,x), whose coefficients are given in A187360.
%F A206551 A206550(a(n)) > 0, n>=1.
%e A206551 a(2) = 2 for the multiplicative group Modd 2, with representative [1], and there is a primitive root, namely 1, because 1^1 = 1 == 1 (Modd 1). The cycle structure is [[1]], the group is Z_1.
%e A206551 a(3) = 3 for the multiplicative group Modd 3 which coincides with the one for Modd 2.
%e A206551 a(4) = 4  or the multiplicative group Modd 4 with representatives [1,3]. The smallest positive  primitive root is 3, because 3^2 == 1 (Modd 4). This group is cyclic, it is Z_2.
%Y A206551 Cf. A206550, A033948 (mod n case).
