%N A206499 The sum of the distances between all unordered pairs of branch vertices in the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number n. A branch vertex is a vertex of degree >=3.
%C A206499 The Matula-Goebel number of a rooted tree can be defined in the following recursive manner: to the one-vertex tree there corresponds the number 1; to a tree T with root degree 1 there corresponds the t-th prime number, where t is the Matula-Goebel number of the tree obtained from T by deleting the edge emanating from the root; to a tree T with root degree m>=2 there corresponds the product of the Matula-Goebel numbers of the m branches of T.
%C A206499 The A. Ilic and M. Ilic reference considers the statistic: the sum of the distances between all unordered pairs of vertices of degree k (see A212618, A212619).

%F A206499 Let bigomega(n) denote the number of prime divisors of n, counted with multiplicities. Let g(n)=g(n,x) be the generating polynomial of the branch vertices of the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number n with respect to level. We have a(1) = 0; if n = prime(t) and bigomega(t) is not 2, then a(n) = a(t); if n = prime(t) and bigomega(t) = 2, then a(n) = a(t) + [dg(t)/dx]_{x=1}; if n = r*s with r prime, bigomega(s) != 2, then a(n) = a(r) + a(s) + [d[g(r)g(s)]/dx]_{x=1}; if n=r*s with r prime, bigomega(s)=2, then a(n)=a(r)+a(s)+ [d[g(r)g(s)]/dx]_{x=1} + [dg(r)/dx]_{x=1} + [dg(s)/dx]_{x=1}.
%e A206499 a(28)=1 because the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number 28 is the rooted tree obtained by joining the trees I, I, and Y at their roots; it has 2 branch vertices and the distance between them is 1. a(49)=2 because the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number 49 is the rooted tree obtained by joining two copies of Y at their roots; it has 2 branch vertices and the distance between them is 2.
