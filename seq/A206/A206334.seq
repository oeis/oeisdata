%N A206334 Numbers n such that there is a triangle with area n, side n, and the other two sides rational.
%C A206334 n>3 is in the sequence just in case the elliptic curve y^2 = 4*x^4 + (n^2+8)*x^2 + 4 has positive rank.  Note that (0,2) is on that curve.
%C A206334 n is in the sequence just in case there are positive rational numbers x,y such that x*y>1 and x - 1/x + y - 1/y = n.
%C A206334 The triangle whose sides are [(4*k^6+8*k^5+8*k^4+4*k^3+2*k^2+2*k+1)/((k+1)*k*(2*k^2+2*k+1)), (4*k^6+16*k^5+28*k^4+28*k^3+18*k^2+6*k+1)/((k+1)*k*(2*k^2+2*k+1)), 4*k^2+4*k+4] has area equal to its third side.  Hence, starting with the second term, A112087 is a subsequence of the present sequence.
%C A206334 The triangle whose sides are [(k^6+2*k^4+k^2+1)/(k*(k^2+1)), (k^4+3*k^2+1)/(k*(k^2+1)), (k^2+2)*k] has area equal to its third side. Hence, starting with the first positive term, A054602 is a subsequence of the present sequence. [This subsequence found by Dragan K, see second link, below.]
%C A206334 The triangle whose sides are [(k^8+6*k^6+13*k^4+13*k^2+4)/(k*(k^2+2)*(k^2+1)), (k^6+3*k^4+5*k^2+4)/(k*(k^2+2)*(k^2+1)), k*(k^2+4)] has area equal to its third side. Hence A155965 is a subsequence of the present sequence.
