%N A206495 Irregular triangle read by rows: row n contains in nondecreasing order the Matula-Goebel numbers of the elements of N(t), where t is the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number n and N is the natural growth operator.
%C A206495 The natural growth operator maps a rooted tree t with V(t) vertices to the sequence of V(t) rooted trees, each having 1+V(t) vertices, by attaching one more outgoing edge and vertex to each vertex of t (the root remains the same). See, for example, the Brouder reference, p. 522 or the Connes-Kreimer reference, p. 225.
%C A206495 The Matula-Goebel number of a rooted tree can be defined in the following recursive manner: to the one-vertex tree there corresponds the number 1; to a tree T with root degree 1 there corresponds the t-th prime number, where t is the Matula-Goebel number of the tree obtained from T by deleting the edge emanating from the root; to a tree T with root degree m>=2 there corresponds the product of the Matula-Goebel numbers of the m branches of T.
%C A206495 Number of entries in row n is A061775(n).

%F A206495 Denote the natural growth operator by NG. It is convenient to introduce a "modified natural growth operator" MNG, defined just like NG, except that no edge is attached to the root. By NG(k) and MNG(k) we mean the action of these operators on the tree with Matula-Goebel number k. (i) NG(n) = [2n, MNG(n)]; (ii) MNG(1) = [ ]; (iii) if NG(t) = [a,b,c,...], then MNG(t-th prime) = [a-th prime, b-th prime, c-th prime, ...]; if r,s,>=2, then NG(rs) = [2rs,  r multiplied by the elements of MNG(s); s multiplied by the elements of MNG(r)]. The Maple program is based on these recurrence relations.
%e A206495 Row 2 is 3,4 because the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number 2 is the 1-edge tree; attaching one edge at each vertex, we obtain \/ and the 2-edge path, having Matula-Goebel numbers 4 and 3, respectively.
