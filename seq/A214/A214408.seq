%N A214408 Abundant numbers for which the abundance is not a divisor.
%C A214408 The abundance of a number is sigma(n) - 2n (A033880).
%C A214408 Most of these numbers are pseudoperfect (A005835), but more than one proper divisor is left out of the sum.
%C A214408 The first odd term is 945, the second is 1575. The smallest odd abundant number not in this sequence is 173369889, found by _Donovan Johnson_. _Peter J. C. Moses_ has verified all other odd abundant numbers up to 1.4 * 10^19 have an abundance that is not a proper divisor.
%C A214408 Almost all multiples of 6 are in this sequence. Given a prime p > 3, the abundance of 6p works out to 12, but 6p is not divisible by 4, though it is by 2 and by 3. The abundance of 12p is 16p + 28, and clearly that is not a divisor of 12p. Multiples of 6 with more prime factors will have abundances that are greater than the largest proper divisor by greater margins still.

%e A214408 The abundance of 36 is 19, but 19 is not a divisor of 36, hence 36 is in the sequence.
%e A214408 The abundance of 40 is 10, which is a divisor of 40, hence 40 is not in the sequence.
