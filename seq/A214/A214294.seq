%N A214294 The maximum number of V-pentominoes covering the cells of square n × n.
%C A214294 The problem of determining the maximum number of V-pentominoes (or the densest packing) covering the cells of the square n × n  was proposed by A. Cibulis.
%C A214294 Problem for the squares 5 × 5, 6 × 6 and 8 × 8 was given in the Latvian Open Mathematics Olympiad 2000 for Forms 6, 8 and 5 respectively.
%C A214294 Solutions for the squares 3 × 3, 5 × 5, 8 × 8, 12 × 12, 16 × 16 are unique under rotation and reflection.
