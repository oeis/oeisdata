%N A214305 Fermat pseudoprimes to base 2 with two prime factors.
%C A214305 This sequence is the same as A050217 for the first 60 terms and starts to differ at the 61st.
%C A214305 Conjecture: For any biggest prime factor of a Poulet number p1 with two prime factors, there exists a series with infinitely many Poulet numbers p2 formed this way: p2 mod (p1 - d) = d, where d is the biggest prime factor of p1. Note: it can be seen that the Poulet numbers divisible by 73 bigger than 2701 (7957, 10585, 15841, 31609, etc.) can be written as 1314*n + 73 as well as 2628*m + 73.
%C A214305 Conjecture: Any Poulet number p2 divisible by d can be written as (p1 - d)*n + d, where n is a positive integer, if there exists a smaller Poulet number p1 with two prime factors divisible by d.
%C A214305 Note: This conjecture can't be extrapolated for Poulet numbers p1 with more than two prime factors; for instance, if p1 = 561 = 3*11*17, there indeed are bigger Poulet numbers divisible by 17 (such as 1105 and 4369) that can be written as 544*n + 17, but there also exist such numbers that can't be written this way, e.g., 2465. But the first conjecture can be extrapolated.
%C A214305 Conjecture: For any biggest prime factor of a Poulet number p1 exists a series with infinitely many Poulet numbers p2 formed this way: p2 mod (p1 - d) = d, where d is the biggest prime factor of p1.
%C A214305 For each prime p, there are only a finite number of q such that p*q is here. See A085014. Sequence A180471 lists the factors of terms of this sequence. - _T. D. Noe_, Sep 20 2012
%C A214305 Numbers n = p*q such that n divides 2^(p-1)-1 and 2^(q-1)-1, where p,q are primes; thus 2^gcd(p-1,q-1) == 1 (mod n). - _Thomas Ordowski_, Aug 27 2016
%C A214305 These are semiprimes p*q such that 2^(p+q-2) == 1 (mod p*q). Proof: 2^(p-1) == 1 (mod p) and 2^(q-1) == 1 (mod q), so 2^((p-1)*(q-1)) == 1 (mod p*q), and (p-1)*(q-1) = (p*q-1)-(p+q-2). - _Amiram Eldar_ and _Thomas Ordowski_, Apr 02 2021
