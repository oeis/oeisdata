%N A214565 Sum(M(t)), where summation is over all rooted trees t with n vertices and M(t) is the number of ways to take apart t by sequentially removing terminal edges (see A206494).

%F A214565 Apparently, no formula is available. The example gives a hint how the first ten terms of the sequence have been computed (using Maple).
%e A214565 a(4) = 12 because there are four rooted trees with 4 vertices; their Matula-Goebel numbers are 5,6,7, and 8 and, consequently M(5)+M(6)+M(7)+M(8) = 1+3+2+6 = 12 (see A206494).
