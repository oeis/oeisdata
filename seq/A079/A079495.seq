%N A079495 Numbers k such that the sum of the squares of the digits of k in base 3 is 0 (mod 3).
%C A079495 In base 2 this gives the "Evil Numbers" (cf. A001969) and slope 2. One may conjecture that in base b the asymptotic slope will be b and might suspect asymptotic density 1/b for each result (mod b). For nonprime b larger variations occur and "very big" numbers must be considered to believe in the conjecture (1 million or more...). (Related to A006287, here mod b is considered)
%e A079495 59 is a member because 59 = 2013_3 and 2^2+0^2+1^2+1^2 = 6 = 0 (mod 3).
%t A079495 Ev = Function[{b, x}, vx = IntegerDigits[x, b]; Mod[vx.vx, b]]; Seq = Function[{b, n}, Flatten[Position[Table[Ev[b, k], {k, 1, n}], 0]]]; Seq[3, 1000]
%Y A079495 Cf. A001969, A006287, A075311.
