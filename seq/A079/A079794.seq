%N A079794 Smallest number having k digits "k" (k=1,...,n) but any two adjacent digits are different.
%C A079794 How many such numbers can be formed?
%C A079794 From _M. F. Hasler_, Jun 22 2007: (Start)
%C A079794 The first (n-1)(n-2)/2 digits of a(n) (part (1) of the formula) remain the same for all subsequent terms.
%C A079794 Terms of the sequence do not really depend on the base: for any base b>n, terms a(1)..a(n) would read the same. Thus one could add "(in base n+1)" to the definition and delete the keyword "base".
%C A079794 The sequence could be extended to terms n>9 in two ways: (1) by writing a(n) according to the prescription in base n+1, but recording the corresponding value in base 10; (2) by providing a convention for encoding digits d > 9, e.g. by pre-pending them with '0#' (knowing they will never occur at the beginning of a(n)), where # is the number of characters used to write the digit (encoded recursively in the same way if #>9). (End)
%F A079794 To get a(n): (1) start with an empty string and always concatenate the smallest possible of the remaining digits, until there are 2n-1 digits left (n "n"s and n-1 other digits); (2) insert the n-1 other digits in-between the "n"s and concatenate this result to the first string.
