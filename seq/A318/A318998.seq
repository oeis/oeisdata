%N A318998 Number of stable nuclides with neutron number n.
%C A318998 Radioactive nuclides with a half-life of 700 million years or greater (i.e., half-life longer than or equal to that of uranium-235) are included.
%C A318998 The last known term is a(177) = 0.
%C A318998 Sum_{n=0..177} a(n) = 286, which is the number of known stable nuclides.
%C A318998 For n <= 126, a(n) = 0 for n = 19, 35, 39, 45, 61, 89, 115, 123.
%C A318998 The total number of stable nuclides with an even neutron number is 220, while for odd neutron number it's 66.
%C A318998 The number of even numbers k such that a(k) = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 are 5, 6, 28, 19, 6, 1, 1. There are 46 odd numbers such that a(k) = 1 and only 10 such that a(k) = 2.
