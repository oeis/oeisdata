%N A318239 a(n) is the smallest primitive root of A133433(n).
%C A318239 Also with an initial 1, numbers k such that A023048(k) set a new record.
%C A318239 If A023048(108) != 0 (which is implied assuming generalized Artin's conjecture) then the next term of this sequence is 108.
%C A318239 Conjecturally 11 is the largest prime in this sequence, 42 is the largest squarefree term, and 45 is the largest odd term.

%e A318239 The smallest prime with least primitive root 11 is 643, and the smallest prime with least primitive root 2, 3, 5, ..., 10 are all < 643, so 11 is a term.
%e A318239 The smallest prime with least primitive root 45 is 95525767, and the smallest prime with least primitive root 2, 3, 5, ..., 44 are all < 95525767, so 45 is a term.
%e A318239 13 is not a term since the smallest prime with least primitive root 13 is 457, but the smallest prime with least primitive root 12 is 4111, which is larger than 457.
%Y A318239 Cf. A023048, A133433.
