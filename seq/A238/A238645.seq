%N A238645 Number of odd primes p < 2*n such that the number of squarefree numbers among 1, ..., ((p-1)/2)*n is prime.
%C A238645 Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n > 1, and a(n) = 1 only for n = 2, 4, 7, 14, 19, 29.
%C A238645 This is an analog of the conjecture in A237578 for squarefree numbers. We have verified it for n up to 20000.
%C A238645 See also A238646 for a similar conjecture involving squarefree numbers.

%e A238645 a(4) = 1 since 3 is prime and there are exactly 3 squarefree numbers among 1, ..., (3-1)/2*4 (namely, 1, 2, 3).
%e A238645 a(14) = 1 since 5 and 17 are both prime, and there are exactly 17 squarefree numbers among 1, ..., (5-1)/2*14.
%e A238645 a(19) = 1 since 3 and 13 are both prime, and there are exactly 13 squarefree numbers among 1, ..., (3-1)/2*19 (namely, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19).
%e A238645 a(29) = 1 since 41 and 353 are both prime, and there are exactly 353 squarefree numbers among 1, ..., (41-1)/2*29 = 580.
