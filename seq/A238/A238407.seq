%N A238407 The (rounded) first geometric-arithmetic index of the rooted tree with Matula number n (n >= 2).
%C A238407 The first geometric-arithmetic index of a graph is defined as the summation of 2*sqrt(d(u)*d(v))/(d(u)+d(v)) over all edges uv of G, where d(w) denotes the degree of the vertex w.
%C A238407 The Matula number of a rooted tree can be defined in the following recursive manner: to the one-vertex tree there corresponds the number 1; to a tree T with root degree 1 there corresponds the t-th prime number, where t is the Matula  number of the tree obtained from T by deleting the edge emanating from the root; to a tree T with root degree m>=2 there corresponds the product of the Matula numbers of the m branches of T.

%F A238407 There are recurrence relations that give the first geometric-arithmetic index of an "elevated" rooted tree (attach a new vertex to the root which becomes the root of the new tree) and of the merge of two rooted trees (identify the two roots). They make use of the sequence of the degrees of the level-1 vertices (denoted by DL in the Maple program).
%F A238407 In the Maple program, F(n) gives the actual (not rounded) first geometric-arithmetic index of the rooted tree with Matula number n. For example, F(987654321) = 3+8*sqrt(2)/3+7*sqrt(3)/2+4*sqrt(5)/3+6*sqrt(6)/5+10*sqrt(10)/7+sqrt(15)/2; the corresponding tree is the 29-vertex tree given in Fig. 2 of the Deutsch reference.
%e A238407 a(5)=3; indeed the rooted tree with Matula number 5 is the path PQRS (rooted at P). The edges PQ and RS have endpoints of degrees 1 and 2 and the edge QR has endpoints  of degrees 2 and 2; consequently, the contributions of these 3 edges to the first geometric-arithmetic index are 2*sqrt(2)/3, 2*sqrt(2)/3, and 1, respectively; the sum-connectivity index is 4*sqrt(2)/3 + 1 =2.8856.
