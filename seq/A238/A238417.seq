%N A238417 Irregular triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of edges having imbalance k in the rooted tree with Matula number n (n>=2, k>=0).
%C A238417 The imbalance of an edge uv in a graph is defined as |d(u) - d(v)|, where d(w) denotes the degree of the vertex w. For example, in the path graph on 7 vertices, each of the two end-edges has imbalance 1 and each of the other four edges has imbalance 0.
%C A238417 The Matula number of a rooted tree can be defined in the following recursive manner: to the one-vertex tree there corresponds the number 1; to a tree T with root degree 1 there corresponds the t-th prime number, where t is the Matula number of the tree obtained from T by deleting the edge emanating from the root; to a tree T with root degree m>=2 there corresponds the product of the Matula numbers of the m branches of T.
%C A238417 Sum of entries in row n = A196050(n) (= number of edges).
%C A238417 Sum(k*T(n,k), k>=0) = A238413(n) (= irregularity = sum of imbalances of all edges).

%F A238417 There are recurrence relations that give the generating polynomial of the edges with respect their imbalance of an "elevated" rooted tree (attach a new vertex to the root which becomes the root of the new tree) and of the merge of two rooted trees (identify the two roots). They make use of the sequence of the degrees of the level-1 vertices (denoted by DL in the Maple program) .
%F A238417 In the Maple program, IP(n) gives the above mentioned generating polynomial of the rooted tree with Matula number n. For example, IP(987654321) = 3 + 7x + 9x^2 + 5x^3 + 4x^4; the corresponding tree is the 28-edge tree given in Fig. 2 of the Deutsch reference. S(n) yields the coefficients of the polynomial IP(n).
%e A238417 S(5)=1, 2; indeed the rooted tree with Matula number 5 is the path PQRS (rooted at P). The edges PQ and RS have endpoints of degrees 1 and 2 and the edge QR has endpoints  of degrees 2 and 2; consequently, the imbalances of these 3 edges are 0, 1, 1, and IP(5) = 1 + 2x.
