%e A238752 For n<=4, label nodes with the partitions of n for convenience.
%e A238752 At n=5, the two possible posets are the Young poset (nodes and covering relations are the partitions of 5) and the poset constructed by covering the partitions (31), (22) and (211) with a common element, then giving each of those partitions another cover, and leaving all other nodes the same.
