%N A238701 Number of primes p < n with q = floor((n-p)/4) and q^2 - 2 both prime.
%C A238701 Conjecture: Let m > 0 and n > 2*m + 1 be integers. If m = 1 and 2 | n, or m = 3 and n is not congruent to 1 modulo 6, or m = 2, 4, 5, ..., then there is a prime p < n with q = floor((n-p)/m) and q^2 - 2 both prime.
%C A238701 In the case m = 1, this is a refinement of Goldbach's conjecture. In the case m = 2, this is stronger than Lemoine's conjecture (cf. A046927). The conjecture for m > 2 seems completely new. We view the conjecture as a natural extension of Goldbach's conjecture.

%e A238701 a(11) = 2 since 2, floor((11-2)/4)= 2 and 2^2 - 2 are all prime, and 3, floor((11-3)/4) = 2 and 2^2 - 2 are all prime.
