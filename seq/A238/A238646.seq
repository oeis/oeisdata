%N A238646 Number of primes p < n such that the number of squarefree numbers among 1, ..., n-p is prime.
%C A238646 Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n > 3, and a(n) = 1 only for n = 4, 10, 12, 14, 16, 24, 36.
%C A238646 This is analog of the conjecture in A237705 for squarefree numbers.
%C A238646 We have verified the conjecture for n up to 60000.

%e A238646 a(10) = 1 since 7 and 3 are both prime, and there are exactly 3 squarefree numbers among 1, ..., 10-7.
%e A238646 a(36) = 1 since 17 and 13 are both prime, and there are exactly 13 squarefree numbers among 1, ..., 36-17 (namely, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19).
