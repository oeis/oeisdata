%N A342803 Primes p whose palindromization A082216(p) is a square or higher power.
%C A342803 Palindromization is the function that minimally extends the string representation of a number into a palindrome (see A082216).
%C A342803 Are 13 and 1367 the unique terms leading to cubes or higher powers?
%C A342803 It seems that 13 is the unique prime whose even palindromization (the concatenation of a number and its reversal) is a square or higher power).
%C A342803 The next term (if it exists) is greater than 10^17.
