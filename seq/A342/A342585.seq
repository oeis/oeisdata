%N A342585 Inventory sequence: record the number of zeros thus far in the sequence, then the number of ones thus far, then the number of twos thus far and so on, until a zero is recorded; the inventory then starts again, recording the number of zeros.
%C A342585 To get started we ask: how many zero terms are there? Since there are no terms in the sequence yet, we record a '0', and having recorded a '0', we begin again: How many zero terms are there? There is now one 0, so we record a '1' and continue. How many 1's are there? There's currently one '1' in the sequence, so we record a '1' and continue. How many 2's are there? There are no 2's yet, so we record a '0', and having recorded a 0, we begin again with the question "how many zero terms are there?" And so on.
%C A342585 a(46) = 0 because no 8's appear before it; but note a higher number, namely 9, has appeared. - _Michael S. Branicky_, Mar 16 2021
%C A342585 A similar situation occurs at n=124, where 14 has not yet appeared in the sequence, although 15 has appeared.
%C A342585 Reminiscent of Van Eck's sequence A181391. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, May 02 2021
%C A342585 From _Jan Ritsema van Eck_, May 02 2021: (Start)
%C A342585 The first 1000 terms seem to grow more or less in saw-tooth fashion with the largest terms (= the number of 0's), as well as the distance between the 0's, both approximately equal to the inverse triangular numbers A003056 (see attached graph #1).
%C A342585 But the picture changes when we go out to 10000 terms. Around the 1700th term, the 1's become more frequent than the 0's and the largest values are consistently somewhat larger than the inverse triangular numbers. Around the 2500th term the 2's become the most frequent number. Also after some 4000 terms, the largest values become much larger than the inverse triangular numbers. See graph #2. (End)
%C A342585 Comment on the colored plot of the first 1000467 terms, from _Hans Havermann_, May 02 2021: (Start)
%C A342585 If one is drawing a points-joined graph, it will obscure some of the inherent large-number dynamics. To get around that, this plot joins the points with a green line, superimposing the actual points in blue. This plot was created by Mathematica.
%C A342585 Your browser will likely compress the very large image to window size, so click on it to expand.
%C A342585 The points fall into linear features of the various counts of the various integers. The count for each integer changes as we move towards infinity and hence crosses over (changes place with) other counts unpredictably.
%C A342585 I decided to chart (see the blue text) the twenty largest counts at the rightmost spike which runs from the zero at 997010 to the zero at 1000467. These largest values are for the counts of integers 2 to 21 and appear at a(997013) for the 2-count; a(997014) for the 3-count, ..., and a(997032) for the 21-count.
%C A342585 The counts are 15275, 26832, 40162, 48539, 56364, 54372, 53393, 43588, 37288, 27396, 22425, 16735, 13099, 11460, 9466, 8386, 7191, 6478, 5777, and 5208, respectively. In my text they are sorted largest-to-smallest and written "count @ integer-being-counted": 56364 @ 6, 54372 @ 7, 53393 @ 8, 48539 @ 5, ... 5208 @ 21. (End)
%C A342585 A useful view may be gained by plotting the sequence against itself with an offset. Using the "Plot 2" link in the web page footer, enter "A342585" as sequences 1 and 2. Select "Plot Seq2(n+shift) vs Seq1(n)" and "Draw line segments". Start with "1" as the shift. The sequence appears somewhat like a fan, the first 4 or 5 sectors showing clearly, later sectors overlying each other. Larger shift values effectively compress early sectors into the vertical axis, making later sectors more visible. - _Peter Munn_, May 08 2021
%C A342585 For a version where a row ends not at the first zero, but rather at the last zero, see A347317. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Sep 10 2021
%C A342585 For n around 2.5*10^9, the upper envelope of the sequence seems to be growing roughly like n/50, or maybe like O(n/log(n)). - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Feb 10 2023
