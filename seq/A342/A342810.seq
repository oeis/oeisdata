%N A342810 Numbers k that divide the smallest number whose sum of digits is k.
%C A342810 By definition, if k divides A051885(k), then k is a term of this sequence.
%C A342810 From _Ruediger Jehn_, Jun 17 2021: (Start)
%C A342810 None of the terms is divisible by 2*5*11*13.
%C A342810 If a term x has the form 3^m * y where m > 1 (which is the case for the overwhelming number of terms of this sequence), then all prime factors of y are terms of A066364.
%C A342810 If a term x has the form 3^m * p * q where m > 1, where p is a term of A066364 and where q is the product of all other factors of the prime factorization of x, then all numbers 3^m * p^i * q are also terms for any integer i. (End)
