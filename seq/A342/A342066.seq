%N A342066 Primes p such that p^10 - 1 has 256 divisors.
%C A342066 Conjecture: sequence is infinite.
%C A342066 The only primes p such that p^10 - 1 has fewer than A309906(10)=256 divisors are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 43.
%C A342066 p^10 - 1 = (p-1)*(p+1)*(p^4 - p^3 + p^2 - p + 1)*(p^4 + p^3 + p^2 + p + 1). For every p > 11, one of these five factors is divisible by 11; one of p-1 and p+1 is divisible by 3; and p-1 and p+1 are consecutive even numbers, so one of them is divisible by 4 and their product is divisible by 8; thus, p^10 - 1 is divisible by 2^3 * 3 * 11.
%C A342066 For every term p with the exception of a(1)=1187, p^10 - 1 is of the form 2^3 * 3 * 11 * q * r * s * t, where q, r, s, and t are distinct primes > 11.
%e A342066 For p = a(1) = 1187, p^10 - 1 = 2^3 * 3^3 * 11 * 593 * 1983522604541 * 1986867499321;
%e A342066 for p = a(2) = 4723, p^10 - 1 = 2^3 * 3 * 11 * 787 * 1181 * 45245048697451 * 497484826300381.
