%N A341843 Number of sexy consecutive prime pairs below 2^n.
%C A341843 a(n) is the number of pairs of consecutive sexy primes {A023201, A046117} less than 2^n.
%C A341843 For each n from 9 through 48, the most frequently occurring difference between consecutive primes is 6. On p. 108 of the article by Odlyzko et al., the authors estimate that around n=117, the jumping champion (i.e., the most frequently occurring difference between consecutive primes) becomes 30, and around n=1412 it becomes 210. Successive jumping champions are conjecturaly the primorial numbers A002110.
%C A341843 Data for n >= 15 taken from Marek Wolf's prime gaps computation.
%C A341843 For the number of pairs of consecutive primes below 10^n having a difference of 6, see A093738.
%C A341843 For the number of sexy primes less than 10^n, see A080841.
%C A341843 There are 8 known cases in which a power of 2 falls between the members of the sexy consecutive prime pair (see A220951), but if a pair (p, p+6) is such that p < 2^n < p+6, that pair is not counted in a(n).
