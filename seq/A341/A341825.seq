%N A341825 Number of finite groups G with |Aut(G)| = n.
%C A341825 The smallest odd index n > 1 for which a(n) > 0 is 2187 = 3^7 (see A340521).
%C A341825 There exist even indices n that are not values taken by totient function phi (A002202) for which a(n) > 0. For example, John Bray has produced a group G that is the semidirect product 19:9 of order 3^2*19 = 171 such that |Aut(G)| = 1026 = 2*3^3*19.

%F A341825 a(2) = 3, a(p) = 0 if p odd prime.
%F A341825 a(A002202(n)) > 0, since |Aut(C_n)| = phi(n).
%e A341825 a(6) = 6, because there are six groups G with |Aut(G)| = 6. Four  cyclic groups: Aut(C_7) = Aut(C_9) = Aut(C_14) = Aut(C_18) ~~ C_6, and also Aut(C_2 x C_2) = Aut(S_3) ~~ S_3, where ~~ stands for “isomorphic to”. - _Bernard Schott_, Mar 02 2021
%e A341825 a(8) = 7, because there are seven groups G with |Aut(G)| = 8.
