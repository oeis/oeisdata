%N A341823 Number of finite groups G with |Aut(G)| = 2^n.
%C A341823 This sequence is infinite, but the amount of computation needed to consider the large number of groups of order 2^8 suggests it may be hard to find the next term.

%e A341823 a(3) = 7, because there are seven finite groups G with |Aut(G)| = 8. Four cyclic groups: Aut(C_15) = Aut(C_16) = Aut(C_20) = Aut(C_30) ~~ C_4 x C_2, also Aut(C_4 x C_2) = Aut(D_4) ~~ D_4, with D_4 is the dihedral group of the square, finally Aut(C_24) ~~ C_2 x C_2 x C_2 = (C_2)^3 where ~~ stands for "isomorphic to". - _Bernard Schott_, Mar 04 2021
