%N A341858 Numbers k such that psi(k^2) = k, psi = A002322; indices of 1 in A341857.
%C A341858 For all k we have k divides psi(k^2). This sequence gives those k such that the quotient is 1.
%C A341858 Apart from 5 exceptional terms, every term is the product of 4 and distinct odd primes. The exceptional terms are precisely the 5 terms in A014117.
%C A341858 Except for k = 1, 2, 6, 42, 1806, k is a term if and only if k = 4*(p_1)*(p_2)*...*(p_m), where p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m are odd primes, (p_i)-1 | 4*(p_1)*(p_2)*...*(p_(i-1)) for all 1 <= i <= m.
%C A341858 The LCM of two terms is again in this sequence.
%C A341858 Is this sequence infinite? If this sequence is finite, it means that there exists a term of the form k = 4*(p_1)*(p_2)*...*(p_s), where p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_s are odd primes such that: for every (e_0, e_1, ..., e_s) in {0, 1}^(s+1), 2^((e_0)+1)*(p_1)^(e_1)*(p_2)^(e_2)*...*(p_s)^(e_s)+1 is either composite or equal to some p_i. That term must be divisible by all other terms, since there are no more odd primes q other than p_1, p_2, ..., p_s such that q-1 | k.

%e A341858 1092 = 4 * 3 * 7 * 13 is a term since 3-1 | 4, 7-1 | 4*3 and 13-1 | 4*3*7. Indeed, we have psi(1092^2) = 1092.
%e A341858 5060 = 4 * 5 * 11 * 23 is a term since 5-1 | 4, 11-1 | 4*5 and 23-1 | 4*5*11.
