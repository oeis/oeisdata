%N A341941 T(n,k) is the number of unlabeled even graphs with n vertices and k edges; irregular triangular array T read by rows (n >= 0, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2).
%C A341941 Even graphs are colloquially known as Euler graphs (even though, strictly speaking, that is not correct).
%C A341941 Robinson (1969, Section 4, p. 153) actually calculates the o.g.f. of row n=6 of this irregular triangle T(n,k), but he is discouraged by the asymmetry of the coefficients of the polynomial. (The n-th row of this triangle T(n,k) is symmetric only when n is odd). He states: "The processes of Section 1 can be extended brutally to accommodate the line [edge] parameter, but the result does not promise to be pleasing."

%F A341941 Conjecture (due to _Peter Luschny_): Sum_{k=0}^{n*(n-1)/2} (-1)^k*T(n,k) = A263626(n).
%F A341941 T(n,k) = T(n,n*(n-1)/2 - k) when n is odd (because the complement of an even graph is even when n is odd).
%F A341941 T(n,n*(n-1)/2) = 1 if n is odd.
%F A341941 T(n,n*(n-2)/2) = 1 while T(n,k) = 0 for n*(n-2)/2 + 1 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2 when n is even (because an even graph with an even n number of vertices can have at most n*(n-2)/2 edges).
%F A341941 Write an integer partition a of n into frequency or multiplicity notation: a = Sum_{i=1}^n i*a[i], where 0 <= a[i] <= n for i = 1..n. Following Liskovec (1970, p. 39), let a! = Product_{i=1}^n a[i]! and pi(a) = Product_{i=1}^n i^a[i]. Let also K(a) = Sum_{i=1}^n a[i] (p. 42).
%F A341941 For an integer partition a of n and an integer partition b of r, let a[i] = 0 for i = (n+1)..r, if r > n, and b[i] = 0 for i = (r+1)..n, if n > r. Define a + b = [a[i]+b[i], i=1..max(r,n)].
%F A341941 In the products and sums below, empty partitions are allowed, and empty products are by definition equal to 1.
%F A341941 Define the product p0(a,x) = (Product_{1 <= s < m <= n} (1 + x^lcm(s,m))^(gcd(s,m)*a[s]*a[m])) * (Product_{s=1..n} (1 + x^s)^(s*binomial(a[s],2) + floor((s-1)/2)*a[s])) * (Product_{s even in [1..n]} (1 + x^(s/2))^a[s]) (p. 40).
%F A341941 For an integer n, let alpha(n) = 2^A007814(n) (p. 43). (We actually only need the exponent A007814(n) for comparison, but this is how Liskovec defines it.)
%F A341941 For integer partitions a of n and b of r, define the product p0(+/-)(a,b,x) = (Product_{s=1..n, m=1..r, alpha(s) > alpha(m)} (1 + x^lcm(s,m))^(gcd(s,m)*a[s]*b[m])) * Product_{s=1..n, m=1..r, alpha(s) <= alpha(m)} (1 - x^lcm(s,m))^(gcd(s,m)*a[s]*b[m])) (p. 43).
%F A341941 For an integer partition a of n, define the product p0(-)(a,x) = (Product_{1 <= s < m <= n, alpha(s) = alpha(m)} (1 + x^lcm(s,m))^(gcd(s,m)*a[s]*a[m])) * (Product_{1 <= s < m <= n, alpha(s) <> alpha(m)} (1 - x^lcm(s,m))^(gcd(s,m)*a[s]*a[m])) * (Product_{s=1..n} (1 + x^s)^(s*binomial(a[s],2) + floor((s-1)/2)*a[s])) * (Product_{s even in [1..n]} (1 - x^(s/2))^a[s]) (p. 43).
%F A341941 Then the o.g.f. of row n is Sum_{k=0..n*(n-1)/2} T(n,k)*x^k = Sum_{t=0..n, a partition of t, b partition of n-t} 2^(-K(a+b))/(a! * b! * pi(a+b)) * p0(a,x) * p0(+/-)(a,b,x) * p0(-)(b,x) (p. 42). (When t = 0, partition a of t is empty and b is a partition of n; similarly, when t = n, partition b of n-t is empty and a is a partition of n.)
%e A341941 From _Joerg Arndt_, Feb 05 2010: (Start)
%e A341941 The A002854(4) = 3 even graphs on four nodes are:
%e A341941    1)  o o     2)  o-o     3)  o-o
%e A341941        o o         |/          | |

%e A341941 (End)
%e A341941 From above, we see that T(4,0) = 1, T(4,1) = T(4,2) = 0, T(4,3) = 1, T(4,4) = 1, and T(4,5) = T(4,6) = 0.
