%N A054763 Residues of consecutive prime differences modulo 6.
%C A054763 For n>2, only the 0-residues may arise several times after each other, that is, there are no "2,2" and no "4,4". Let nz(k) denote the nonzero values of A054763(n). Then nz(0)=1, nz(1)=2, nz(2)=2, and nz(k+1)=6-nz(k) for k>1. Conjecture: the percentage of zeros in A054763(n) asymptotically runs to 50%. - _Alex Ratushnyak_, Apr 18 2012
