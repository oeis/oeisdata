%N A054387 Numerators of coefficients of 1/2^(2n+1) in Newton's series for Pi.
%C A054387 According to Beckmann, Newton undertook his Pi calculations in Woolsthorpe during the plague years of 1665-6. Actually, Newton was calculating something else, and Pi appeared only as an incidental fringe benefit in the calculation. Twenty-two terms were sufficient to give him 16 decimal places (the last was incorrect because of the inevitable error in rounding off). - _Johannes W. Meijer_, Feb 23 2013
