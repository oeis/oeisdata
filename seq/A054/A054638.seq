%N A054638 0 if pronounced name of n-th letter of English alphabet begin with a vowel sound, otherwise 1. Different from A074322.
%C A054638 Three curious properties: (1) 13 0's and 13 1's, (2) Sequence is equivalent to the concatenation of its three non-overlapping, consecutive subsequences of lengths 5, 16 and 5, where each of the three subsequences is palindromic (for example, a(6),...,a(21) = 0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0). (3) "5, 16, 5" is also palindromic.
%e A054638 a(8)=0 because the name of "h", the 8th letter of the English alphabet, is pronounced with an initial (long) "a" sound (plus "ch"). Because "a" is a vowel, a(8)=0. a(26)=1 because the name of "z", the 26th letter, is pronounced with an initial "z" sound (whether as z plus long-e sounds (e.g. U.S.A.) or as "zed" (Brit.)) and "z" is a consonant, denoted by 1 here.
%Y A054638 Cf. A048659. A074322 gives another version.
