%N A267856 LB numbers: positive integers of the form m = a*10^k+b (with a > 0 and b < 10^k) satisfying two properties: 1) the set of prime factors of m is the union of the sets of prime factors of a and b; and 2) A001222(m) = A001222(a) + A001222(b).
%C A267856 The name LB comes from the Stanton reference below. These are the initials of a student who mistakenly tries to find the prime factorization of 972 by finding the prime factorizations of 9 and 72 respectively and then multiplying these together. The result is incorrect but close to correct since the same primes and the same number of primes are involved.
%C A267856 A001222(n) = Bigomega(n) gives the number of prime divisors of n counted with multiplicity.
%C A267856 This sequence is infinite: if m is a term, then so is 10*m.
%C A267856 The next term that is not of the form 10*m for a term already listed is 8346672.
%C A267856 Every term is composite with at least two distinct prime factors.

%e A267856 We have 972 = 9*10^2 + 72, 972 = 2^2*3^5, 9 = 3^2, 72 = 2^3*3^2. Thus, counting multiplicity there are seven primes dividing 972, two primes dividing 9 and five primes dividing 72. Since the set of primes dividing n is {2,3}, which is the union of the sets of primes dividing 9 ({3}) and 72 ({2,3}), and 7 = 5 + 2, we have that 972 is a term in the sequence.
