%N A267492 Autobiographical numbers in base 4: numbers which are fixed or belong to a cycle under the operator T.
%C A267492 The T operator numerically summarizes the frequency of digits 0 through 3 in that order when they occur in a number. The numbers and the frequency are written in base 4.
%C A267492 These are all autobiographical numbers in base 4 which lead to a fixed-point or belong to a cycle. However, in base 4 there are no cycles of length greater than 1, that is, all the terms are fixed-points.

%e A267492 1011112 contains one 0, five (11 in base 4) 1's, and one 2, so T(1011112) = 1 0 11 1 1 2, and this is fixed under T.
