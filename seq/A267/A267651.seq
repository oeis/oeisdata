%N A267651 Number of ways to write n^2 as a sum of three squares: a(n) = A005875(n^2).
%C A267651 This sequence is R_3(n), where R_D(n) is the number of vectors with integral components whose length is n in a D-dimensional vector space.
%C A267651 It appears that all entries of this sequence are divisible by 6 and the quotient is odd.
%C A267651 Indeed, for an integer n>0, on the set of ordered integer triples (a,b,c) such that a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = n^2, consider the equivalence relation {|a|,|b|,|c|} = {|d|,|e|,|f|}. We can see that the cardinality of every equivalence class is a multiple of 6. Let the representatives be the integer triples of the form (a,b,c) with 0 <= a <= b <= c. We cannot have a = b = c, else 3a^2 = n^2. If 0 = a = b < c, the equivalence class has 6 triples. If 0 = a < b = c, the class has 12 triples. If 0 = a < b < c, 0 < a = b < c, or 0 < a < b = c, the class has 24 triples. If 0 < a < b < c, the class has 48 triples. - _Danny Rorabaugh_, Mar 17 2016
