%N A267543 Primes p such that 3*p+1 is divisible by the sum of digits of 2*p+1.
%C A267543 All terms among the first 10^10 primes equal 5 mod 6 (verified using PARI).
%C A267543 From _Altug Alkan_, Apr 07 2016: (Start)
%C A267543 Proof is easy. All terms are congruent to 5 mod 6. If n > 2, prime(n) mod 6 can be 1 or 5. If p is prime that is congruent to 1 mod 6, then p is the form of 3*k+1. If there is a number of the form 3*k+1, its sum of digits is also must be of the form 3*t+1. At this point, 3*p+1 is the form of 3*(3*k+1)+1 = 9*k+4 and sum of digits of 2*p+1 is the form of 2*(3*t+1)+1=6*t+3. Since 9*k+4 is never divisible by 3*(2*t+1), there is no member that is congruent to 1 mod 6 in this sequence. So sequence contains only the primes which are congruent to 5 mod 6. (End)

%e A267543 For p=5, we have 3*5+1=16 and the sum of digits of 2*5+1=11 is 2; since 16 is divisible by 2, 5 is a term.
