%N A038372 Largest subset of integers [ 1...n ] such that no member divides two others.
%D A038372 R. K. Guy, Unsolved Problems Number Theory, B24.
%F A038372 a(n) >= ceiling(2n/3). For large n, 0.6725n <= a(n) <= 0.6736n (see Guy).
%e A038372 {6,8-17,19-23,25-29} is the largest set of positive integers <= 29 such that none of them divides two of the others. The cardinality of the set is 21, so a(29)=21.
