%N A038703 Primes p such that p^2 mod q is odd, where q is the previous prime.
%C A038703 The next term if it exists is > 32452843 = 2000000th prime. Can someone prove this sequence is complete? - _Olivier Gérard_, Jun 26 2001
%C A038703 To prove that 127 is the last prime, we need to show that prime gaps satisfy prime(k)-prime(k-1)<sqrt(prime(k-1)) for k>31. Although it is easy to verify this inequality for all known prime gaps, there is no proof for all gaps. - _T. D. Noe_, Jul 25 2006

%F A038703 Prime(k) is in the sequence if prime(k)^2 (mod prime(k-1)) is odd.
%e A038703 The first prime with a prime lower than itself is 3. This squared is 9, which when divided by the previous prime 2 leaves remainder 1, which is odd. So 3 is in the sequence. 11 is not in the sequence because 11^2, when divided by the previous prime 7, leaves a remainder of 121 (mod 7) = 2, which is even.
