%N A038774 Cycle lengths of the permutation that converts the forest of depth-first planar planted binary trees into breadth-first representation.
%e A038774 The first 6 terms add up to 14=cat[4], so the cycle lengths of the permutation for forest[4] are {1, 1, 3, 4, 3, 2}. The sequence as given (50 terms) was generated on forest[10].
%Y A038774 Cf. A038775, A038776. Max cycle lengths: A057542.
