%N A253952 Numbers that require three steps to collapse to a single digit in base 4 (written in base 10).
%C A253952 One step consists of taking the number in base 4 and inserting some plus signs between the digits with no restrictions and adding the resulting numbers together in base 4. The numbers given here cannot be taken to a single digit in one or two steps. It is known that three steps always suffice to get to a single digit, and that there are infinitely many numbers that require three steps.

%e A253952 As an example a(1)=43 which in base 4 can be written as 223.  There are then three ways to insert plus signs in the first step:
%e A253952 2+23   22+3   2+2+3
%e A253952 This gives the numbers (in base 4) as 31, 31, and 13 respectively.  In the second step we have one of the following two:
%e A253952 3+1   1+3
%e A253952 In both cases this gives the number (in base 4) of 10.  Finally in the third step we have the following:
%e A253952 1+0
%e A253952 Which gives 1, a single digit, and we cannot get to a single digit in one or two steps.  (Note, the single digit that we reduce to is independent of the sequence of steps taken.)
