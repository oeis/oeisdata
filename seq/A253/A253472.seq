%N A253472 Square Pairs: Numbers n such that 1, 2, ..., 2n can be partitioned into n pairs, where each pair adds up to a perfect square.
%C A253472 Kiran Kedlaya proved that all numbers greater than 11 are included in the sequence. Outline of proof:
%C A253472 - Show by hand or by computer that it works up to n = 30.
%C A253472 - For n=31, pair 62+59=61+60=11^2 and then reduce to the case of n=29. For n=32, pair 64+57, ..., 61+60 and reduce to the case of 28. And so on. This works until n=48.
%C A253472 - For n=49, ..., 72 pairs adding up to 13^2 allow us to reduce to n=35.
%C A253472 - Repeat the process, always terminating at (2m+1)^2-25, aiming for sums of (2m+3)^2. The first such pair is (2m+1)^2-23, 8m+31.
%C A253472 - This always works, as long as (2m+1)^2 - 25 > 8m+31, and therefore we must have m > 4.
%C A253472 A similar sequence using odd numbers can be created, by making n pairs that sum to perfect squares, using numbers from 0 to 2n-1. All numbers greater than 6 are included.
%C A253472 Worthy of consideration for the elementary school classroom working on square numbers. - _Gordon Hamilton_, Mar 20 2015
