%S A143106 1,3,5,9,17,21
%N A143106 Odd degrees for which (up to swapping of variables) there exists a unique polynomial p(x,y), such that p(x,y)=1 when x+y=1, with positive coefficients and such that the number of terms is minimal (equal to (d+3)/2). There always exists a group invariant polynomial (see any of the references), but for many degrees, other such extremal polynomials exist.
%C A143106 This sequence is a subsequence of A143105. It is unknown if this is the same sequence, nor if this sequence is infinite (conjectured to be such). It is not currently computationally feasible to find out if 21 belongs in this sequence or not.

%e A143106 7 is not in the sequence as there are two noninvariant polynomials with minimal number of terms: x^7 + 7/2 xy + 7/2 x^5y + 7/2 xy^5 + y^7 and x^7 + 7 x^3y + 7 xy^3 + 7 x^3y^3 + y^7. This is beside the group invariant x^7 + 7 x^3y + 14 x^2y^3 + 7 xy^5 + y^7 (and one with x,y reversed).
