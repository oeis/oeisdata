%N A143145 A positive integer n is included if there are no primes p where j < p < k, where j is the largest divisor of n that is <= sqrt(n) and k = the smallest divisor of n that is >= sqrt(n).
%C A143145 All squares s are included in this sequence, since there are no integers at all between j and k because j = k, where j = the largest divisor of s that is <= sqrt(s) and k the smallest divisor of s that is >= sqrt(s).
%C A143145 Also, all integers of the form m = j*(j+1) are included in the sequence, because the two middle divisors are j and j+1 and there are no integers between these divisors, obviously.
%C A143145 The number of terms less than or equal to 10^n, n=0..., is 1, 5, 27, 100, 388, 1536, ..., . - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Aug 31 2008

%e A143145 The divisors of 35 are 1,5,7,35. The two middle divisors are 5 and 7. Between 5 and 7 (and not including 5 and 7) there are no primes (since the only integer between these divisors, 6, is composite). So 35 is included in the sequence.
