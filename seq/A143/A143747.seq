%N A143747 Complete list, sorted, of discriminants of definite Eichler orders with class number 1.
%C A143747 From Kirschmer and Voight, Table 7.1: Definite Eichler orders with class number h = 1, p.26.

%e A143747 There are 3 fields of degree n = 4. With discriminant d_F = 725 (as opposed to the possible 1957 or 2777) we may have norms (D, N) = {(1,1),(1,11),(1,19),(1,29)}. There is a unique field of degree n = 5, which has discriminant d_F = 24217, D = 5, N = 1.
%Y A143747 Cf. A143746.
