%e A143791 21 is binary is 10101. The prime divisors of 21 are 3 and 7. 3 is 11 in binary, which does not occur within 10101. 7 is 111 in binary, which also does not occur within 10101. So 21 is in the sequence.
%e A143791 On the other hand, 27 in binary is 11011. The only prime divisor of 27 is 3, which is 11 in binary. 11 does occur (twice) within 11011 like so: (11)0(11). So 27 is not in the sequence.
