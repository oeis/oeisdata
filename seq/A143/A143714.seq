%N A143714 Number of pairs (a,b), 1 <= a <= b <= n, such that (a+b)^2+n^2 is a square.
%C A143714 Number of cuboids of maximal side length n having integral shortest path going on the surface from one vertex to the opposite one.
%C A143714 Number of subsets {a,b} of {1..n} such that (a+b,n) form the shorter two legs of a Pythagorean triple.
%C A143714 For all primes p, p > 3: a(p)=0 (this directly follows from Sierpiński's proof that one of the shorter sides of a Pythagorean triple must be a multiple of 3, and one must be a multiple of 4). - _Michael Turniansky_, Jul 27 2016

%e A143714 For n=3, we have the 3 X 3 X 1 and the 3 X 2 X 2 cuboid, for which the shortest path on the surface from one vertex to the opposite is of integral length sqrt(3^2 + (2+2)^2) = sqrt(3^2 + (3+1)^2) = 5.
%e A143714 For n=4, there is the 4 X 2 X 1 cuboid having this property.
%e A143714 For n=1,2 and 5 there is no cuboid having this property, i.e., no s >= 2, s <= 2n such that s^2 + n^2 would be a square.
