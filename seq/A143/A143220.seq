%N A143220 a(0)=1. For n >=1, a(n) = 1 if the binary representation of n occurs at least once in the concatenation of (a(0),a(1),...,a(n-1)). a(n) = 0 otherwise.
%e A143220 The binary representation of 21 is 10101. This occurs in the concatenation of terms a(0) through a(20) like so: 1101011000111(10101)001. So a(21) = 1.
