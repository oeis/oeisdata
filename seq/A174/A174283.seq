%N A174283 Number of distinct resistances that can be produced using n equal resistors in, series, parallel and/or bridge configurations.
%C A174283 This sequence is a variation on A048211, which uses only series and parallel combinations. Since a bridge circuit requires minimum of five resistances the first four terms coincide. For the definition of "bridge" see A337516.

%e A174283 Example 1: Five unit resistors: each arm of the bridge has one unit resistor, leading to an equivalent resistance of 1; so the set is {1} and its order is 1. Thus a(5) = A048211(5) + 1 = 23.
%e A174283 Example 2: Six unit resistors: a bridge with 6 resistors yields A174285(6) = 3 different resistances and the series parallel combinations give A048211(6) = 53 resistances, but resistance 1 is counted twice. The union of the forementioned resistances has cardinality 53+3-1 = 55. There are two more circuits to be considered: the bridge with five unit resistors and the sixth unit resistor either in parallel (value 1/2) or in series (value 2). Both values 1/2 and 2 are not counted by A048211(6) or A174285(6), so the total is 55 + 2 = 57. - _Rainer Rosenthal_, Oct 25 2020
