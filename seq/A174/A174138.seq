%N A174138 Numbers congruent to {5,6,7,8,9,15,16,17,18,19} mod 25.
%C A174138 Numbers whose partition into parts of sizes 1, 5, 10, and 25 having a minimal number of parts includes a part of size 5.
%C A174138 For each number the partition is unique and exactly one part is of size 5.
%C A174138 Complement of A174139.
%C A174138 Amounts in cents requiring a nickel when the minimal number of coins is selected from pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters (whether usage of bills for whole-dollar amounts is permitted or not).
%C A174138 For each n >= 0, floor(n/25) parts of size 25 (quarters) occur in the partition with minimal number of these parts (regardless of whether partition includes part of size 5).

%e A174138 As 15 = 10 + 5, 15 is a term since 5 is included and all other candidate partitions have more than two parts. Similarly, as 30 = 25 + 5, 30 is a term. However, 45 = 25 + 10 + 10 is not a term as it contains no part of size 5.
