%N A174533 Almost practical numbers.
%C A174533 For such numbers n, all but 2 of the numbers from 1 to sigma(n) can be represented as the sum of distinct divisors of n. Because the sum of distinct divisors of practical numbers, A005153, can represent all numbers from 1 to sigma(n), it seems fitting to call the numbers in this sequence "almost practical". Stewart characterized the odd numbers in this sequence, for which the two excluded numbers are always 2 and sigma(n)-2. However, another possibility is for 4 and sigma(n)-4 to be excluded, which occurs for even numbers in this sequence. See A174534 and A174535.
%C A174533 Numbers k such that both k and k+1 are in this sequence: 134504, 636615, 648584, ... (A387653). - _Amiram Eldar_, Sep 25 2019
%C A174533 Only numbers <= ceiling(sigma(n) / 2) must be checked if they're a sum as if m isn't a sum of distinct divisors then sigma(n) - m isn't either. - _David A. Corneth_, Sep 25 2019

%e A174533 The divisors of 70 are 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35, 70 and sigma(70) = 144. The numbers from 1 to 144 that can be represented as the sum of distinct divisors of 70 are 1, 2, 3=2+1, 5, 6=5+1, 7, ... , 138=70+35+14+10+7+2, 139=70+35+14+10+7+2+1, 141=70+59+7+5, 142=70+59+7+5+1, 143=70+59+7+5+2, 144=70+59+7+5+2+1. The only two excluded numbers are 4 and 140=sigma(70)-4 as mentionned in comments. - _Bernard Schott_, Sep 25 2019
