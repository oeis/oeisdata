%N A174284 Number of distinct finite resistances that can be produced using at most n equal resistors (n or fewer resistors) in series, parallel and/or bridge configurations.
%C A174284 This sequence is a variation on A153588, which uses only series and parallel combinations. The circuits with exactly n unit resistors are counted by A174283, so this sequence counts the union of the sets, which are counted by A174283(k), k <= n. - _Rainer Rosenthal_, Oct 27 2020
%C A174284 For n = 0 the resistance is infinite, therefore the number of finite resistances is a(0) = 0. Sequence A180414 counts all resistances (including infinity) and so has A180414(0) = 1 and A180414(n) = a(n) + 1 for all n up to n = 7. For n > 7 the networks get more complex, producing more resistance values, so A180414(n) > a(n) + 1. - _Rainer Rosenthal_, Feb 13 2021

%e A174284 Since a bridge circuit requires a minimum of five resistors, the first four terms coincide with A153588. The fifth term also coincides since the set corresponding to five resistors for the bridge, i.e. {1}, is already obtained in the fourth set corresponding to the fourth term in A153588.
