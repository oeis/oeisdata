%N A170899 Triangle read by rows, obtained by subtracting 1 from the terms of A170898 and dividing by 2.
%C A170899 This sequence is essentially the number of cells that are turned ON at the n-th generation of a 30-degree sector of the hexagonal Ulam-Warburton cellular automaton in A151723. The cells on the six main diagonals are ignored, and the resulting counts have been divided by 12. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Mar 13 2021
%C A170899 Row k has 2^k terms.
%C A170899 It would be nice to have a formula or recurrence for any of A170899, A342272-A342278, or any nontrivial relation between them. This might help to understand the fractal structure of the mysterious hexagonal Ulam-Warburton cellular automaton A151723. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Mar 14 2021
%C A170899 It appears that this may also be regarded as a tetrahedron E(m,i,j), m>=0, i>=0, j>=0, in which the slice m is a triangle read by rows: R(i,j) in which row i has length A011782(i). - _Omar E. Pol_, Feb 13 2013
%C A170899 It appears that in the slice m (of the tetrahedron mentioned above) the differences between the first 2^(m-3) elements of row m-1 and the first 2^(m-3) elements of row m give the first 2^(m-3) elements of A169787, if m >= 3. Also it appears that the right border of slice m gives the first m powers of 2 together with 0. See the second arrangement in Example section. - _Omar E. Pol_, Mar 16 2013
