%N A074296 First occurrence of the smallest value subsequence of length n in the Kolakoski sequence (A000002).
%C A074296 The sequence of minimal sums begins 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 21, ...
%e A074296 a(3) = 3 because the Kolakoski sequence starting at position 3 is 2, 1, 1, which sums to 4, which is the smallest possible sum of 3 consecutive terms.
%e A074296 a(8) = 10 because the Kolakoski sequence starting at position 10 is 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, which sums to 11, which is the smallest possible sum of 8 consecutive values in the Kolakoski sequence. Note that we cannot find a sequence of length eight with a sum of 10 because it would have to be of the form 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, which would mean that 2, 1, 2, 1, 2 would have to appear earlier in the sequence, which would mean that 1, 1, 1 would have to appear even earlier in the sequence, which is impossible.
%Y A074296 Cf. A000002, A074297, A074298.
