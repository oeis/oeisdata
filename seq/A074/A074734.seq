%N A074734 T(n,k)= count of differences between standard sort and 'modular sort' over all subsets of k integers chosen from n. Modular Sort considers the integers 1..n to lie on a circle and rotates them to exclude the largest interval.
%C A074734 for modulo 24, imagine you need to be present at work at 23:00 and at 04:00, then you only have to be there for 5 hours, not 19 (=23-4).
%e A074734 T(4,3)=2 because modsort mod 4 on {{1,2,3},{1,2,4},{1,3,4},{2,3,4}} produces {{1,2,3},{4,1,2},{3,4,1},{2,3,4}} with 2 changes. modsort on {1,2,4} gives {4,1,2} since it has intervals (4 to 1 gives 1) and (1 to 2 gives 1), while (2 to 4 gives 2) is excluded.
