%e A152682 a(4)=11 because when forming an edge-magic injection of K_4 we must use at least the first 10 natural numbers {1,2,...10} since K_4 has a total of 10 vertices and edges. However this is not possible. But there is an edge-magic injection using the set {1,2,....11}\{4}, namely with {1,2,3,5} as the vertex labels.
%Y A152682 See related sequence A129413 which concerns the smallest value of the magic sum of an edge-magic injection of K_n.
