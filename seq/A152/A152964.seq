%N A152964 Beginnings of maximal chains of primes with eight members (seven links).
%C A152964 For definitions see A152658, of which this is a subsequence.
%C A152964 Terms were computed by _Farideh Firoozbakht_ (see C. Rivera link), who remarks that there are no other terms with prime indices up to 372*10^6, i.e., terms below approx. 8*10^9. The prime indices of the given terms are 321150, 31757516, 134558368, 159849354, 178323284.
