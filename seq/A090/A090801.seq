%C A090801 From _Dean Hickerson_, Oct 19 2007: (Start)
%C A090801 Except for a(0)=1, all denominators in A002445 are divisible by 6 and are squarefree. To test such a number k to see if it's in the sequence, let 2n be the least common multiple of all p-1 for which p is a prime divisor of k.
%C A090801 Now list the primes p such that p-1 divides 2n. If all of them are divisors of k, then k is in the sequence; otherwise it's not.
%C A090801 For example, consider k = 78 = 2 * 3 * 13. The LCM of 2-1, 3-1 and 13-1 is 12, so 2n=12. The primes p such that p-1 divides 12 are 2, 3, 5, 7 and 13. Since 5 and 7 are not divisors of 78, 78 is not in the sequence. (End)

%C A090801 a(n+3) mod 9 = 6,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,6,3,6,6,6,.... (Also a(n+3) in base 9 mod 10.)
%C A090801 (a(n+2)-2)/4 = 0, 1, 7, 10, 16, 34, 70, 82, 88, 124, .... See A002445.
%C A090801 (a(n+4) - a(n+3))/12 = 2, 1, 3, 6, 12, 4, 2, 12, 1, 11, .... Is this always an integer? (End)

%F A090801 We know from the von Staudt-Clausen theorem (see Rademacher) that the denominator of the Bernoulli number B_{2k} is the product of those distinct primes p for which p-1 divides 2k. In particular, all numbers after the first two (which are the denominators of B_0 and B_1) are divisible by 6. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Feb 10 2004
