%N A090108 Values of n such that P[n]=n^2-79n+1601 is prime and also {P[n+1],...,P[n+9-1]} are prime numbers. Namely: a(n)= the first argument providing 9 "polynomially consecutive" primes with respect of polynomial=x^2-79x+1601 described by Escott in 1899.
%e A090108 n=263 provides chain of 9 "polynomially consecutive" primes as follows:{49993, 50441, 50891, 51343, 51797, 52253, 52711, 53171, 53633}
