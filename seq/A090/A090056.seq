%N A090056 Numbers k divisible by at least one nontrivial permutation (rearrangement) of the digits of k, excluding all permutations that result in digit loss.
%C A090056 Trivial permutations are identified as those where the permutation = k itself. Digit loss occurs when a permutation has 0 in the most significant position, which drops off, leaving a number with fewer digits. For example, when k is 3105, the permutation 0315 is excluded because 315 has fewer digits than 3105. These exclusions make this sequence a subsequence of A090055. A084687 is a subsequence of this sequence.
%C A090056 Apparently each term of this sequence is divisible by 3. This has been confirmed for the first 100 terms.
%C A090056 From _David A. Corneth_, Jun 08 2025: (Start)
%C A090056 All terms are divisible by 3. Proof: Suppose a term t is not divisible by 3.
%C A090056 Then for some m < t that is an anagram of t with the same number of digits as t we have m * c = t where 2 <= c <= 9. If c > 9 then t has more digits than m and if c = 1 then m is a trivial anagram of t, excluded by definition.
%C A090056 Since m and t are anagrams, 9 | (t - m) = (c - 1)*m. If t is not divisible by 3 then m is not divisible by 3 and so 9 | c - 1. This is a contradiction since 2 <= c <= 9 for which no c is divisible by 9 which completes the proof.
%C A090056 In addition if t is not divisible by 9 then c = 4 or 7. (End)
