%N A090071 Numbers n such that there are (presumably) ten palindromes in the Reverse and Add! trajectory of n.
%C A090071 Additional terms are 20000000, 20000002, 200000000, 200000002, 2000000000, 2000000002, 10000000004, 10000100001, 20000000000, 20000000002, 20000000003, 30000000002, 40000000001, but it is not yet ascertained that they are consecutive.
%C A090071 For all terms given above each palindrome is reached from the preceding one or from the start in at most 35 steps; after the presumably last one no further palindrome is reached in 5000 steps.

%e A090071 The trajectory of 2 begins 2, 4, 8, 16, 77, 154, 605, 1111, 2222, 4444, 8888, 17776, 85547, 160105, 661166, 1322332, 3654563, 7309126, ...; at 7309126 it joins the (presumably) palindrome-free trajectory of A063048(7) = 10577, hence 2, 4, 8, 77, 1111, 2222, 4444, 8888, 661166 and 3654563 are the ten palindromes in the trajectory of 2 and 2 is a term.
%Y A090071 Cf. A023108, A023109, A065001, A070742, A077594.
