%N A090206 Nonprime Fibonacci numbers.
%C A090206 It is possible to find a run of at least length n (not necessarily exactly n) such that n consecutive terms in this sequence are also consecutive in the sequence of Fibonacci numbers. However, it is not possible for such a run to be of exactly length n if n is even. - _Alonso del Arte_, Nov 23 2010
%C A090206 Some terms of this sequence have prime indices in the sequence of Fibonacci numbers (A000045), see A050937. - _Alonso del Arte_, Aug 16 2013
%e A090206 34 is in the sequence as it is a Fibonacci number and it is composite, the product of 2 and 17.
%e A090206 55 is in the sequence as it is a Fibonacci number and it is composite, the product of 5 and 11.
%e A090206 89 is not in the sequence because, although it is a Fibonacci number, it is prime.
