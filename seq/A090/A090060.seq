%N A090060 Numbers n divisible by exactly five nontrivial permutations (rearrangements) of the digits of n.
%C A090060 Trivial permutations are identified as (1) permutation = n, or (2) when n mod 10=0, permutations of n's digits which result in shifting only trailing zeros to the most significant side of n where they drop off, such that permutation = n/10^z, where z <= the number of trailing zeros of n. So if n were 1809000, the following permutations would be excluded as trivial: 1809000, 0180900, 0018090, 0001809.
