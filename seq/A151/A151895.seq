%N A151895 Number of ON cells after n generations of the cellular automaton on the square grid that is described in the Comments.
%C A151895 The cells are the squares of the standard square grid.
%C A151895 Cells are either OFF or ON, once they are ON they stay ON, and we begin in generation 1 with 1 ON cell.
%C A151895 Each cell has 4 neighbors, those that it shares an edge with. Cells that are ON at generation n all try simultaneously to turn ON all their neighbors that are OFF. They can only do this at this point in time; afterwards they go to sleep (but stay ON).
%C A151895 A square Q is turned ON at generation n+1 if:
%C A151895 a) Q shares an edge with one and only one square P (say) that was turned ON at generation n (in which case the two squares which intersect Q only in a vertex not on that edge are called Q's "outer squares"), and
%C A151895 b) Q's outer squares were not considered (that is, satisfied a)) in any previous generation, and
%C A151895 c) Q's outer squares are not prospective squares of the (n+1)st generation satisfying a).
%C A151895 Originally constructed in an attempt to explain the Holladay-Ulam CA shown in Fig. 2 of the 1962 Ulam article. However, as explained on page 222 of that article, the actual rule for that CA (see A151906, A151907) is different from ours.
%C A151895 A170896 and A267190 are also closely related cellular automata.
%C A151895 A151895 and A267190 first differ at n=17, when A267190 turns (12,2) ON even though its outer square (11,1) was considered (not turned ON) in a previous generation. - _David Applegate_, Jan 30 2016
