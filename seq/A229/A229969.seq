%N A229969 Number of ways to write n = x + y + z with 0 < x <= y <= z such that all the six numbers 2*x-1, 2*y-1, 2*z-1, 2*x*y-1, 2*x*z-1, 2*y*z-1 are prime.
%C A229969 Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n > 5. Moreover, any integer n > 6 can be written as x + y + z with x among 3, 4, 6, 10, 15 such that 2*y-1, 2*z-1, 2*x*y-1, 2*x*z-1, 2*y*z-1 are prime.
%C A229969 We have verified this conjecture for n up to 10^6. As (2*x-1)+(2*y-1)+(2*z-1) = 2*(x+y+z)-3, it implies Goldbach's weak conjecture which has been proved.
%C A229969 Zhi-Wei Sun also had some similar conjectures including the following (i)-(iii):
%C A229969 (i) Any integer n > 6 can be written as x + y + z (x, y, z > 0) with 2*x-1, 2*y-1, 2*z-1 and 2*x*y*z-1 all prime and x among 2, 3, 4. Also, each integer n > 2 can be written as x + y + z (x, y, z > 0) with 2*x+1, 2*y+1, 2*z+1 and 2*x*y*z+1 all prime and x among 1, 2, 3.
%C A229969 (ii) Each integer n > 4 can be written as x + y + z with x = 3 or 6 such that 2*y+1, 2*x*y*z-1 and 2*x*y*z+1 are prime.
%C A229969 (iii) Every integer n > 5 can be written as x + y + z (x, y, z > 0) with x*y-1, x*z-1, y*z-1 all prime and x among 2, 6, 10. Also, any integer n > 2 not equal to 16 can be written as x + y + z (x, y, z > 0) with x*y+1, x*z+1, y*z+1 all prime and x among 1, 2, 6.
%C A229969 See also A229974 for a similar conjecture involving three pairs of twin primes.
