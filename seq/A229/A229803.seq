%N A229803 Domination number for rook graph HR(n) on a triangular board of hexagonal cells. The rook can move along any row of adjacent cells, in any of the three directions.
%C A229803 The value for HR(20) was obtained by Rob Pratt, Sep 29 2013, using integer-linear programming.

%e A229803 For HR(7), the graph can be dominated by the three vertices 6, 11, 26, where we count down from the top.
%e A229803 This graph was called the Queen graph in the DeMaio and Tran paper, but the moves are those of a rook in the classic hexagonal chess game.
