%N A229978 Numbers k such that (2*k+1) + phi(2*k+1) <= sigma(2*k+1).
%C A229978 It appears that the equation x + phi(x) = sigma(x) has the unique solution x=2. It is easy to show that this is the only even solution to the equation, but for odd solutions this is less obvious. The present sequence is motivated by the observation that for most odd numbers, the l.h.s. is larger than the r.h.s. (while the opposite is the case for all even numbers). (See also formulas in A228947.)
%C A229978 From _Amiram Eldar_, Dec 23 2024: (Start)
%C A229978 If k is an odd abundant number (A005231), then (k-1)/2 is a term of this sequence.
%C A229978 The numbers of terms that do not exceed 10^k, for k = 1, 2, ..., are 1, 9, 99, 981, 9879, 98613, 984293, 9850470, 98496984, 985005850, 9850433480, ... . Apparently, the asymptotic density of this sequence exists and equals 0.0985... . (End)
