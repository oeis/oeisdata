%N A350627 Solution to Forest of Numbers (Bosque de Números) puzzle if we start with the numbers 1 through n (see Comments).
%C A350627 Start with an infinite square grid. Each cell has eight neighbors. Place the numbers 1, 2, ..., n anywhere. Now place the numbers n+1, n+2, ..., m in order, subject to the rule that when you place k, the sum of its neighbors must equal k. Then a(n) is the maximum m that can be achieved.
%C A350627 This is similar to the Stepping Stones problem discussed in A337663, but predates it by more than 20 years.
%C A350627 As can be seen in the El Acertijo (The Riddle) links and in _Rodolfo Kurchan_'s webpage, there are at least six similar problems, for example when the numbers are restricted to an n X n square board. All of these are worthy of inclusion in the OEIS once enough terms are known.
