%N A350085 a(n) is the smallest totient number k > 1 such that A007617(n)*k is a nontotient number, or 0 if no such number exists.
%C A350085 Conjecture: a(n) != 0 for all n.
%C A350085 Records: 30 (A007617(n) = 3), 54 (A007617(n) = 21), 106 (A007617(n) = 90), 2010 (A007617(n) = 450), ...
%C A350085 By definition, a totient number N > 1 is a term if and only if there exists a nontotient r such that: (i) k*r is a totient for totient numbers 2 <= k < N; (ii) N*r is a nontotient. No term can be of the form m*m', where m > 1 is a totient and m' > 1 is in A301587 (otherwise m*r is a totient implies m*m'*r is a totient).
%C A350085 Conjecture: every totient number > 1 which is not of the form m*m', where m > 1 is a totient and m' > 1 is in A301587, appears in this sequence. For example, the numbers 2, 6, 10, 18, 22, 28, 30 first appears when A005277(n) = 34, 86, 68, 186, 14, 902, 318.
%C A350085 Most of the terms are of the form prime-1, but there are some exceptions. Here is a list of distinct such instances [not(prime-1), the corresponding least nontotient]: [54, 21], [110, 10450], [342, 29214], [506, 63250], [3422, 100050], [294, 118062], [2162, 235824], [1210, 308660], [930, 395070], ... That is, instead of k being invphi(prime), in these cases it appears that k is invphi(prime^q). - _Michel Marcus_, Jun 25 2023

%e A350085 A007617(55) = 90. N = 106 is a totient number > 1 such that 90*k is a totient for totient numbers 2 <= k < N, and 90*N is a nontotient, so a(55) = 106.
%e A350085 A007617(307) = 450. N = 2010 is a totient number > 1 such that 450*k is a totient for totient numbers 2 <= k < N, and 450*N is a nontotient, so a(307) = 2010.
%e A350085 A007617(637) = 902. N = 28 is a totient number > 1 such that 902*k is a totient for totient numbers 2 <= k < N, and 902*N is a nontotient, so a(637) = 28.
%e A350085 A007617(194495) = 241010. N = 100 is a totient number > 1 such that 241010*k is a totient for totient numbers 2 <= k < N, and 241010*N is a nontotient, so a(194495) = 100. Note that although 100 = 10*10 is a product of 2 totient number > 1, neither factor is in A301587, so nothing prevents that 100 is a term of this sequence.
