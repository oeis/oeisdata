%N A350343 Square numbers k that are abelian orders.
%C A350343 k must be the square of a squarefree number. Actually, k must be the square of a cyclic number (A003277).
%C A350343 Number of the form (p_1*p_2*...*p_r)^2 where the p_i are distinct primes and no (p_j)^2-1 is divisible by any p_i.
%C A350343 The smallest term with exactly n distinct prime factors is given by A350341.
%C A350343 From the term 25 on, no term can be divisible by 2 or 3.

%F A350343 a(n) = A350342(n)^2.
%e A350343 For primes p, p^2 is a term since every group of order p^2 is abelian. Such group is isomorphic to either C_{p^2} or C_p X C_p.
%e A350343 For primes p, q, if p^2 !== 1 (mod q), q^2 !== 1 (mod p), then p^2*q^2 is a term since every group of that order is abelian. Such group is isomorphic to C_{p^2*q^2}, C_p X C_{p*q^2}, C_q X C_{p^2*q} or C_{p*q} X C_{p*q}.
