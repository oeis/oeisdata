%N A350773 Numbers k such that tau(k) + ... + tau(k+6) = 32, where tau is the number of divisors function A000005.
%C A350773 It can be shown that if tau(k) + ... + tau(k+6) = 32, the septuple (tau(k), tau(k+1), tau(k+2), tau(k+3), tau(k+4), tau(k+5), tau(k+6)) must be one of the following, each of which might plausibly occur infinitely often:
%C A350773   (2, 4, 4, 6, 4, 8, 4), which first occurs at k = 5516281, 18164161, 51755761, ... (A207825);
%C A350773   (2, 8, 4, 6, 4, 4, 4), which first occurs at k = 2914913, 9018353, 20239913, ...;
%C A350773   (4, 4, 4, 6, 4, 8, 2), which first occurs at k = 6618241, 81235441, 215206201, ...;
%C A350773   (4, 8, 4, 6, 4, 4, 2), which first occurs at k = 10780553, 45652313, 62198633, ...;
%C A350773 or one of the following, each of which occurs only once:
%C A350773   (6, 2, 6, 4, 4, 2, 8), which occurs only at k = 18;
%C A350773   (4, 4, 6, 2, 8, 2, 6), which occurs only at k = 26;
%C A350773   (4, 6, 2, 8, 2, 6, 4), which occurs only at k = 27;
%C A350773   (6, 2, 8, 2, 6, 4, 4), which occurs only at k = 28;
%C A350773   (2, 8, 4, 8, 4, 4, 2), which occurs only at k = 53;
%C A350773   (2, 4, 6, 6, 4, 8, 2), which occurs only at k = 73.
%C A350773 The terms of the repeatedly occurring patterns form sequence A071369.
%C A350773 Tau(k) + ... + tau(k+6) >= 32 for all sufficiently large k; the only numbers k for which tau(k) + ... + tau(k+6) < 32 are 1..17, 19..23, 25, 29, 31, 33, 37, and 41.
%H A350773 Jon E. Schoenfield, <a href="/A350773/b350773.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..10000</a>
%F A350773 { k : Sum_{j=0..6} tau(k+j) = 32 }.
%e A350773 The table below lists each term k with a pattern (tau(k), ..., tau(k+6)) that appears only once (these appear at n = 1..6) as well as each term k that is the smallest one having a pattern that appears repeatedly for large k. (a(10)=9018353 is omitted from the table because it has the same pattern as a(7)=2914913.)
%e A350773 Each of the repeatedly occurring patterns corresponds to one of the 4 possible orders in which the multipliers m=1..7 can appear among 7 consecutive integers of the form m*prime, and thus to a single residue of k modulo 2520; e.g., k=2914913 begins a run of 7 consecutive integers having the form (1*p, 6*q, 5*r, 4*s, 3*t, 2*u, 7*v), where p, q, r, s, t, u, and v are distinct primes > 7, and all such runs satisfy k == 1793 (mod 2520).
%e A350773 For each of the patterns that does not occur repeatedly, one or more of the seven consecutive integers in k..k+6 has no prime factor > 7; each such integer appears in parentheses in the columns under "factorization".
