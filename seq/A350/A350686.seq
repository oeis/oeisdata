%N A350686 Numbers k such that tau(k) + tau(k+1) + tau(k+2) + tau(k+3) = 16, where tau is the number of divisors function A000005.
%C A350686 It can be shown that if tau(k) + tau(k+1) + tau(k+2) + tau(k+3) = 16, the quadruple (tau(k), tau(k+1), tau(k+2), tau(k+3)) must be one of the following, each of which might plausibly occur infinitely often:
%C A350686   (2, 4, 4, 6), which first occurs at k = 12721, 16921, 19441, 24481, ... (A163573);
%C A350686   (2, 6, 4, 4), which first occurs at k = 19, 31, 211, 2731, ...;
%C A350686   (4, 4, 6, 2), which first occurs at k = 26, 1226, 2306, 12146, ...;
%C A350686   (6, 4, 4, 2), which first occurs at k = 20, 716, 1436, 5636, ...; ({A247347(n)-3}, other than its first term)
%C A350686 or one of the following, each of which occurs only once:
%C A350686   (2, 6, 2, 6), which occurs only at k = 17; and
%C A350686   (6, 2, 4, 4), which occurs only at k = 12.
%C A350686 Tau(k) + tau(k+1) + tau(k+2) + tau(k+3) >= 16 for all sufficiently large k; the only numbers k for which tau(k) + tau(k+1) + tau(k+2) + tau(k+3) < 16 are 1..11, 13, 14, and 16.

%e A350686 The table below includes all terms k such that at least one of the four numbers k, k+1, k+2, k+3 has no prime factor > 5; each such number appears in parentheses in the columns under "factorization".
%e A350686 The table also includes, for each of the patterns (tau(k), tau(k+1), tau(k+2), tau(k+3)) that continues to appear for large k, the smallest such k for which each of the four numbers k, k+1, k+2, k+3 has a prime factor > 5. For each such quadruple, each of the four numbers is the product of a distinct multiplier m from 1..4 and a prime > 5, and each pattern corresponds to a distinct value of k mod 120: the tau patterns (2, 4, 4, 6), (2, 6, 4, 4), (4, 4, 6, 2), and (6, 4, 4, 2) correspond to k mod 120 = 1, 91, 26, and 116, respectively.
