%N A350359 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of distinct positive integers such that for any four consecutive terms a,b,c,d, d is prime to a and c, but not to b.
%C A350359 The sequence preserves throughout the coprime relations found in the first four positive integers 1,2,3,4 (4 is prime to 1 and 3 but not to 2).
%C A350359 A prime term p at a(n) is necessarily preceded at a(n-2) by a multiple m*p of p, and followed at a(n+2) by a different multiple w*p of p (m,w > 1).
%C A350359 The sequence is infinite. Proof: For successive terms a,b,c,d we can choose a multiple e = q*c of c, where q is any prime which divides neither b nor d and such that e is not a prior term. Then e is prime to b and d but not to c, and since it has not been seen before we have at least one candidate for the term following d, which we choose as the least such number.
%C A350359 The definition implies that there can be no consecutive even terms (since then they would not be coprime). However, consecutive odd terms are not excluded, and do occur (eg 21 can follow 25 because they are coprime). Although two adjacent primes is possible, and does occur (a(9)=5, a(10)=7), three is not, since consecutive distinct primes p,q,r would imply gcd(p,r)>1.
%C A350359 Similar sequences with the same coprime relations as in 1,2,3,4 can be generated from any start terms a,b,c,d  with b=a+1,c=b+1,d=c+1, provided a is congruent to 1 or 5 mod 6 (A007310).
%C A350359 Conjecture: The sequence is a permutation of the positive integers in which the primes appear in their natural order.

%e A350359 From the definition a(k)=k for 1 <= k <= 4. a(5) = 9 since 9 is prime to 2 and 4 but not to 3, and is the smallest number with this property. Likewise a(6) = 8 since 8 is prime to 3 and 9 but not to 4.
