%N A350872 Number of coincidence site lattices of index n in square lattice.
%C A350872 A coincidence site lattice (CSL), or coincidence sublattice, is a full-rank sublattice arising as an intersection of the parent lattice with its copy rotated around the origin. It is necessarily primitive.
%C A350872 A primitive sublattice of the square lattice is a CSL if it is square (i. e., similar to the parent lattice) and has odd index.
%C A350872 In this sequence, any two CSLs differing by any isometry are counted as distinct.
%C A350872 a(n) is also the number of ordered pairs of coprime integers (p, q) with p >= 0 and q > 0 such that p^2 + q^2 = n^2.
