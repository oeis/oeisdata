%N A350598 Composite numbers d such that the period k of the repetend of 1/d is > 1 and divides d-1, and d is the first such composite with a given repetend.
%C A350598 This is a subset of sequence A351396, and adds the extra condition that d is included only if it is the smallest value of d with a given repetend; thus duplicate repetends are not permitted. This eliminates some values of A351396 which are powers of 10 of d. For example, 1480 is excluded because although its period (k=3 based on a repetend of 675) divides evenly into 1479, this repetend already exists for a smaller value of d, namely 148, and 3 also divides evenly into 147. 1480 is the smallest such value of d from A351396 that will be excluded based on this modification. Other values of A351396 that are excluded include 3700, 5920, 9250, 14800, ...

%e A350598 33 is a term since 1/33 = 0.030303..., its repetend is 03, so its period is 2, 2 divides 33-1 evenly, and there is no smaller value of d with this repetend.
%e A350598 148 is in the sequence because 1/148 has 675 as its repetend, so its period is 3 and 3 divides 148-1).
