%N A350228 Multiplicative Van Eck sequence: for n >= 2, if there exists an m < n such that a(m) = a(n), take the largest such m and set a(n+1) = (n-m)*a(n); otherwise a(n+1) = 1. Start with a(1)=1 and a(2)=0.
%C A350228 Theorem 1: There are infinitely many 1's.
%C A350228 Proof: Suppose not. At each successive term, the sequence either grows or returns a 1. If no 1's occur after a certain term called x, then the sequence is monotonically increasing after x. It can be shown that the series grows at least as fast as the factorial between ones. Then for some sufficiently large n > x, a(n) must be greater than any term to appear in the sequence thus far. And a 1 would be returned as the next term.
%C A350228 Theorem 2: If a(n)=k, and k != 1, then an upper bound for the number of terms from the previous 1 to the n-th term is the length of the longest factoring of k such that the m-th factor is at least equal to m. Call this f(n). If a(n)=1, then the last 1 is at most f(a(n-1))+1 terms away.
%C A350228 Proof: This is because the term a(n) can be represented as x(1)*x(2)*...*x(m), with x(i) being the last time a(n-m+i-1) was seen in the sequence. Because you must cross at least the last 1 to get to the previous a(n), x(i) >= i. So the longest string of x(i)'s that can exist is one where the i-th factor is greater than or equal to i. The factors are not necessarily prime. The "longest factoring" (f(n)) refers to the longest string of numbers (x(1)*x(2)*...*x(m)) that can be multiplied to arrive at n.
%C A350228 Theorem 3: If a(n) = 2, then a(n-2) is appearing in the sequence for the first time.
%C A350228 Proof: Suppose a(n) = 2, then a(n-1) must be 1 because a(n-1) < a(n) unless a(n) = 1 (or the trivial case that a(n) = 0). It follows then that a(n-2) is appearing for the first time in the sequence because a(n-1) = 1.
%C A350228 Discussion: This is a particularly interesting result because every prime will appear (for the first time in the sequence) two terms before a 2. This is because primes can only be directly after a one, because all other numbers between ones are composite. So primes describe the distance between ones in the sequence. If the prime is appearing for the first time, a one would occur directly after it, meaning we'd have 1,0,...,1, p, 1, so the next term is a 2. I have checked the first 400 million terms and have yet to get an 11.
