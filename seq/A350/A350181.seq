%N A350181 Numbers of multiplicative persistence 2 which are themselves the product of digits of a number.
%C A350181 The multiplicative persistence of a number mp(n) is the number of times the product of digits function p(n) must be applied to reach a single digit, i.e., A031346(n).
%C A350181 The product of digits function partitions all numbers into equivalence classes. There is a one-to-one correspondence between values in this sequence and equivalence classes of numbers with multiplicative persistence 3.
%C A350181 There are infinitely many numbers with mp of 1 to 11, but the classes of numbers (p(n)) are postulated to be finite for this and subsequent sequences A350182....
%C A350181 Equivalently:
%C A350181 This sequence consists of the numbers A007954(k) such that A031346(k) = 3,
%C A350181 These are the numbers k in A002473 such that A031346(k) = 2,
%C A350181 Or:
%C A350181 - they factor into powers of 2, 3, 5 and 7 exclusively.
%C A350181 - p(n) goes to a single digit in 2 steps.
%C A350181 Postulated to be finite and complete.
%C A350181 The largest known number is 2^25 * 3^227 * 7^28 (140 digits).
%C A350181 No more numbers have been found between 10^140 and probably 10^20000 (according to comment in A003001), and independently verified up to 10^10000.

%e A350181 25 is in this sequence because:
%e A350181 - 25 goes to a single digit in 2 steps: p(25) = 10, p(10) = 0.
%e A350181 - 25 has ancestors 55, 155, etc. p(55) = 25.
%e A350181 27 is in this sequence because:
%e A350181 - 27 goes to a single digit in 2 steps: p(27) = 14, p(14) = 4.
%e A350181 - 27 has ancestors 39, 93, 333, 139, etc. p(39) = 27.
