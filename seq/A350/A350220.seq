%N A350220 Composite numbers d such that the period k of the repetend of 1/d is > 1 and divides d-1, and d is the first such composite with a given period.
%C A350220 This is a subset of sequence A351396 with the extra condition that d is included if and only if it is the smallest value of d with a given period. Thus, 246 is included because its period is 5 (repetend is 04065) and it is the first valid of d with this period and, moreover, 5 divides evenly into 245. However, 55 (which is in A351396) is excluded because although its period (2 based on a repetend of 18 for 1/55) divides evenly into 54, there is a smaller value of d (33) with this property and a period of 2 (1/33 has a repetend of 03).

%e A350220 33 is a term since 1/33 = 0.030303..., its repetend is 03, so its period is 2, 2 divides into 33-1 evenly, and there is no smaller value of d with this period.
%e A350220 91 is a term since 1/91 = 0.010989010989..., its repetend is 010989, so its period is 6, 6 divides into 91-1 evenly, and there is no smaller value of d with this period.
%e A350220 148 is a term since 1/148 = 0.00675675..., its repetend is 675, so its period is 3, 3 divides into 148-1 evenly, and there is no smaller value of d with this period.
%e A350220 Note that 370 is not in the sequence even though the repetend of 1/370 is 027 (period = 3) and 3 divides 370-1 because the period of 3 is accounted for by 148; note, 370 is in the related sequence A351396.
