%N A064224 Numbers having more than one representation as the product of consecutive integers > 1.
%C A064224 Solutions to the equations: x(x+1)...(x+m)=y(y+1)...(y+n) with x>1, y>1.
%C A064224 Some patterns are impossible, e.g. x(x+1)(x+2)(x+3)=y(y+1) has been proved impossible.
%C A064224 The early terms in this sequence each have two representations. Is two the maximum possible? The sequence is infinite: for any n, the number n*(n+1)*...*(n^2+n-1) is in this sequence. The next number of this form is 20274183401472000, which is obtained when n=4. - _T. D. Noe_, Nov 22 2004
%C A064224 MacLeod and Barrodale prove that the equation x(x+1)...(x+m-1) = y(y+1)...(y+n-1) has no solutions x>1 and y>1 for the following pairs of (m,n): (2,4), (2,6), (2,8), (2,12), (4,8), (5,10). They also show that (2,3) has two solutions and (3,6) has one solution. They conjecture that (2,k) has no solution for k>3. - _T. D. Noe_, Jul 29 2009
%C A064224 The pair (m,n) = (2,3) produces only one term 210, while (m,n) = (3,4) produces only two terms: 120 and 175560. Terms from a(6) onward have max(m,n) >= 5. - _Max Alekseyev_, Sep 21 2025
%C A064224 For all k = A002378(n) > 2 we can construct a member of this sequence by equating n(n+1)(n+2)...(k-1) to (n+2)(n+3)...(k-1)k. In other words, n(n+1)(n+2)...(n^2+n-1) is a term for all n > 1. Also, as demonstrated in my examples below, 5040 is related to 720 as 259459200 is to 210. So we also know that 6244042313569035223343873483125151604764341428027427022254596874567680000000000000 is a term. - _Robert Munafo_, Aug 17 2007; edited by _Peter Munn_, Aug 20 2023 and _Max Alekseyev_, Sep 27 2025

%e A064224 120 is here because 120 = 2*3*4*5 = 4*5*6.
%e A064224 a(2)=210 because we can write 210=5*6*7 or 14*15. The term a(8) = 259459200 = 5*6*7*8*9*10*11*12*13 = 8*9*10*11*12*13*14*15 is related to 210 by adding the intervening integers (8 through 13) to both products.
