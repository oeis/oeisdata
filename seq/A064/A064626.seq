%N A064626 Football tournament numbers: the number of possible point series for a tournament of n teams playing each other once where 3 points are awarded to the winning team and 1 to each in the case of a tie.
%C A064626 This sequence reflects the now common 3-point rule of international football where the sum of total points awarded depends on the outcome of each match. The classical 2-point rule is equivalent to that for chess tournaments (A007747).

%e A064626 For 2 teams there are 2 possible outcomes: [0, 3] and [1, 1], so a(2) = 2.
%e A064626 For 3 teams the outcomes are [0, 3, 6], [1, 3, 4], [3, 3, 3], [1, 1, 6], [1, 2, 4], [0, 4, 4] and [2, 2, 2], so a(3) is 7. Note that the outcome [3, 3, 3] can be obtained in two ways: (A beats B, B beats C, C beats A) or (B beats A, A beats C, C beats B).
