%N A064942 Decimal numbers n such that after possibly prefixing leading 0's to n, the resulting number n' can be broken into 2 numbers of equal length, n' = xy, such that x^2+y^2 = n (y may also have leading zeros).
%C A064942 If A*10^m+B is an element, then so is (10^m-A)*10^m+B (e.g. 1233 <-> 8833 or 010100 <-> 990100)
%C A064942 Since A^2+B^2 = A*10^m+B can be written as 10^(2*m)+1 = (2*A-10^m)^2 + (2*B-1)^2 the number of solutions with 2*m digits (necessary leading zeros count) can be reduced to finding the ways 10^(2*m)+1 can be written as sum of 2 squares. For the following results, see A002654. Since 10^(2*m)+1 is odd and has no prime factors of the form 4*r+3 the number of ways writing 10^(2*m)+1 as sum of 2 squares is just tau(10^(2*m)+1) (order matters). Since changing the order does not lead to a new solution (2*A-10^m is always the even square and 2*B-1 is always the odd square) and since the trivial 10^(2*m)+1 = (10^m)^2 + 1^2 leads to the ambiguous A = 0 and B = 1 there are only tau(10^(2*m)+1)/2-1 relevant ways. Because of the transformation from A to (10^m-A) every of these possibilities leads to a pair of solutions. So the number of solutions with 2*m digits is tau(10^(2*m)+1)-2, see A064943
