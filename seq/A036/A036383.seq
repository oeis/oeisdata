%N A036383 First differences of odd split numbers (A036382).
%C A036383 The large local maxima are near powers of 2. Compare the differences of connected numbers (A036379).
%C A036383 Densities of connected (A029827) and split (A036382) numbers seem to behave in opposite way: where connected are dense, split ones are rare and vice versa.
%e A036383 177, 183, 189, 195, 203, 217, 259, 261 are successive odd split numbers, so their sequence of first differences is 6, 6, 6, 8, 14, 42, 2.
