%N A036390 First differences of composite connected numbers (A029827).
%C A036390 Observe the high local gaps, which arise between two connected numbers of binary order (A029837) g and g+1. E.g., five consecutive connected numbers in A029827 are 4087, 4089, 4095, 4369, and 4471, and corresponding differences are 2, 6, 274, and 102. Thus the density of connected numbers rises and falls in interval [ 2^(g-1), 2^g ].
