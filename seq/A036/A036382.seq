%N A036382 Odd split numbers: have a nontrivial factorization n=ab with a and b coprime, so that L(a) + L(b) <= L(n), where L(x) = A029837(x) = ceiling(log_2(x)).
%C A036382 All even numbers are split numbers, except that prime powers -- here powers of 2 -- are by definition excluded.
%C A036382 The gaps g(n) = a(n+1) - a(n) are growing up to some local maximum before suddenly dropping down to a very small value and starting a new cycle of growth. The local maxima, distinctly seen as kinks in the graph, are g(1) = 12, g(4) = 26, g(12) = 24, g(30) = 42, g(70) = 48, g(157) = 110, g(348) = 96, g(748) = 160, g(1603) = 192, g(3379) = 446, g(7076) = 384, ... They occur at indices slightly larger than twice the preceding one; every other is of size 6*2^k, k = 1,2,3,... while those in between don't seem to follow a simple pattern and are sometimes larger than the subsequent gap of size 6*2^k. - _M.

%e A036382 s = 39 is a split number since s = 39 = 3*13, gcd(3,13)=1 and L(3) + L(13) = 2 + 4 = L(39).
