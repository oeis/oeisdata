%N A036379 Special connected numbers: minimal and maximal connected numbers (cf. A029827) of a given binary order, i.e., between two consecutive powers of 2.
%C A036379 Observe in the sequence that although the values of 2^g-1 are often maximal marginal connected numbers, this is not an absolute rule.
%e A036379 Between 1024 and 2048 (i.e., in the range with binary order 11) 1139 and 2047 are the smallest and largest composite connected numbers.
%Y A036379 Cf. A029827.
