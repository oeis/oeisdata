%N A346723 Use the cells of a hexagonal grid to represent the algebraic integers in the integer ring of Q(sqrt(-19)) as explained in the comments. Number the cells along the counterclockwise hexagonal spiral that starts with cells 0 and 1 representing integers 0 and 1. List the cells that represent 0 or a prime in the ring.
%C A346723 In this entry we use "rational integers" to refer to integers in their usual sense as whole numbers - they form a subset of the algebraic integers that form the ring, which we denote "R".
%C A346723 The algebraic integers in R (the elements of R) are specifically quadratic integers of the form z = x + y*sqrt(-19) or z = (x+0.5) + (y+0.5)*sqrt(-19) where x and y are rational integers. Plotted as points on a plane, they can be joined in a grid of isosceles triangles or be seen as the center points of hexagonal regions. Adjusting the regions to be regular hexagons makes for appealing diagrams, which we will come to shortly.
%C A346723 (To be precise, we map each element, z, to the region of the complex plane containing the points that have z as their nearest ring element, then map these (hexagonal) regions continuously to the cells of a (regular) hexagonal grid.)
%C A346723 R is one of 9 related rings that are unique factorization domains, meaning their elements factorize into prime elements in a unique way, just as with rational integers and prime numbers. See the Wikipedia link or the Stark reference, for example.
%C A346723 This set of sequences is inspired by tilings: see the Wichmann link. Each tiling represents one of the 9 rings and shows the primes as distinctively colored squares or hexagons as appropriate.
%C A346723 6 other rings (of the 9) can be mapped to the hexagonal grid in the same way. See the comments entitled "General properties of the related hexagonal spiral sequences" in A346721.
