%N A346910 Numbers k such that k and k+1 are both nonprime-powers whose all distinct prime divisors are consecutive primes (A066312).
%C A346910 Terms k such that the distinct prime divisors of k*(k+1) are consecutive primes are 35, 384, 539, 4374, ... These are also terms of A141399.
%e A346910 35 = 5 * 7 is a term since 5 and 7 are consecutive primes, 35 + 1 = 36 = 2^2 * 3^2 and 2 and 3 are also consecutive primes.
