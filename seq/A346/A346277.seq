%N A346277 Primitive terms of A108569.
%C A346277 If k is an even term of A108569 then 2k is another term.
%C A346277 This sequence lists the initial term k_0 of each infinite subsequence of A108569 that is solution of the equation phi(k) = phi(k + phi(k)).
%C A346277 As 2 is no solution, A108569(1) = 1 is not primitive.
%C A346277 Each k_0 > 4 is of the form k_0 = 2*m with m odd.
%C A346277 If p > 3 is a Sophie Germain prime, then every m = 2*p^q*(2p+1), q >=1 is a term because in this case, phi(m) = phi(m+phi(m)) = 2*(p-1)*p^q; the first terms that are not of this form are 4, 1830, 4114, ...
%e A346277 a(1) = 4 because every k = 2^m, m >= 2 satisfies phi(k) = phi(k+phi(k)) = 2^(m-1), and k_0 = 4 is the smallest term of this subsequence of A108569.
%e A346277 a(2) = 110 because every k = 5*11*2^m, m >= 1 satisfies phi(k) = phi(k+phi(k)) = 5*2^(m+2) and k_0 = 110 is the smallest term of this subsequence of A108569 (note that 5 is a Sophie Germain prime).
%e A346277 a(5) = 1830 because every k = 3*5*61*2^m, m >= 1 satisfies phi(k) = phi(k+phi(k)) = 3*5*2^(m+4) and k_0 = 1830 is the smallest term of this subsequence of A108957.
