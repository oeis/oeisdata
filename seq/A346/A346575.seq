%N A346575 a(n) is the number of 6-tuples (a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5,a_6) having all terms in {1,...,n} such that there exists a tetrahedron ABCD with those edge-lengths.
%C A346575 The existence of such a tetrahedron implies the following:
%C A346575 (1) there exists at least one permutation (a_i1,a_i2,a_i3,a_i4,a_i5,a_i6) such that triangular inequalities hold for (a_i1,a_i2,a_i3) (BCD), (a_i1,a_i4,a_i5) (ABC), (a_i2,a_i5,a_i6) (ACD) and (a_i3,a_i6,a_i4) (ABD), where we have a_i1=BC, a_i2=CD, a_i3=DB, a_i4=AB, a_i5=AC, a_i6=AD;
%C A346575 (2) a tetrahedron with such edge-lengths can be built.
%C A346575 Values were computed using a Visual Basic program with two different routines, manually checked for n = 2 and n = 3.
%C A346575 Conjecture 1: a(n)/6^n tends to a limit which is 0.338170 +- 0.000017 (confidence level 95%). This number has been evaluated with a Monte-Carlo test on 3 billion sextuples with random values in (0,1) which simulate n -> oo.
%C A346575 Conjecture 2: there is no polynomial formula for a(n), as finite difference method fails.
