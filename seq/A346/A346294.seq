%N A346294 Numbers with two or more distinct prime factors such that the number and all its prime factors fall on a single straight line when they are plotted on a square spiral.
%C A346294 On a spiral spiral plot the position of a number along with all its prime factors, where the number has at least two distinct prime factors. The sequence lists those numbers for which all these points can be connected by a single straight line.
%C A346294 The first term with two prime factors is 21, the first with three is 273, the first with four is 65793, and the first with five is 6118203. Almost all of the later numbers lie on lines with gradient +-1 passing through or very close to the central 1 square. In general there is a concentration of term on these diagonals; see the linked image.
%C A346294 There are 258 terms for numbers below 100 million. In that range the largest prime factor to appear is for 69672413 = 29 * 2402497, where 2402497 has coordinate (-771,775) relative to the central 1 square, 29 is at coordinate (3,1), while the term 69672413 is at coordinate (4174,-4170).

Each term, shown in its correct position on the square spiral, is connected to its most distant divisor by a line, each highlighted by a square, the divisor's square being slightly smaller. The central 1 square is shown as a white square. The line colors are graduated across the spectrum to show their relative ordering. Note the higher concentration of lines along the four diagonals.
