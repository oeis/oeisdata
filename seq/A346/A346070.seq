%N A346070 Symbolic code for the corner turns in the Lévy dragon curve.
%C A346070 We consider the Lévy dragon curve as constructed using line segments starting with an initial horizontal segment. The left endpoint of this segment is considered the beginning of the curve. Let L(k) denote the k-th iteration. It consists of 2^k segments and 2^k-1 corners. To get the next iteration, L(k+1), each of the segments in L(k) is replaced by two segments at right angles, always placing those segments towards the left of the segment in L(k).
%C A346070 Each iteration can be represented symbolically by a sequence consisting of the integers 0, 1, 2, and 3. One can imagine moving along the individual segments making up the curve starting at the left endpoint. A corner is labeled 0 if the curve makes a right turn there of 90 degrees, is labeled 2 if the curve makes a left turn of 90 degrees at that corner, is labeled 1 if the curve continues straight at that corner (0 degree turn), and is labeled 3 if the curve makes a 180-degree turn at that corner. The Lévy dragon is equal to the limit of L(k) as k goes to infinity.
%C A346070 It makes sense, as Knuth and Davis remarked in their article about the Heighway dragon, to express the Lévy dragon as the infinite sequence of 0's, 1's, 2's, and 3's obtained as each finite sequence for L(k) is extended to the limit. Then a(n) is the code for the behavior of the n-th corner in this infinite sequence.

%e A346070 The first 15 terms correspond to iteration L(4) of the Levy dragon curve. These terms are 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0. The initial direction of the curve is 4*45=180 degrees (due west). The 15 terms indicate that the curve follows the pattern shown below.
