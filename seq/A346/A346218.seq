%N A346218 Expansion of 1/Pi in signed binary nonadjacent form.
%C A346218 The signed binary nonadjacent form is also called "canonical signed digit representation" or the result of a "canonical recoding" algorithm.
%C A346218 It is used to multiply binary numbers by the minimum number of shifts and additions or subtractions.
%C A346218 Multiplication by 1/Pi or, more generally, by 2^k/Pi, can be used in argument reduction in the evaluation of trigonometric functions.
