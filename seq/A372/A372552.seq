%N A372552 Center column of elementary triangular automaton rule 94, starting from a lone 1 cell.
%C A372552 An Elementary Triangular Automaton (ETA) is a cellular automaton in the triangular grid where cells hold binary states and rules are local to the first neighborhood. There are 256 possible ETA rules.
%C A372552 Rule 94 (1011110 in binary):
