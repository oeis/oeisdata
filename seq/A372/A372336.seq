%N A372336 For a positive number k, let L(k) denote the list consisting of k followed by the prime factors of k, with repetition, in nondecreasing order; sequence gives composite k such that the digits of L(k) alternate being smaller than and then larger than the previous digit.
%C A372336 No term can end in 0 or 2; a number ending in 2 would mean the first prime factor is 2, which would disqualify the number, while a number ending in 0 would mean the first 3 distinct prime factors would have to be 2, 3, 5 or 2, 5, either of which would also disqualify the number.
