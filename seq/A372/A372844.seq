%N A372844 a(n) is the number of parking functions of order n for which the fourth spot is lucky.
%C A372844 A lucky spot is one which is parked in by a car which prefers that spot.
%F A372844 a(n) = (5/8)*(n+1)^(n-1) - (1/8)*(13*n^2 - 26*n + 9)*(n-3)^(n-3).
%e A372844 For clarity, we write parentheses around parking functions. For n = 4, there are a(4) = 64 solutions. An example of a parking function of order 4 with a lucky fourth spot is (1,4,2,2); here, the second car parks in the fourth spot which is its preferred spot. This parking function contributes to our count. A non-example is the parking function (1,2,1,2); here, the last car parks in the fourth spot, but its preference is spot 2. This parking function does not contribute to our count.
