%N A372666 Numbers of the form A002110(k)/prime(i); i = 2..k-1; sorted.
%C A372666 In other words, "almost primorial numbers": those obtained from primorials (A002110) through division by one single prime which is greater than the least prime divisor and less that the greatest prime divisor of each primorial (results sorted by size). Same as A077011 constrained by exclusion of A002110(k)/prime(1) and A002110(k)/prime(k), so there are no primorial or half primorial terms. Each primorial A002110(k), k > 2, contributes k-2 terms to the sequence.
%C A372666 All terms are even squarefree numbers.
%C A372666 Subsequence of A077011 and A005117.

%e A372666 Since k > 2, we start with A002110(3) = 2*3*5 = 30 and 3 is the only prime divisor of 30 which fits the definition so 30/3 = 10 is a(1).
%e A372666 A002110(6) = 2*3*5*7*11*13 = 30030 contributes four terms to the sequence, namely 30030/11 = 2730, 30030/7 = 4290, 30030/5 = 6006, and 30030/3 = 10010.
