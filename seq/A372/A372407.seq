%N A372407 a(n) = smallest prime not occurring earlier having in decimal representation to its predecessor Levenshtein distance = 1.
%C A372407 The sequence is a permutation of the prime numbers.
%C A372407 The sequence is finite, the final term being a(10699272) = 8074013, after which all terms with Levenshtein distance 1 from 8074013 result in composites or primes that have already appeared in the sequence. This contradicts the claim that the sequence is a permutation of the prime numbers. The largest term is a(8534782) = 110010155089, while the list of missing primes is 1989961, 2982997, 2989367, 2996453, ... . - _Scott R. Shannon_ and _Michael S. Branicky_, Nov 03 2025
%C A372407 A similar sequence which allows for the removal of subsequent leading zeros after the first digit is removed, hence creating a number which has a Levenshtein distance of more than 1 from the previous term, shares the first 844 terms with the present sequence, but then has a(845) = 929. That sequence is also finite with a final term a(9656503) = 8074013. - _Scott R. Shannon_, Nov 03 2025
