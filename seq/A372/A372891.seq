%N A372891 Anti-elite primes (A128852) that are not prime factors of Fermat primes (A023394).
%C A372891 Union of {2} and odd anti-elite primes p such that the multiplicative order of 2 modulo p is not a power of 2.
%C A372891 A128852 is the union of this sequence and prime factors of Fermat numbers >= 17.
%C A372891 Conjecture: All terms >= 97 are congruent to 1 modulo 8. (Note that every factor of Fermat numbers >= 17 is congruent to 1 modulo 8.)
%e A372891 For n >= 2, we have 2^2^n + 1 == 4 (mod 13) for even n and 2^2^n + 1 == 10 (mod 13) for odd n. As 4 and 10 are both squares modulo 13, and 13 is not a factor of Fermat numbers (the multiplicative order of 2 modulo 13 is 12), 13 is a term.
%e A372891 For n >= 4, we have 2^2^n + 1 == 62 (mod 97) for even n and 2^2^n + 1 == 36 (mod 97) for odd n. As 36 and 62 are both squares modulo 97, and 97 is not a factor of Fermat numbers (the multiplicative order of 2 modulo 97 is 48), 97 is a term.
