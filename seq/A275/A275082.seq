%N A275082 Primitive abundant numbers (having no abundant proper divisors) that have perfect proper divisors.
%C A275082 This sequence results from removing the terms of A071395 from A091191 (which are the two primitive abundant number sequences).
%C A275082 Each term of this sequence will be even (unless there exists an odd perfect number), be a multiple of a perfect number (A000396), and have just one perfect proper divisor.
%C A275082 If N is an even perfect number, then N = 2^(p-1)*M_p, where p is prime (A000043) and M_p = 2^p-1 is a Mersenne prime (A000668).  Abundant numbers of the form 2*N and q*N, where q is a prime number greater than or equal to M_p, will have no abundant proper divisors and only one perfect proper divisor (which is N).

%e A275082 a(5) = 56 = 2*28, since one of its proper divisors is a perfect number (28) and the rest are deficient numbers (1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14).
%e A275082 a(13) = 196 = 7*28, since one of its proper divisors is a perfect number (28) and the rest are deficient numbers (1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 49, 98).
