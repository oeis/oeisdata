%N A275855 Platinum mean sequence: fixed point of the morphism 0 -> 0001, 1 -> 001.
%C A275855 The morphism has expansion factor P = 2 + sqrt(3) - the platinum mean. That is, on average the length of the n-th iterate of the morphism on a word w of length |w| is |w|P^n.
%C A275855 (a(n)) is a Sturmian word (floor(n*alpha) - floor((n-1)*alpha)) for alpha = 2-sqrt(3). Cf. A188068. - _Michel Dekking_, Feb 07 2017
