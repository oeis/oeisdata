%N A275068 Squarefree numbers in A022344.
%C A275068 The final digit of every number is 1, 5, or 9.  As a set, A022344 consists of the numbers m*F^2, where m is in (1,5,11,19,...) and F is a Fibonacci number.
%C A275068 The restriction here to squarefree numbers excludes any of Wechsler's J determinants that derive from rows of the Wythoff array where all terms share a common factor, but there are also nonsquarefree numbers that are determinants of other rows: for example, 121 is the J determinant of row 45 (..., 3, 13, 16, 29, 45, 74, 119, 193, ...). Compare with A089270, which includes 121 and other such numbers. - _Peter Munn_, Aug 20 2025
