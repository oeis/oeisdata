%N A275868 Numbers n tracing out a spiral path in a pentagonal Z module thereby creating a ten-fold twin pattern with relations to quasicrystals.
%C A275868 Interpreted as consecutive steps along directions according to a basis of vectors represented by the tenth roots of unity in the complex number plane, the sequence traces out the path of a single spiral of a ten-fold twin pattern. All points are located on a pentagonal Z module (following the ideas of Quiquandon et al.). The ten-fold twin pattern is unique in that the local structure across the twin boundaries is identically coherent to the local structure within the twin domains. The ten-fold twin pattern is enantiomorphous, depending on the sign of the irrational shift of 1/(4*phi), with phi = (1+sqrt(5))/2 the golden ratio, along a [110] direction of the twin domain's orthorhombic unit cell. The sequence expresses the fact that the ten-fold twin pattern has no adjustable parameters, except for an arbitrary general scaling factor.
