%e A275785 a(1) = 3 because this is the first prime for which it is possible to determine the ratio between the distance to the next prime (5) and from the previous prime (2). This first ratio is 2.
%e A275785 a(2) = 5 because the ratio between the distance to the next prime (7) and from the previous prime (3) is 1 and this ratio has not appeared before.
%e A275785 The third element a(3) is not 7 because (11-7)/(7-5) = 2, a ratio that appeared before with a(1), so a(3) = 11 because (13-11)/(11-7) = 1/2, a ratio that did not appear before.
