%N A275603 The concatenation of a(n) and |a(n)-a(n+1)| is prime. Terms are distinct. This is the lexicographically first sequence with this property.
%C A275603 The sequence starts with a(1) = 1 and is always extended with the smallest integer not yet present that does not lead to a contradiction.
%C A275603 This sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.
%C A275603 First differs from A275604 at a(175).
