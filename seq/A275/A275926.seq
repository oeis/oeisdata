%N A275926 a(n) = A140099(n) - A140101(n).
%C A275926 Conjecture: a(n) = floor(n*t) - A003144(n), where t is the tribonacci constant A058265. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Oct 28 2016 (Changed from an assertion to a conjecture by _N. J. A. Sloane_, Mar 19 2019.)
%C A275926 Theorem: floor(n*t) - A003144(n) is always in {-1, 0, 1}, but the first place where it equals -1 is n = 12737. - _Jeffrey Shallit_, Nov 19 2016
%C A275926 It follows from Theorem 18 in the Carlitz, Scoville and Hoggatt paper that the values -1, 0 and 1 are taken infinitely often.  - _Michel Dekking_, Mar 19 2019
