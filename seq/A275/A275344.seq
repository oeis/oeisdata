%N A275344 Number of ordered ways to write n as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2*w^2 with x + 2*y + 3*z a square, where x,y,z,w are nonnegative integers.
%C A275344 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n = 0,1,2,..., and a(n) = 1 only for n = 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 15, 16, 25, 30, 33, 84, 169, 225.
%C A275344 (ii) For each ordered pair (a,b) = (1,2), (1,3), (1,12), (1,23), (2,3), (2,4), (2,6), (2,7), (2,15), (2,16), any natural number can be written as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2*w^2 with x,y,z,w nonnegative integers such that a*x + b*y is a square.
%C A275344 This is similar to the conjecture in A271518. It is known that any natural number can be written as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2*w^2 with x,y,z,w nonnegative integers.
