%N A275297 Number of ordered ways to write n as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^3 with x + 2*y a square, where x,y,z,w are nonnegative integers with z >= w.
%C A275297 Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n = 0,1,2,..., and a(n) = 1 only for n = 0, 3, 7, 8, 11, 12, 15, 23, 24, 32, 39, 47, 71, 103, 120, 136, 159, 176, 183, 218, 359, 463.
%C A275297 Compare this conjecture with Conjecture 5.1 of the author's preprint arXiv:1604.06723. See also A275298 and A275299 for similar conjectures.
%C A275297 By Theorem 1.1 of arXiv:1604.06723, any natural number can be written as the sum of three squares and a sixth power.
%C A275297 Let c be 1 or 2. By the conjecture in A272979, any n = 0,1,2,... can be written as x^2 + 2*y^2 + z^3 + 2*c^2*w^4 with x,y,z,w nonnegative integers, and hence n = x^2 + (y+c*w^2)^2 + (y-c*w^2)^2 + z^3 with (y+c*w^2)-(y-c*w^2) = 2*c*w^2. If n > 0 is not among the 174 terms in the b-file of A275169, then the conjecture in A275169 implies that n can be written as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^3 with x - y = 0^2, where x,y,z,w are nonnegative integers. If n is among the 174 terms in the b-file of A275169, then we may use a computer to verify that n can be written as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^3 with c*(x-y) a square, where x,y,z,w are nonnegative integers.
