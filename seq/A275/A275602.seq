%N A275602 The concatenation of |a(n)-a(n+1)| and a(n+1) is prime and all such concatenations are different one from another. Terms are distinct.
%C A275602 The sequence starts with a(1) = 1 and is always extended with the smallest integer not yet present that does not lead to a contradiction.
%C A275602 This sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the odd integers not ending with the digit "5".
%C A275602 This sequence is a variant of A275386 and shares with it the first 900 terms.
