%N A262697 a(n)=0 if n is in A259934, otherwise number of nodes (including leaves and the node n itself) in that finite subtree whose root is n and edge-relation is defined by A049820(child) = parent.

%F A262697 If A262693(n) = 1 [when n is in A259934],
%F A262697   then a(n) = 0,
%F A262697 otherwise, if A060990(n) = 0 [when n is one of the leaves, A045765],
%F A262697   then a(n) = 1,
%F A262697 otherwise:
%F A262697   a(n) = 1 + Sum_{k = A082284(n) .. A262686(n)} [A049820(k) = n] * a(k).
%F A262697 (In the last clause [ ] stands for Iverson bracket, giving as its result 1 only when A049820(k) = n, and 0 otherwise).
%e A262697 For n=1, its transitive closure (as defined by edge-relation A049820(child) = parent) is the union of {1} itself together with all its descendants, together {1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8}. We see that there are no other nodes in a subtree whose root is 1, because A049820(3) = 3 - d(3) = 1, A049820(4) = 1, A049820(5) = 3, A049820(7) = 5, A049820(8) = 4 and both 7 and 8 are terms of A045765. Thus a(1) = 6.
%e A262697 For n=9, its transitive closure is {9, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 23, 24, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 36, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 64, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79}, containing 38 terms, thus a(9) = 38.
