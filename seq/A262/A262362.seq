%N A262362 Numbers with more than one factorization (up to association) in Z[sqrt(10)].
%C A262362 To count as distinct from another factorization, a factorization must not be derived from the other by multiplication by units. For example, (4 - sqrt(10))(4 + sqrt(10)) is not distinct from (-1)(2 - sqrt(10))(2 + sqrt(10)) as a factorization of 6 because -3 - sqrt(10) is a unit and (2 - sqrt(10))(-3 - sqrt(10)) = 4 + sqrt(10).
%C A262362 Given a number p that is prime in Z, if x^2 == 10 mod p has solutions in Z, then some multiples of p are in this sequence. If x is the smallest solution, then x^2 - 10 gives the smallest multiple of p in this sequence not divisible by any prior term. For example, 6^2 == 10 mod 13, and 26 = 2 * 13 = (6 - sqrt(10))(6 + sqrt(10)).
%C A262362 If a number is in this sequence, then so are all its real positive integer multiples. The negative multiples also have more than one factorization, but of course one has to remember to put in the -1 as needed. Since Z[sqrt(10)] has units of norm -1, it is then possible to "shop" the units to include or exclude -1 from the factorization.
%C A262362 Z[sqrt(10)] has class number 2. This means that while a number may have more than one factorization, all factorizations have the same number of nonunit irreducible factors. If one factorization seems to have fewer factors, then it is an incomplete factorization.
%C A262362 From _Jianing Song_, Dec 06 2025: (Start)
%C A262362 The complement of this sequence is the set of numbers m such that the non-principal prime ideal factors (counted with multiplicities) of (m) has a unique way to be grouped in pairs. In other words, m is not a term if and only if:
%C A262362  - either there is only one non-principal prime ideal dividing (m);
%C A262362  - or there are exactly two non-principal prime ideal factors of (m), each with exponent 1.
%C A262362 The same applies in every quadratic field whose class group has exponent 2.
%C A262362 Since (p) is the product of two distinct non-principal prime ideals if and only if p == 3, 13, 27, 37 (mod 40), this sequence consists exactly numbers divisible by 10, 2*p, 5*p or p*q (not necessarily distinct) for primes p, q == 3, 13, 27, 37 (mod 40). (End)

%e A262362 9 = 3^2 = (-1)(1 - sqrt(10))(1 + sqrt(10)), so 9 is in the sequence.
%e A262362 10 = 2 * 5 = (sqrt(10))^2, so 10 is in the sequence.
%e A262362 Here the non-principal prime ideal factors of 9 are {P3,P3,P3',P3'}, which can be grouped in two ways {{P3,P3},{P3',P3'}} and {{P3,P3'},{P3,P3'}}. Similarly, the non-principal prime ideal factors of 10 are {P2,P2,P5,P5}, which can be grouped in two ways {{P2,P2},{P5,P5}} and {{P2,P5},{P2,P5}}. - _Jianing Song_, Dec 06 2025
