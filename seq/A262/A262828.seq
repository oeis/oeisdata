%N A262828 Numbers with more than one factorization (up to association) in Z[sqrt(-5)].
%C A262828 To count as distinct from another factorization, a factorization must not be derived from the other by multiplication by units. For example, -2 * -3 is not distinct from 2 * 3 as a factorization of 6.
%C A262828 If a number is in this sequence, then so are all its real positive integer multiples. The negative multiples also have more than one factorization, but of course one has to remember to put in the -1 as needed.
%C A262828 Z[sqrt(-5)] has class number 2. This means that while a number may have more than one factorization, all factorizations have the same number of factors. If one factorization seems to have fewer factors, then it is an incomplete factorization.
%C A262828 From _Jianing Song_, Dec 06 2025: (Start)
%C A262828 The complement of this sequence is the set of numbers m such that the non-principal prime ideal factors (counted with multiplicities) of (m) has a unique way to be grouped in pairs. In other words, m is not a term if and only if:
%C A262828  - either there is only one non-principal prime ideal dividing (m);
%C A262828  - or there are exactly two non-principal prime ideal factors of (m), each with exponent 1.
%C A262828 The same applies in every quadratic field whose class group has exponent 2.
%C A262828 Since (p) is the product of two distinct non-principal prime ideals if and only if p == 3, 7 (mod 20), this sequence consists exactly numbers divisible by 2*p or p*q (not necessarily distinct) for primes p, q == 3, 7 (mod 20). (End)

%e A262828 14 = 2 * 7 = (3 - sqrt(-5))(3 + sqrt(-5)), so 14 is in the sequence.
%e A262828 Here the non-principal prime ideal factors of 14 are {P2,P2,P7,P7'}, which can be grouped in two ways {{P2,P2},{P7,P7'}} and {{P2,P7},{P2,P7'}}. - _Jianing Song_, Dec 06 2025
