%N A211485 Numbers for which the canonical prime factorization contains only an odd number of exponents, all of which are congruent to 1 modulo 3.
%C A211485 By convention 1 is included as the first term, in order to simplify the statement of certain results concerning this sequence.

%e A211485 3 is included, as its canonical prime factorization 3^1 contains only an odd number of exponents, all of which are congruent to 1 modulo 3.
%e A211485 81 is in the sequence, because its canonical prime factorization is 3^4, and that one exponent, 4, is congruent to 1 modulo 3.
