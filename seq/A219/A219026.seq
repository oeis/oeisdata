%N A219026 Number of primes p<=n such that 2n-p and 2n+p-2 are both prime.
%C A219026 Conjecture: a(n)>0 except for n=1,2,4,6,10,22,57.
%C A219026 This is stronger than the Goldbach conjecture; it has been verified for n up to 5*10^7.
%C A219026 Zhi-Wei Sun also conjectured that if n is not among 1,2,3,5,8,87,108 then there is a prime p in (n,2n)
%C A219026 such that 2n-p and 2n+p-2 are both prime. For conjectures in Section 2 of arXiv:1211.1588, he had similar conjectures with p<=n replaced by p in (n,2n)
%C A219026 For example, if n is not among 1,2,4,6,10,15 then there is a prime p in (n,2n) such that
%C A219026 2n-p and 2n+p+2 are both prime.
