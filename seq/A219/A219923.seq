%N A219923 Number of ways to write n=x+y (x>0, y>0) with x-1, x+1 and 2*x*y+1 all prime.
%C A219923 Conjecture: a(n)>0 for all n>623.
%C A219923 This has been verified for n up to 10^8.
%C A219923 Zhi-Wei Sun made the following general conjecture: For each nonnegative integer m, any sufficiently large integer n can be written as x+y (x>0, y>0) with x-m, x+m and 2*x*y+1 all prime.
%C A219923 For example, when m = 2, 3, 4, 5 it suffices to require that n is greater than 28, 151, 357, 199 respectively.
%C A219923 Sun also conjectured that for each m=0,1,2,... any sufficiently large integer n with m or n odd can be written as x+y (x>0, y>0) with x-m, x+m and x*y-1 all prime.
%C A219923 For example, in the case m=1 it suffices to require that n is greater than 4 and not among 40, 125, 155, 180, 470, 1275, 2185, 3875; when m=2 it suffices to require that n is odd, greater than 7, and different from 13.
