%N A219838 Number of ways to write n as x + y with 0 < x <= y and (xy)^2 + xy + 1 prime.
%C A219838 Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n > 1.
%C A219838 This has been verified for n up to 10^8. It implies that there are infinitely many primes of the form x^2 + x + 1.
%C A219838 The author also guesses that any integer n > 1157 can be written as x + y with x and y positive integers, and (x*y)^2 + x*y + 1 and (x*y)^2 + x*y - 1 twin primes.
%C A219838 Zhi-Wei Sun has made the following general conjecture: For each prime p, any sufficiently large integer n can be written as x + y, where x and y are positive integers with ((x*y)^p - 1)/(x*y - 1) prime. (For p = 5, 7 it suffices to require n > 28 and n > 46 respectively.)
%C A219838 Compare this with Sun's another conjecture related to A219791.
