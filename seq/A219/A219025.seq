%N A219025 Number of primes p<n such that 6n-p and 6n+p are both prime.
%C A219025 Conjecture: a(n)>0 for all n=6,7,...
%C A219025 This has been verified for n up to 10^8.
%C A219025 Zhi-Wei Sun also made the following general conjecture:
%C A219025 Let P(x) be any non-constant integer-valued polynomial with positive leading coefficient. If n is large enough, then there is a prime p<n such that 6P(n)+p and 6P(n)-p are both prime. For example, for P(x)=x(x+1)/2, x^2, x^3, x^4 it suffices to require that n is greater than 1933, 2426, 6772, 24979 respectively.
%C A219025 See also A219023 for similar conjectures.
