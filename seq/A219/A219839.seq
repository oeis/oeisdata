%N A219839 a(n) is the number of odd integers in 2..(n-1) that have a common factor (other than 1) with n.
%C A219839 Besides the trial division method which is represented in the first Mathematica program, this sequence can also be generated analytically as shown in the proposed analytic Mathematica program:
%C A219839 Any number n
%C A219839 can be factored as:
%C A219839     n=p_1^k_1*p_2^k_2...p_m^k_m
%C A219839 and the set of prime factors of n can be listed as {p_1, p_2,..., p_m}.
%C A219839 If p_1=2, the odd prime factor set will be {p_2, p_3,...,p_m} otherwise {p_1, p_2,...,p_m}, and p_j <= n, j=1..m. (p_1 = n when n is prime}
%C A219839 For all odd numbers greater than 2 and smaller than n, there will be p_j, 3*p_j, 5*p_j, ..., n-p_j (when n is even) or n-2*p_j  (when n is odd) that have common factor p_j with n.
%C A219839 If we sum this over 1..m, the numbers divisible by p_j1*p_j2 are double counted, and vice versa.
%C A219839 Taking the statistical result of this, we can make the analytic function
%C A219839 i_1+i_2+..+i_m-i_1u2-i_1u3-...-i_(m-1)u(m)+i_1u2u3.... to count up the total numbers of odd numbers that has common divisor with n, where i_(a)u(b)u(c) denotes the number of odd numbers in 3..n-1 that have common factor p_a*p_b*p_c with n.
%C A219839 Such method gives the same sequence in the data. And, a1=Table[a[i],{i,1,10000}] is confirmed equal to the result from the table generated by the trial division method by DeleteDuplicates[a2 - a1] = {0}
%C A219839 To get the first 10000 terms, the trial division method took 48.56 seconds, while the analytic method took 0.84 seconds. This significant speed advantage provides the value of the longer analytic program.
%C A219839 a(n) is also the number of linearly dependent diagonal/side length ratios R(n,k), in the regular n-gon. The following will explain this. In the regular n-gon inscribed in a circle the number of distinct diagonals including the side is floor(n/2). Not all of the corresponding length ratios R(n,k) = d(n,k)/d(n,1), k = 1..floor(n/2), with d(n,1) = s(n) (the length of the side), d(n,2) the length of the smallest diagonal, etc., are linearly independent because C(n,R(n,2)) = 0, where C is the minimal polynomial of R(n,2) = 2*cos(Pi/n) (see A187360) with degree delta(n) = A055034(n). Thus every ratio R(n,j), with j = delta(n)+1, ..., floor(n/2) can be expressed as a linear combination of the independent R(n,k), k=1, ..., delta(n). See the comment from Sep 21 2013 on A053121 for powers of R(n,2) (called there rho(N)). Therefore, a(n) = floor(n/2) - delta(n) is, for n>=2, the number of linearly dependent ratios R(n,k) in the regular n-gon. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Sep 23 2013

%C A219839 This sequence gives the difference between the number of odd numbers in the smallest nonnegative residue system modulo n (called here RS(n)) and the smallest nonnegative restricted residue system (called here RRS(n), but RRS(1) = {1}, not {0}).
%C A219839 This sequence can be used to find sequence A111774 by recording the positions of the entries >= 1. See a W. Lang comment there, and also A337940, for the proof. Hence the complement of A111774, given in A174090, is given by the numbers m with a(m) = 0. (End)

%F A219839 a(n) = floor(n/2) - delta(n), with floor(n/2) = A004526  and delta(n) = A055034(n) = phi(2*n)/2, for n >= 2, with Euler's phi A000010. See the Aug 17 2011 comment on A055034. For n = 1 this would be -1, not 0, because delta(1) = 1. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Sep 23 2013
%e A219839 n=1: there is no odd number greater than 2 but smaller than 1-1=0, so a(1)=0.
%e A219839 Same for n=2,3.
%e A219839 n=4: 3 is the only odd number in 2..(4-1), and GCD(3,4)=1, so a(4)=0.
%e A219839 For any prime numbers and numbers in the form of 2^n, no odd number in 2..(n-1) has common factor with n, so a(p)=0 and a(2^n)=0, n>0.
%e A219839 n=6: 3,5 are odd numbers in 2..(6-1), and GCD(3,6)=3>1 and GCD(5,6)=1, so a(6)=1.
%e A219839 n=15: candidates are 3,5,7,9,11,13.  3, 5, and 9 have greater than 1 common factors with 15, so a(15)=3
%e A219839 From _Wolfdieter Lang_, Sep 23 2013: (Start)
%e A219839 Example n = 15 for a(n) = floor(n/2) - delta(n): 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 take out 1, 7, 9, 11, leaving 3, 5, 13. Therefore, a(15) = 7 - 4 = 3. See the formula above for delta.
%e A219839 In the regular 15-gon the 3 (= a(15)) diagonal/side ratios R(15, 5), R(15, 6) and R(15,7) can be expressed as linear combinations of the R(15,j), j=1..4.  See the n-gon comment above. (End)

%e A219839 n = 1: RS(1) = {0}, RRS(1) = {1}, hence a(1) = 0 - 1 = 0. Here RRS(1) is not {0}(standard) because delta(1) := 1 (the degree of minimal polynomial for 2*cos(Pi//1) = -2 which is x+2, see A187360).
%e A219839 n = 6: RS(6) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and RRS(6) = {1,5}, hence a(6) = 3 - 2 = 1, and A111774(1) = 6 = A337940(1, 1).
%e A219839 a(15) = 7 - 4 = 3, and A111774(6) = 15 = A337940(3, 3) = A337940(4, 1) (multiplicity 2 = A338428(6)). (End)
