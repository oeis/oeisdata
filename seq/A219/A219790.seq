%e A219790 a(2) = 29, the smallest prime not neighboring a 3-smooth number, since 3 is the 2nd prime; i.e., not of the form 2^j*3^k +/- 1. 43-1 = 2*3*7, 43+1 = 2*2*11, so neither are 5-smooth.
%e A219790 a(3) = 43, the smallest prime not neighboring a 5-smooth number, since 5 is the 3rd prime, and 43-1 = 42 = 2 * 3 * 7 is not 5 smooth, and 43+1 = 44 = 2^2 * 11 is not 5 smooth. - corrected by _Jason Kimberley_, Nov 29 2012
%e A219790 a(4) = 67, the smallest prime not neighboring a 7-smooth number, since 7 is the 4th prime, and 67-1 = 66 = 2 * 3 * 11 is not 7 smooth, and 67+1 = 68 = 2^2 * 17 is not 7 smooth. - corrected by _Jason Kimberley_, Nov 29 2012
%e A219790 a(5) = 103, the smallest prime not neighboring a 11-smooth number, since 11 is the 5th prime, and 103-1 = 102 = 2 * 3 * 17 is not 11 smooth, and 103+1 = 104 = 2^3 * 13 is not 11 smooth.
%e A219790 a(6) = 137, the smallest prime not neighboring a 13-smooth number, since 13 is the 6th prime, and 137-1 = 136 = 2^3 * 17 is not 13 smooth, and 137+1 = 138 = 2 * 3 * 23 is not 13 smooth.
