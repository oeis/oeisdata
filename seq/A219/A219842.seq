%N A219842 Number of ways to write n as x+y (0<x<=y) with 2x*y+1 prime.
%C A219842 Conjecture: a(n)>0 for all n>1. Moreover, any integer n>357 can be written as x+y (x>0, y>0) with 2x*y+1 and 2x*y-1 twin primes.
%C A219842 This conjecture has been verified for n up to 10^8, and it implies the twin prime conjecture.
%C A219842 Zhi-Wei Sun also made the following general conjecture: For each positive odd integer m, any sufficiently large integer n can be written as x+y, where x and y are positive integers with 2x*y+m and 2x*y-m both prime.
%C A219842 For example, when m=3,5,7,9,11 it suffices to require that n is greater than 5090, 222, 1785, 548, 603 respectively.
