%N A219016 e-perfect numbers (A054979) divided by 36.
%C A219016 All primes except 2 and 3, and squarefree odd numbers, are in this sequence. [It appears that the author may have meant squarefree numbers coprime to 6, not squarefree odd numbers. - _Peter Munn_, Nov 22 2020]
%C A219016 From _Amiram Eldar_, Dec 05 2025: (Start)
%C A219016 It was not proved that all e-perfect numbers are divisible by 36.
%C A219016 Straus and Subbarao (1974) proved that there are no odd e-perfect numbers, and therefore all the e-perfect number are divisible by 4. But the question of the existence of an e-perfect number that is not divisible by 3 is still open.
%C A219016 Fabrykowski and Subbarao (1986) proved that if there is an e-perfect number that is not divisible by 3, then it is larger than 10^664, has at least 118 distinct prime divisors, and is divisible by 2^117.
%C A219016 If all the e-perfect numbers are divisible by 36, then the asymptotic density of this sequence is 36 * A318645 = 0.31299098... . (End)
