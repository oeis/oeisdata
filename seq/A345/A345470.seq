%N A345470 Number of self-complementary score sequences that are possible in an n-team round-robin tournament.
%C A345470 See A000571 for the definition of a score sequence.
%C A345470 A self-complementary score sequence W is a score sequence of win counts such that W = {s(1), s(2), ..., s(n)} and its complement, L={n-1-s(n), n-1-s(n-1), ..., n-1-s(1)}}, a score sequence of loss counts, are identical.
