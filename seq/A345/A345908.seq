%N A345908 Traces of the matrices (A345197) counting integer compositions by length and alternating sum.
%C A345908 The matrices (A345197) count the integer compositions of n of length k with alternating sum i, where 1 <= k <= n, and i ranges from -n + 2 to n in steps of 2. Here, the alternating sum of a sequence (y_1,...,y_k) is Sum_i (-1)^(i-1) y_i. So a(n) is the number of compositions of n of length (n + s)/2, where s is the alternating sum of the composition.
