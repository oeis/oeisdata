%N A345968 Numbers whose square can be represented in exactly three ways as the sum of a positive square and a positive fourth power.
%C A345968 Terms are numbers z such that there are exactly 3 solutions to z^2 = x^2 + y^4, where x, y and z belong to the set of positive integers.
%C A345968 No term can be a square (see the comment from Altug Alkan in A111925).
%C A345968 Terms must have at least one prime factor of the form p == 1 (mod 4), a Pythagorean prime (A002144).
%C A345968 Additionally, if the terms have prime factors of the form p == 3 (mod 4), which are in A002145, then they must appear in the prime divisor sets of x and y too.
%C A345968 The special prime factor 2 has the same behavior, i.e., if the term is even, x and y must be even too.

%e A345968 29640^2 + 39^4 = 29679^2; 29679 is not a term (only 1 solution).
%e A345968 60^2 + 5^4 = 63^2 + 4^4 = 65^2; 65 is not a term (only 2 solutions).
%e A345968 572^2 + 39^4 = 1500^2 + 25^4 = 1575^2 + 20^4 = 1625^2; 1625 is a term (3 solutions).
