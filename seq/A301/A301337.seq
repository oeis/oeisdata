%F A301337 It seems that for n >= 3:
%F A301337   if n = 0 mod 6, then a(n) = (n/6)*4 - 1,
%F A301337   if n = 1 or 2 mod 6, then a(n) = floor(n/6)*4,
%F A301337   if n = 3, 4 or 5 mod 6, then a(n) = floor(n/6)*4 + 2.
%e A301337 For n = 1, there is only room to search, so a(1) = 1.
%e A301337 For n = 2, the knights search both rooms, so a(2) = 1.
%e A301337 For n = 3, the knights can search the first two rooms twice, so a(3) = 2.
%e A301337 For n = 4 and 5, the knights can search the second and the fourth rooms twice, so a(4) = 2 and a(5) = 2.
%Y A301337 Cf. A300576, A301426.
