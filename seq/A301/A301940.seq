%N A301940 Number of closed meanders with 2n crossings and 6 digons.
%C A301940 A meander together with the horizontal line separates the plane into several connected components. Each component has a given number of edges which is always an even number. The digons (or bigons) are the faces with least number of edges, that is 2. Equivalently, the number of digons is the number of arches between adjacent sites ("minimal arches") where the two extremal ones are considered adjacent.
