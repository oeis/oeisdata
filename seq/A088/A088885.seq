%N A088885 Minimum number of consecutive previous nonnegative integers to n that must be concatenated together in descending order such that n divides the concatenated term, or zero if n divides no such concatenation.
%C A088885 Concatenation always begins at n-1 and cannot go further than n-n (zero). Hence the maximum value of a(n) is n.
%e A088885 a(8) = 6 because will divide the number formed by concatenating the 6 integers prior to 8 in descending order (i.e. 765432). 8 will not divide any lesser number of previous terms concatenated together beginning with 7 (i.e. 8 will not divide 7, 76, 765, 7654, or 76543). a(7) = 0 because 7 will not divide 6, 65, 654, 6543, 65432, 654321, or 6543210.
%Y A088885 Cf. A088798, A088800, A088869, A088871, A088886.
