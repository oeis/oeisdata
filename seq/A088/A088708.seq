%N A088708 Numbers m which are a product of two primes j and k such that m+j-k and m-j+k are both primes.
%C A088708 In other words, numbers n which are a product of two distinct primes a and b such that n+-d are primes, where d is the difference between a and b.
%e A088708 217 is a term because 217 has only one pair of prime factors (7 and 31) and both 217+7-31 and 217-7+31 (193 and 241) are primes.
