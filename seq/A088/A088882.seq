%N A088882 Nontrivial palindromes in base 10 (i.e., palindromes that are not RepDigits such as 3, 111, 22222, or 888888888).
%C A088882 The early portion of this sequence appears to be very similar to the early portions of two other sequences. Note that a(n) = A046075(n) for n = 1..81. A046075 deals with nontrivial undulants of 3 digits or more which by definition excludes RepDigits, but which includes non-palindromic terms when 4-digit numbers are reached. For example a(82) = 1001 but A046075(82) = 1010. Note also that a(n) = A050783(n+10) for n = 1..81. A050783 deals with palindromes that contain no consecutive pairs of equal digits, so although A050783 excludes RepDigits, it includes the single-digit palindromes and excludes a large number of the palindromes in this sequence (such as, for example, all the 4-digit nontrivial palindromes and larger nontrivial palindromes such as 22022 or 61116). A050783(92) = 10101. Note that in the first 65534 values of n there are 754 palindromes, 712 nontrivial palindromes and 42 RepDigits.

%e A088882 a(4) = 141 because 141 is the fourth term of the sequence of base-10 palindromes (A002113) that does not appear in the sequence of RepDigits (A010785).
