%N A088884 Primes which when concatenated with their reverse and decremented by 2 yield a new prime.
%C A088884 It appears that if concat(p,reverse(p))-2 is prime, then concat(p,reverse(p))+2 is not and vice versa. This was tested for the first 60000 primes.
%C A088884 Conjecture: except for 3, all these primes are of the form 6*k - 1. - _Davide Rotondo_, Apr 29 2025

%e A088884 53 is a term because (i) 53 is prime and (ii) when 53 is concatenated with its reverse (35) - 2, the result (5333) is prime.
