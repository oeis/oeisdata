%N A117594 Numbers whose fifth powers are closer to cubic numbers than square numbers.
%C A117594 Numbers which are cubes themselves are excluded as trivial.
%C A117594 It appears that this sequence is infinite. For seventh powers < 10^49, only 2^7 and 3^7 are closer to cubes than squares. Note that 1/2+1/3+1/5>1, but 1/2+1/3+1/7<1. Do these inequalities determine whether there are an infinite or finite number of solutions? Mazur discusses how the ABC conjecture applies to perfect power problems. - _T. D. Noe_, Apr 07 2006
