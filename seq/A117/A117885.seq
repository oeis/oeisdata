%N A117885 Numbers k such that a regular (k^3-k)-gon can be constructed by means of a ruler and compass.
%C A117885 Gauss shows a regular n-gon can be constructed (with Euclidean tools) iff n is a product of 2^k*(distinct Fermat primes).
%e A117885 a(1)=2 because 2^3 - 2 = 6 = 1*2*3, and a regular hexagon can be constructed by ruler and compass.
