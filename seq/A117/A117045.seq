%N A117045 Integers k (not perfect squares) such that the continued fraction expansion of the square root of k has period at most 2.
%C A117045 In a recent paper, Justin Thomas, Julian Rosen, and I show that this is equivalent to the following criterion: let d be the integer part of the square root. Then sqrt(k) has period at most 2 if and only if 2d/(k - d^2) is an integer.

%e A117045 The first term is 2 because sqrt(2) is irrational and for k=2, d=1, 2d/(k - d^2) = 1 is an integer.
