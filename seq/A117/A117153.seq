%C A117153 The precise definition of this sequence seems to have been lost. The sequence stays in the OEIS, however, for historical reasons, because it is mentioned in the "Music" web page, and because we hope that one day the definition will be recovered. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 09 2011.
%C A117153 This is one of several sequence that were listed on my website at the time. These were in large part only posted as examples of simple floretion algorithms with various parameters set and not yet actually meant to be published. The definition would have been very similar to that of A108618. See especially Step 2, Loop 1: Add the fractional parts of the real coefficient basis vectors of x*y. - _Creighton Dement_, Jan 03 2018
