%N A117934 Perfect powers (A001597) that are close, that is, between consecutive squares.
%C A117934 It appears that all pairs of close powers involve a cube. For three pairs, the other power is a 7th power. For all remaining pairs, the other power is a 5th power. If this is true, then three powers are never close.
%C A117934 For the first 360 terms, 176 pairs are a cube and a 5th power. The remaining four pairs are a cube and a 7th power. - _Donovan Johnson_, Feb 26 2011
%C A117934 Loxton proves that the interval [n, n+sqrt(n)] contains at most exp(40 log log n log log log n) powers for n >= 16, and hence there are at most 2*exp(40 log log n log log log n) between consecutive squares in the interval containing n. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Jun 25 2017

%e A117934 27 and 32 are close because they are between 25 and 36.
