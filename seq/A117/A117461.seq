%N A117461 Indices associated with primes in A117460. Both primes and their indices, after calculation of their respective digit sums, bear the relationship that both are prime and that sod(i) < sod(p) and sod(p) is the next prime after to sod(i), where sod is the sum of digits function.
%C A117461 A117458-A117459 is the opposite case where sod(i) > sod(p).
%C A117461 A117460-A117461 is sod(i) < sod(p).
%C A117461 A033548-A033549 is sod(i) = sod(p). - _G. L. Honaker, Jr._
%F A117461 SOD's are calculated for these indices; if they and their associated prime SOD's are both prime and bear the relation in the Brief description above, they are added to the sequence.
%e A117461 a(4) = 30. Its associated prime is 113 with sod = 5; sod(a(4)) = 3. Since 3 < 5 and 5 is the next prime after 3, a(4) belongs in the sequence.
