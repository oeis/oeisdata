%N A117884 Numbers at which the average multiplicative persistence of the interval (0,n) sets a new record.
%C A117884 This sequence seems to be finite. a(525)=9999 seems to be the last term, at a record of 2.282. No higher value found up to 100,000 Is the average multiplicative persistence of (0,Inf) = 1 ???

%e A117884 E.g."39 belongs to the sequence because the average multiplicative persistence of the interval (0,39)= 1.05 which sets a new record. 40 is not because the average multiplicative persistence of the interval (0,40) = 1.048 which is not a record value"
