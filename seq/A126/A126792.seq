%N A126792 Removing the first, fourth, seventh, tenth ... term of the sequence yields the original sequence, augmented by 1.
%C A126792 Inspired by the "decimation-like sequences" (or "suites du lezard", after Delahaye) of Eric Angelini.
%C A126792 This sequence is a generalization of sequence A000120, which is defined recursively by a(0)=0, a(2n)=a(n) and a(2n+1)=1+a(n). Its subsequence of even term is thus the original sequence while its subsequence of odd terms yields the original sequence augmented by 1.
