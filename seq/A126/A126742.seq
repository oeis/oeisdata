%N A126742 Number of n-indecomposable polyominoes with at least 2n cells.
%C A126742 A polyomino is called n-indecomposable if it cannot be partitioned (along cell boundaries) into two or more polyominoes each with at least n cells.
%C A126742 For full lists of drawings of these polyominoes for n <= 6, see the links in A125759.

%e A126742 The five 2-indecomposable polyominoes:
%e A126742 ...................X.
%e A126742 XX..XXX..XX..XXX..XXX
%e A126742 ..........X...X....X.
%e A126742 Only the last two have >= 4 cells, so a(2) = 2.
