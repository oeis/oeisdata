%N A126283 Largest number k for which the n-th prime is the median of the largest prime dividing the first k integers.
%C A126283 a(14) = 1058 is the first term where a(n) exceeds A290154(n). - _Peter Munn_, Aug 02 2019
%e A126283 a(1)=4 because the median of {2,3,2} = {2, *2*,3} is 2 (the * surrounds the median) and for any number greater than 4 the median is greater than 2.
%e A126283 a(1)=18 because the median of {2,3,2,5,3,7,2,3,5,11,3,13,7,5,2,17,3} = {2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3, *3*,5,5,5,7,7,11,13,17}.
