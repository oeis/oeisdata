%N A126009 Self-inverse permutation of integers induced when A106485 is restricted to A126011.
%C A126009 The Scheme-program given cannot in practice compute this further than n=21, as A106485(A126011(22))=36893488147419103232. However, the further terms could be deduced by other means. This sequence is a permutation of the nonnegative integers because combinatorial games form a group under (game) addition and each game has a well-defined, unique negative.
