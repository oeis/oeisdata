%N A126140 Maximum order of a polyomino with n cells that tiles a rectangle with congruent copies.
%C A126140 The order of a polyomino is defined as the minimum number of congruent copies required to tile a rectangle. The order is undefined if the polyomino cannot tile a rectangle. No example of a non-rectangular polyomino is known for which its order is odd.
%C A126140 From _Zachary DeStefano_, Aug 30 2025: (Start)
%C A126140 Beyond a(6), the following lower bounds are known:
%C A126140   a(7) >= 76;
%C A126140   a(8) >= 246;
%C A126140   a(9) >= 4.
%C A126140 There are several heptominoes for which it is unknown if they can tile a rectangle (H. Tulleken, 2019). The exact value of a(7) requires the resolution of this problem. (End)
