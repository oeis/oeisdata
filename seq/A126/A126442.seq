%N A126442 Triangular array t read by rows: t(0,k) is p(k), the number of partitions of the k-multiset {0,0,...,0} with k zeros. For 0 <= n < k, t(n, k) is the number of partitions of the k-multiset {0, 0, ..., 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., k-n} with n zeros.
%C A126442 First in a series of triangular arrays which comprise subsequences of A096443(n).
%C A126442 The second array begins 9 16 26 29 52 92 47 98 198 371 and when the arrays are aligned as illustrated in triangle A126441 with p(n) values they sum to A035310 which counts unordered multisets.
%C A126442 Let t(n, k) be the number of ways to partition the k-multiset {0,0,...,0,1,2,3,4,...,k-n} with n zeros, 0 <= n < k. Then t(n, k) = sum_i = 0..k j = 0..n S(n, j) C(i,  j) p(k - n - i), where S(n, j) are Stirling numbers of the second kind, C(i, j) are the number of compositions of i distinct objects into j parts, and p is the integer partition function.
%C A126442 To see this, partition [n] into j blocks; there are S(n, j) partitions. For such a partition x and for each i, there are C(i, j) ways to distribute i zeros into x, because the blocks of x are all distinct. There are p(k-n-i) ways to partition the remaining k-n-i zeros. Multiplying and summing gives the result. - _George Beck_, Jan 10 2011
%C A126442 Values are also part of A096443, A129306 and A249620. Columns are also columns of the last one of these irregular triangles. See "Partitions_of_multisets" link. - _Tilman Piesk_, Nov 09 2014

%e A126442 This first array includes only the hook cases. A096443(9,14,16) correspond to partitions [2,2], [3,2] and [2,2,1] so these values do not appear in A126442.
