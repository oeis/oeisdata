%N A126313 Signature-permutation of a Catalan automorphism: composition of A069772 and A125976.
%C A126313 Like A069771, A069772, A125976 and A126315/A126316, this automorphism keeps symmetric Dyck paths symmetric, but not necessarily same.

%Y A126313 Inverse: A126314. a(n) = A069772(A125976(n)) = A126290(A069772(n)) = A126315(A057164(n)). The number of cycles, number of fixed points, maximum cycle sizes and LCM's of all cycle sizes in range [A014137(n-1)..A014138(n-1)] of this permutation are given by A127277, A127278, A127279 and A127280. The fixed points are given by A127306. Note the curiosity: this automorphism partitions the A000108(8) = 1430 Catalan structures of size eight (e.g. Dyck paths of length 16) into 79 equivalence classes, of which the largest contains 79 members.
