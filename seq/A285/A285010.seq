%N A285010 a(n+1) = a(n) + p, where p is the largest prime less than a(n); a(1) = 3.
%C A285010 After a(1) the sequence alternates between odd and even numbers (obviously).
%C A285010 There is at least 1 prime between p and 2p (Bertrand), and since there is no prime between p and a(n) there must be at least one prime between a(n) and a(n) + p. Hence the sequence continues indefinitely, and each added prime is added once only.
%C A285010 The underlying sequence of added primes is: 2, 3, 7, 13, 23, 47, 97, ...; namely A075028 or A068524 but without their initial terms (1, 2 respectively).
%C A285010 Four primes occur in the first 24 terms, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 5, a(18) = 196271, and a(24) = 12560153, suggesting a higher density of primes here than in related sequence A123196, in which only three primes arise in the first 500 terms. It would be interesting to examine this further, once more terms become available.

%e A285010 a(1) = 3, the first odd prime. The greatest prime less than 3 is 2, so a(2) = 3 + 2 = 5. Greatest prime less than 5 is 3 so a(3) = 5 + 3 = 8. Likewise a(4) = 8 + 7 = 15; etc.
