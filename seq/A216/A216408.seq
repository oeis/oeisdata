%N A216408 Perfect squares which can be written neither as a^2+b^2, nor as a^2+2*b^2, nor as a^2+3*b^2, nor as a^2+7*b^2, with a > 0 and b > 0.
%C A216408 If a composite number C, in case, can be written in the form C = a^2+k*b^2, for some integers a & b, then every prime factor P (for C) being raised to an odd power can be written in the form P = c^2+k*d^2, for some integers c & d.
%C A216408 This statement is only true for k = 1, 2, 3.
%C A216408 For k = 7, with the exception of the prime factor 2, the statement mentioned above is true.
