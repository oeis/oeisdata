%N A363011 Indices of record highs in A362816.
%C A363011 It is conjectured that only terms in A362815 appear in A362816, and novel terms in A362816 seen to be in ascending order. Does every term in A362815 appear in A362816?
%C A363011 If the conjecture is true and novel terms are in ascending order, then these are the smallest k such that A362816(k) = A362815(n).
