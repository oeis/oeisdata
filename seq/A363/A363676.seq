%N A363676 Numbers k such that the least common multiple of the degrees of the irreducible characters of A_k equals |A_k| = k!/2.
%C A363676 Intersection of the sequences of numbers k such that there exists a 2-core partition of k or k-2 and a 3-core partition of k. This sequence contains A363675.
%H A363676 D. Martin Duro, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12408">Arithmetic Properties of Character Degrees and the Generalised Knutson Index</a>, arXiv 2306.12408, 2023
%e A363676 The degrees of the irreducible characters of A_5 are 1,3,3,4,5 so their least common multiple is 5!/2 = 60, so 5 is a term of the sequence.
