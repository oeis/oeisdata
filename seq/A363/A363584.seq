%N A363584 Lexicographically least sequence of distinct positive integers, subject to the constraint that if 1 <= k <= a(m), then either a(m+k) < a(m) or a(m+k) > 2*a(m).
%C A363584 This sequence was called the Right Arm Reach sequence in a Seqfan thread.
%C A363584 Every positive integer appears, and the index at which k appears is at most k*(k+1)/2. - _Pontus von Brömssen_, Aug 22 2023
%e A363584 Each positive integer k has k "right arm reach". And numbers between k+1 and 2k cannot be within k's right arm reach. We start with a(1) = 1. Now, 2 cannot follow directly because the second position is within the right arm reach of 1. So, a(2) = 3. This step will send 4, 5, and 6 to the "bullpen" waiting for their turns, while 2 can go back to the field since it's out of 1's right arm reach now. a(3) = 2. After that, the least positive integer that's not in the bullpen is 7, so, a(4) = 7. This step will send all the numbers between 8 and 14 to the bullpen. Since we are now in the 3's and 7's right arm reaches, the least available positive integer is 15. So, a(5) = 15. And now we are outside of the 3's right arm reach, so, 4 comes out of the bullpen and a(6) = 4. And so on.
