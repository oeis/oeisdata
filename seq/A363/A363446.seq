%N A363446 Increasing sequence such that a(1) = 1 and a(n) is the least integer such that every segment of the sequence a(1),a(2),...,a(n) has a unique sum of elements.
%C A363446 A segment is a subsequence given by consecutive elements.
%e A363446 The smallest candidate for a(3) is 3, but the sequence (1,2,3) has two segments with equal sums, namely (1,2) and (3). The next candidate is 4 and every segment of the sequence (1,2,4) has a unique sum, so a(3) = 4.
%Y A363446 If we omit the condition that {a(n)} is increasing, we get A101274.
%Y A363446 Cf. A276661.
