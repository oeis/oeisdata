%N A363381 a(n) is the number of distinct n-cell patterns (or quasi-polyominoes) that tile an n X n square.
%C A363381 Consider n unit squares contained within an n X n square. The n unit squares are an n-cell pattern of the n X n square if, when copied n-1 times, they can, with various rigid transformations, be combined to tessellate the n X n square.
%C A363381 Put another way:
%C A363381 Consider, for example, for n = 4, a transparency with an outline of a 4 X 4 square filled by 16 unit squares. Any 4 unit squares are painted the same color. Those four squares are a potential n-cell pattern of the 4 X 4 square. Three copies of the transparency are made with only the color of the 4 squares being different. If a person can stack the transparencies in such a way that they fill the 4 X 4 square, then the n-cell pattern is acceptable.
%C A363381 Put another way:
%C A363381 n unit squares from an n X n square are painted a color. Those n unit squares are an n-cell pattern. If n-1 copies of the pattern can be painted (each a different color) and together they fill the n X n square, then the n unit squares form an acceptable n-cell pattern.
%C A363381 Conjecture by Andrew Young: For an n X n square, where n is an odd prime, there is only one n-cell pattern.
%C A363381 Conjecture by Andrew Young and Thomas Young: An odd integer n>=3 is prime iff there exists only one n-cell pattern for an n X n square.
%C A363381 For any number n, there is always the 1 X n pattern that tiles the n X n square.
%C A363381 For composite numbers n = f1*f2, 1 < f1 <= f2 < n, there is always an additional f1 X f2 pattern. For example, a 14 X 14 square can be tiled using fourteen 1 X 14 rectangles or fourteen 2 X 7 rectangles; a 15 X 15 square can be tiled using fifteen 1 X 15 rectangles or fifteen 3 X 5 rectangles; a 9 X 9 square can be tiled using nine 1 X 9 rectangles or nine 3 X 3 squares (as in Sudoku!).
%C A363381 The second conjecture is a Corollary of the first: If n = p*q is not prime, then there is always a second tiling using rectangles, as explained above. Since the second conjecture implies the first, the two conjectures are actually equivalent. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jun 15 2025

%F A363381 a(n) >= 2 if n is composite.
%F A363381 For n > 1, a(n) = 1 iff n is an odd prime (conjectured: cf comments).
%e A363381 For n = 1, there is one 1-cell pattern because there is only one unit square to paint.
%e A363381 For n = 2, there are two 2-cell patterns:

%e A363381 For n = 3, there is one 3-cell pattern:

%e A363381    | 1 | 2 | 3 |

%e A363381    | 9 |10 |11 |12 |     which is equivalent to:

%e A363381 because the shapes can be created through reflection, rotation, or translation.
%e A363381 Therefore, they are counted as one pattern.
%e A363381 For n = 5, there is one 5-cell pattern.
