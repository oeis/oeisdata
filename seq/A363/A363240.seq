%N A363240 Number of distinct resistances that can be produced from a circuit that is a 2-connected loopless multigraph with n edges and each edge having a unit resistor.
%C A363240 The resistances between any two nodes of the graph are counted.
%C A363240 All resistances in A337517 can be obtained by serial combinations of resistances of one or more 2-connected loopless multigraphs.
%e A363240 a(2)=1 since the only multigraph with 2 edges is a double edge graph which forms resistance 1/2.
%e A363240 For n=4, there are a quadruple edge graph (resistance 1/4), a triangle graph with one double edge (2/5 between double edge and 3/5 between single edge) and square graph (3/4 between neighbor nodes and 1 between opposite nodes) so a(4)=5.
