%N A363841 Continued fraction expansion of Sum_{k>=0} 1/(k!)!^2.
%C A363841 In general, sums of the form Sum_{k>=0} 1/(k!)!^t, t > 1 in N, have the following continued fraction expansion formulas:
%C A363841 The first term is always 2.
%C A363841 Let P(k) = (((k+1)!)! / ((k!)!)^2)^t - 1.
%C A363841 Take the sequence A157196 and replace the runs of '1,1' with 2^t - 1, the odd occurring runs of '2' with 2^t, and the even occurring runs of '2' with 2^t - 2. Finally interleave the modified sequence with a string of 1's and let it be called f(n). To get the continued fraction expansion, interleave the n-th runs of '2^t', '2^t - 1, 1', '1, 2^t - 1' and '1, 2^t - 2, 1' in f(n), and P(A001511(n)+1).
%C A363841 The next term a(11) has 303 digits. - _Stefano Spezia_, Jun 24 2023

%F A363841 Take the sequence A157196 and replace the runs of '1,1' with '3'. Then replace the odd occurring runs of '2' with '4'. Finally interleave the modified sequence with a string of 1's and let it be called f(n). To get the continued fraction expansion, interleave between the n-th runs of '4', '3, 1', '1, 3' and '1, 2, 1' in f(n), and P(A001511(n)+1).
