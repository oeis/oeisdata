%N A127633 Pure numbers in the Collatz (3x+1) iteration that are not multiples of 3.
%C A127633 The sequence is a list of pure numbers not congruent to 0 mod 3. The remaining pure numbers are congruent to 1 or 7 mod 18.
%C A127633 After computing all a(n) < 10^9, the ratio a(n)/n appears to be converging to 10.101... Hence it appears that the numbers in this sequence have a density of about 99/1000. - _T. D. Noe_, Oct 12 2007

%F A127633 A positive integer n is pure if its entire tree of preimages under the Collatz function C is greater than or equal to it; otherwise n is impure [Shaw, p. 195]. For n a positive integer, the function C is defined by C(n) = {3n+1, n odd; n/2, n even}.
