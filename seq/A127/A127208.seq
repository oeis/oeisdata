%N A127208 Union of all n-step Lucas sequences, that is, all sequences s(1-n) = s(2-n) = ... = s(-1) = -1, s(0) = n and for k > 0, s(k) = s(k-1) + ... + s(k-n).
%C A127208 Noe and Post conjectured that the only positive terms that are common to any two distinct n-step Lucas sequences are the Mersenne numbers (A001348) that begin each sequence and 7 and 11 (in 2- and 3-step) and 5071 (in 3- and 4-step). The intersection of this sequence with the union of all the n-step Fibonacci sequences (A124168) appears to consist of 4, 21, 29, the Mersenne numbers 2^n-1 for all n and the infinite set of Eulerian numbers in A127232.
