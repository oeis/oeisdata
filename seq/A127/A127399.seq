%N A127399 Number of segments of the longest possible zigzag paths fitting into a circle of diameter 2 if the path with index n is constructed according to the rules of the "Snakes on a Plane" problem of _Al Zimmermann_'s programming contest.
%C A127399 The extension of the contest problem to larger sets of hinge angles was proposed by _James R. Buddenhagen_. A link to the contest rules is given in A127400. Results up to n=32 were found by _Markus Sigg_. Known lower bounds for the next terms are a(27)>=29, a(28)>=32, a(29)>=34, a(30>=34, a(31)>=34, a(32)>=39.
