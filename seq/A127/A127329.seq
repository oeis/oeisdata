%F A127329 Conjecture: a(n) = 3*A000040(n+2). - _Zak Seidov_, Jun 28 2015
%F A127329 Every member of the sequence is 3 times a prime; it is believed that every prime >= 5 arises in this way. This is related to Goldbach's conjecture: see comments to A078611. - _Robert Israel_ and _Michel Marcus_, Jun 28 2015
%e A127329 a(1) = 15 because 15 = 3 + 5 + 7;
%e A127329 a(2) = 21 because 21 = 3 + 7 + 11.
