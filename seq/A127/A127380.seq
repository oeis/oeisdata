%N A127380 Signature-permutation of the inverse of Callan's 2006 bijection on Dyck Paths, mirrored version (A057164-conjugate).
%C A127380 This automorphism is RIBS-transformation (explained in A122200) of the automorphism A127378 and Callan's original variant A127382 is obtained as A057164(A127380(A057164(n))).

%o A127380 (Scheme) ;; Implementation of this automorphism, destructive, that acts on S-expressions, i.e. list-structures:
%o A127380 (define (*A127380! s) (for-each *A127378! s) s)
%Y A127380 Inverse: A127379. a(n) = A057164(A127382(A057164(n))). A127302(a(n)) = A127302(n) holds for all n.
%Y A127380 Differs from A073288 for the first time at n=49, where a(n)=64, while A073288(49)=63 and differs from A122350 for the first time at n=54, where a(n)=54, while A122350(54)=57.
