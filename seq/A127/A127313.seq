%N A127313 Primes p such that p+q+r, where p, q, r are consecutive primes, equals s+t+1, where s and t are consecutive primes.
%C A127313 The smallest of three consecutive primes whose sum is equal to 1 plus the sum of two consecutive primes.
%e A127313 37, 41, 43 are consecutive primes, 37+41+43 = 121; 59 and 61 are consecutive primes, 59+61+1 = 121. Hence 37 is a term.
%e A127313 19, 23, 29 are consecutive primes, 19+23+29 = 71; 31 and 37 are consecutive primes, 31+37+1 = 69 < 71; 37 and 41 are the next pair of consecutive primes, 37+41+1 = 79 > 71. Hence there are no consecutive primes s and t with s+t+1 = 71 and 19 is not in the sequence.
