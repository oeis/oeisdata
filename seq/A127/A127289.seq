%N A127289 Signature-permutation of a Catalan automorphism: composition of A127291 and A057164.
%C A127289 This is otherwise like A127291, but uses A127285 instead of A127287 as a "picker permutation" for the function "tau", which can be found in the entry A127291. A014486->parenthesization is given in A014486. This permutation contains some exceptionally large cycles, see A127297.

%Y A127289 Inverse: A127290. a(n) = A127291(A057164(n)) = A057164(A127299(n)). The number of cycles, maximum cycle sizes and LCM's of all cycle sizes in range [A014137(n-1)..A014138(n-1)] of this permutation are given by A127296, A127297 and A127298.
