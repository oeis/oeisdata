%F A127161 Define s(i)=sigma(i)-i=A000203(i)-i. Then if the aliquot sequence obtained by repeatedly iterating s contains a prime as a member of its trajectory, i is included in this sequence
%e A127161 a(10)=12 because the tenth integer whose aliquot sequence terminates by encountering a prime as a member of its trajectory is 12. The complete aliquot sequence generated by iterating the proper divisors of 12 is 12->16->15->9->4->3->1->0
