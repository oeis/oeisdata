%N A127536 Sum of jump-lengths of all even trees with 2n edges.
%C A127536 An even tree is an ordered tree in which each vertex has an even outdegree. In the preorder traversal of an ordered tree, any transition from a node at a deeper level to a node on a strictly higher level is called a jump; the positive difference of the levels is called the jump distance; the sum of the jump distances in a given ordered tree is called the jump-length.
%C A127536 The Krandick reference considers jumps and jump-length only in full binary trees.
