%F A127162 Define s(i)=sigma(i)-i=A000203(i)-i. Then if i is composite and the aliquot sequence obtained by repeatedly applying the mapping i->s(i) contains a prime as a member of its trajectory, i is included in this sequence.
%e A127162 a(5)=12 because the fifth composite number whose aliquot sequence terminates by encountering a prime as a member of its trajectory is 12. The complete aliquot sequence generated by iterating the proper divisors of 12 is 12->16->15->9->4->3->1->0
