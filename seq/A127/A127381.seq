%N A127381 Signature-permutation of Callan's 2006 bijection on Dyck Paths.
%C A127381 This automorphism is much easier to implement for S-expressions when viewed as a A057164-conjugate of A127379. See the comments in the latter entry.

%Y A127381 Inverse: A127382. a(n) = A057164(A127379(A057164(n))). The number of cycles and the number of fixed points in range [A014137(n-1)..A014138(n-1)] of this permutation are given by A127384 and A086625 shifted once right. The maximum cycles and LCM's of cycle sizes begin as 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 16, 16, 16, 16, ...
