%N A127745 a(n) = A074664(n) - A000108(n-1).
%C A127745 A074664 counts the Bell Numbers associated with the partition number [n]. A000108 counts the corresponding Catalan numbers and here we count the remaining Bell numbers associated with the partition number [n].
%e A127745 There are 15 Bell objects when n = 4, 14 are also Catalans so a(4) = 1.
%e A127745 There are 52 Bell objects when n = 5, 42 are also Catalans; we know that 5 = 4+1 = 1+4 which accounts for two of the non-Catalan Bells so, a(5) = 52 - 42 - 2 = 8.
