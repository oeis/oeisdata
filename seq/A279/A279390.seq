%C A279390 From _Omar E. Pol_, Oct 21 2017: (Start)
%C A279390 According to the law of universal gravitation, the attractive force (F) between two bodies is proportional to the product of their masses (m_1 and m_2), and inversely proportional to the square of the distance, r, between them. Newton's formula is F = G*m_1*m_2/r^2, where G is the constant of gravitation. Using both the Planck force (F_P) and Einstein's formula E = m*c^2, the law of universal gravitation could be written as F = (G/c^4)*m_1*c^2*m_2*c^2/r^2, or, more simply, F = (1/F_P)*E_1*E_2/r^2, where both E_1 and E_2 are the energies of the bodies.
%C A279390 Then using the Einstein's formula E = m*c^2 and the Planck-Einstein relation E = h*f, the law of universal gravitation between two photons could be written as F = (G*h^2/c^4)*f_1*f_2/r^2, or simply, F = (h^2/F_P)*f_1*f_2/r^2, or, more simply, F = Q*f_1*f_2/r^2, where both f_1 and f_2 are the frequencies of the photons and Q is this constant.
