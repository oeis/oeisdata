%N A279684 The maximum number of coins that can be processed in n weighings that all are real except for one LHR-coin starting in the heavy or real state.
%C A279684 An LHR-coin is a coin that can change its weight periodically from light to heavy to real to light.
%C A279684 Also the number of outcomes of n weighings that start with a balance and every even-numbered imbalance that is not the last one must be followed by a balance, or every odd-numbered imbalance that is not the last one must be followed by a balance.

%e A279684 If we have two weighings we are not allowed to have outcomes that consist of two imbalances. That means a(2) = 9 - 4 = 5.
%e A279684 If we have three weighings we are not allowed the following outcomes: <<=, <<<, where any less-than sign can be interchanged with a greater-than sign. Thus a(3) = 27 - 4 - 8 = 15.
