%N A279930 Numbers which are highly composite and highly Brazilian.
%C A279930 For a(6) = 360 to a(85) = 321253732800, the last term known today, there are 80 successive highly composite numbers that are also highly Brazilian numbers.
%C A279930 If beta(n) is the number of Brazilian representations of n, as in A284758, we have the following relations:
%C A279930 1) for a(k) = m with k <= 85 except 1, 9, 20 and 47, tau(m) = 2*beta(m) + 2, but,
%C A279930 2) for a(1) = 1, tau(1) = 2*beta(1) + 1, because beta(1) = 0, and,
%C A279930 3) for a(9) = 1260, a(20) = 50400 and a(47) = 4324320, tau(m) = 2*beta(m) + 4 because 1260 = 35*36, 50400 = 224*225 and 4324320 = 2079*2080 are oblong numbers.

%e A279930 360 is the 13th highly composite number and the 10th highly Brazilian number.
%e A279930 336 is the 9th highly Brazilian number, but is not a highly composite number since tau(336) = tau(240) = 20 and 240 is the 12th highly composite number.
%e A279930 240 is the 12th highly composite number, but is not a highly Brazilian number because beta(240) = beta(180) = 8 and 180 is the 8th highly Brazilian number.
