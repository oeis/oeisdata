%N A279082 Smallest tetrahedral number with exactly n divisors, or 0 if no such number exists.
%C A279082 If the k-th tetrahedral number (i.e., A000292(k) = k*(k+1)*(k+2)/6) has exactly 42 divisors, it must be of the form p^6 * q^2 * r where p, q, and r are distinct primes, and it can be shown that p^6, q^2, and r must be k, (k+1)/2, and (k+2)/3, in some order. This results in six cases:

%C A279082 .
%C A279082 Cases 1 and 2 require p^6 + 1 = 2*q^2 and p^6 + 1 = 2*r, respectively, but both can be ruled out by factoring p^6 + 1 = (p^2 + 1)*(p^4 - p^2 + 1).
%C A279082 The four remaining cases require, respectively, the existence of a square of the form 2*p^6 - 1, (2*p^6 + 1)/3, 3*p^6 - 2, or (3*p^6 - 1)/2. An exhaustive search of the primes p up to 10^10 finds none that yields a square for any of those four forms, so if a(42) is not zero, then a(42) > (10^10)^18 / 6 = 1.666...*10^179.

(a(92), too large to show here, is p^22*((3*p^22 - 1)/2)*(3*p^22 - 2) where p = 10711.) [Updated by _Max Alekseyev_, Feb 03 2024]
%C A279082 Solutions to 2*p^6 = q^2 + 1 correspond to (some) integral points (X,Y) = (p^2, q) on the elliptic curve 2*X^3 = Y^2 + 1. All other cases for n = 42, as well as all the cases for n in {50, 70, 78, 98}, also correspond to elliptic curves, and I have computationally verified that all their integral points do not have the required form. Hence, a(42) = a(50) = a(70) = a(78) = a(98) = 0. - _Max Alekseyev_, Feb 03 2024
