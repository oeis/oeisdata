%N A279609 a(n) = floor(H(k) + exp(H(k))*log(H(k))) - sigma(k) where H(k) is the k-th harmonic number Sum_{j=1..k} 1/j and k is the n-th colossally abundant number A004490(n).
%C A279609 By a theorem of J. C. Lagarias, the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the proposition that this sequence never takes a negative value. In fact, by inspection it appears to be monotone increasing; this conjecture implies the Riemann hypothesis but is not in any obvious way implied by it. Stronger conjectures are easy to formulate--for example, if F(n) is the function defined by this sequence, then F(n)/2^n also appears to be monotone increasing.
