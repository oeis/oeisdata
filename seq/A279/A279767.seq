%N A279767 Numbers n such that n and n + 2 have the same prime signature.
%C A279767 The sequence contains some terms such that n and n + 2k (1 < k) have the same prime signature.  For some terms where n and n + 2k share the same prime signature this means that every alternate element between, and including n and n + 2k have the same prime signature. The first such example is where a(41951)=402677, a(41953)=402679, and a(41955)=402681, share the same prime signature {1, 1}. Also the remaining alternate terms excluding endpoints share the same prime signature. Using the above example a(41952)=402678 and a(41954)=402680, share the prime signature {1,1,3}. - _Torlach Rush_, Feb 25 2018

%e A279767 18 is a term because 18 = 2 * 3^2 and 18 + 2 = 20 = 2^2 * 5.
%e A279767 19 is not a term because it is prime and 21 is the product of two primes, so the prime signatures are different.
