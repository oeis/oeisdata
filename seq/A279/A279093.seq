%N A279093 Numbers that are nontrivially palindromic in three or more consecutive integer bases.
%C A279093 For any integer b > 1, the base-b expansion of any number k < b will be a one-digit number, and will thus be trivially palindromic.
%C A279093 For each j >= 5 and odd, k = (j^3 + 6*j^2 + 14*j + 11)/2 is a term in the sequence, and represents a 3-digit palindrome in each of three consecutive integer bases:

%C A279093 From _Matej Veselovac_, Mar 31 2018: (Start)
%C A279093 Similarly to the one 3-digit and one 5-digit families given above, at least seven more infinite families exist, for 7-digit consecutive palindromes. Given a nonnegative integer n, we have the following representations palindromic in exactly three consecutive integer number bases j+1, j+2, j+3 :
%C A279093 1. For each j = 36+12n, k = (816 + 2474*j + 3114*j^2 + 2117*j^3 + 852*j^4 + 209*j^5 + 30*j^6 + 2*j^7)/12 is a term of the sequence.
%C A279093 2. For each j = 55+6n, k = (245 + 748 j + 980 j^2 + 718 j^3 + 320 j^4 + 88 j^5 + 14 j^6 + j^7)/6 is a term of the sequence.
%C A279093 3. For each j = 73+2n, k = (247 + 748 j + 980 j^2 + 718 j^3 + 320 j^4 + 88 j^5 + 14 j^6 + j^7)/2 is a term of the sequence.
%C A279093 4. For each j = 116+12n, k = (2440 + 7366 j + 9694 j^2 + 7171 j^3 + 3232 j^4 + 895 j^5 + 142 j^6 + 10 j^7)/12 is a term of the sequence.
%C A279093 5. For each j = 172+6n, k = (812 + 2446 j + 3290 j^2 + 2527 j^3 + 1190 j^4 + 343 j^5 + 56 j^6 + 4 j^7)/6 is a term of the sequence.
%C A279093 6. For each j = 288+12n, k = (1176 + 3566 j + 4374 j^2 + 2807 j^3 + 1032 j^4 + 227 j^5 + 30 j^6 + 2 j^7)/12 is a term of the sequence.
%C A279093 7. For each j = 277+6n, k = (1237 + 3740 j + 4900 j^2 + 3590 j^3 + 1600 j^4 + 440 j^5 + 70 j^6 + 5 j^7)/6 is a term of the sequence.
%C A279093 The smallest terms given by these families are of magnitudes ~ 10^10.3, 10^11.5, 10^12.8, 10^14.4, 10^15.5, 10^16.4 and 10^17. The smallest term of the next family, if it exists, is at least of magnitude ~ 10^18.
%C A279093 Almost all known terms of the sequence so far belong in one of the above defined families, either being 3-, 5-, or 7- digit palindromes in exactly 3 consecutive integer number bases.
%C A279093 There are 13 known terms that do not belong to any families: 300, 3360633, 19987816, 43443858, 532083314, 1778140759, 2721194733, 11325719295, 47622367425, 97638433343, 224678540182, 265282702996, 561091062285 (all but 300 so far are 7-digit cases).
%C A279093 Infinite families for consecutive palindromes longer than 7 digits, as well as any examples for those cases, have not yet been observed.
%C A279093 Smallest example for 9-digit consecutive palindromes does not exist within first 100 integer number bases, thus is at least > 10^16.
%C A279093 Similarly, no terms palindromic in 4 or more consecutive integer number bases have been found, so far.

%e A279093 178 is in the sequence because the bases in which 178 is nontrivially palindromic include 6, 7, and 8: 178 = 454_6 = 343_7 = 262_8.
%e A279093 373 is in the sequence because the bases in which 373 is nontrivially palindromic include 8, 9, and 10: 373 = 565_8 = 454_9 = 373_10.
%e A279093 265282702996 is in the sequence because the bases in which it is nontrivially palindromic include 43, 44, and 45.
%e A279093 130 is nontrivially palindromic in 7 integer bases (11211_3 = 2002_4 = 202_8 = aa_12 = 55_25 = 22_64 = 11_129), but these bases do not include three consecutive integers, so 130 is not in the sequence.
