%N A154753 Reduced period of the Fibonacci 3-step sequence A000073 mod prime(n).
%C A154753 The Fibonacci 3-step (tribonacci) sequence t(k) begins (with offset -2) 1,0,0. For a prime p, the reduced period r is the least number such that p divides both t(r-1) and t(r); i.e., "0,0" appears in the sequence mod p. The ratio of the period A106302 and the reduced period is either 1 or 3; see A154754.

%F A154753 a(n) = A046738(prime(n)).
%e A154753 The tribonacci sequence (starting with 1) mod 7 begins with the 48 terms 1,1,2,4,0,6,3,2,4,2,1,0,3,4,0,0,4,4,1,2,0,3,5,1,2,1,4,0,5,2,0,0,2,2,4,1, 0,5,6,4,1,4,2,0,6,1,0,0. The first "0,0" terms occur at index 16. Hence a(4)=16.
