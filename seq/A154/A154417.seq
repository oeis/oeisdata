%N A154417 Number of ways to express n as the sum of an odd prime, a positive Fibonacci number and half of a positive Fibonacci number.
%C A154417 On Jan 09 2009, _Zhi-Wei Sun_ conjectured that a(n)>0 for every n=5,6,...; in other words, any integer n>4 can be written in the form p+F_s+F_{3t}/2 with p an odd prime and s,t>0. Sun verified this up to 5*10^6 and Qing-Hu Hou continued the verification (on Sun's request) up to 3*10^8. Note that 932633 cannot be written as p+F_s+F_{3t}/2 with p a prime and (F_s or F_{3t}/2) odd. If we set u_0=0, u_1=1 and u_{n+1}=4u_n+u_{n-1} for n=1,2,3,..., then F_{3t}/2=u_t is at least 4^{t-1} for each t=1,2,3,.... In a recent paper K. J. Wu and Z. W. Sun constructed a residue class which contains no integers of the form p+F_{3t}/2 with p a prime and t nonnegative.
