%N A154638 a(n) is the number of distinct reduced words of length n in the Coxeter group of "Apollonian reflections" in three dimensions.
%C A154638 Definition means that all possible length-reducing cancellations have been applied and words that are equal are counted only once.
%C A154638 This group has five generators, satisfying (S_i)^2 = (S_i S_j)^3 = I.
%C A154638 ABA and BAB are equal, so are counted as only one distinct word.

%F A154638 There's a handy program (or rather, a constellation of programs), kbmag by Derek Holt et al., which can be used as a package within GAP or as a free-standing program, to try to find an automatic structure for a group. I entered this presentation, and it produced an automatic structure, which implies the growth function is rational: (1 + 2*X + 2*X^2 + X^3)/(1 - 3*X - 3*X^2 + 6*X^3), as reported by kbgrowth. _John Cannon_ also found this g.f. - _William P.

%F A154638 Recurrence: for n >= 1, a(n+3) = 3*a(n+2) + 3*a(n+1) - 6*a(n) with a(0..3)={1,5,20,70}. - _Zak Seidov_, Dec 07 2009
%e A154638 There are 80 squarefree words of length 3, but 20 of these fall into 10 equal pairs (e.g., ABA = BAB). So a(3)=70.
