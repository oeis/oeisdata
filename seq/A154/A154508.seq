%N A154508 Numbers k such that appending k to the k-th nonprime yields a prime.
%C A154508 Previous title: "Numbers n if concatenation of n-th nonprime and n = prime."
%C A154508 Indices n such that the concatenation A141468(n)//n yields a prime. - _R. J. Mathar_, Jan 12 2009
%e A154508 Since 4=nonprime(3) and 43 is prime, 3 is in this sequence.
%e A154508 Since 10=nonprime(7) and 107 is prime, 7 is in this sequence.
%e A154508 Since 14=nonprime(9) and 149 is prime, 9 is in this sequence.
%e A154508 Since 27=nonprime(23) and 3323 is prime, 23 is in this sequence.
%e A154508 Since 56=nonprime(41) and 5641 is prime, 41 is in this sequence, etc.
%e A154508 The sequence A141468 concatenated with the positive nonzero integers begins 1, 12, 43, 64, 85, 96, 107, 128, 149, 1510, 1611, ... Among these terms, 43, 107, and 149 are primes, so 3, 7, and 9 are in this sequence. - _Charlie Neder_, Dec 23 2018
