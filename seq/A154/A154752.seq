%N A154752 Least prime p (or 0) such that n = p + T, where T is a triangular number (A000217), or -1 if there is no such representation.
%C A154752 Zhi-Wei Sun conjectures that only n=216 has no such representation. It appears that n = 2, 7, 61 and 211 are the only numbers for which the triangular number 0 is required in the representation (see A065397). When n is a triangular number, then a(n)=0. Sequence A132399 gives the number of representations of n as p+T. As n becomes larger, the largest prime required to verify the conjecture increases slowly. For example, for n<=10^3, the largest prime required is 953; for n<=10^6 it is 373361; for n<=10^9 it is only 36455351. Using primes less than 10^9, all n<243277591560 have been verified.
