%C A154272 Dirichlet inverse of this sequence is A154271. There is progression of sequences starting with A000007, A019590 and then this sequence A154272. From A019590 onwards the Dirichlet inverse of such sequences appears to be positive as often as negative. Except for the first term, the all 1's sequence A000012, is a union of the 1's in sequences A000007, A019590, A154272 etc. It therefore in a sense seems likely that the Moebius function is positive as often as negative because the Dirichlet inverse of A000012 is the Moebius function A008683. However the whole is more than the sum of its parts and the likelihood of the signs of the Moebius function cannot be inferred.
%C A154272 With offset -1, this is the replicable function number 1a. The generating function A(x) = 1/x + x is the first modular "fiction". This is a completely 2-replicable function. The g.f. A(x) satisfies 0 = f(A(x), A(x^2)) where f(u, v) = v + 2 - u^2. Similarly the replicable function number 2b gives the sequence 1,0,-1,0,0,0,0,0,... - _Michael Somos_, Aug 04 2009
%C A154272 The g.f. x+x^3 equals x*Phi(4,x), where Phi are the cyclotomic polynomials. The series reversion of y=x+x^3 is x = y - y^3 + 3*y^5 - 12*y^7 + 55*y^9 - ..., which is a signed variant of A001764. - _R. J. Mathar_, Sep 29 2012
