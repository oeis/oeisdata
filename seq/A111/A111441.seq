%N A111441 Numbers k such that the sum of the squares of the first k primes is divisible by k.
%C A111441 a(16) > 10^14 if it exists. - _Anders Kaseorg_, Dec 02 2020
%C A111441 Conjecture: There are no terms that are 3 or 9 modulo 12. This seems to hold for all related sequences with even powers of primes, not just squares. Compare "sums of powers of primes divisibility sequences", linked below. - _Daniel Bamberger_, Dec 03 2020
%C A111441 From _Jacob Christian Munch-Andersen_, Dec 13 2020: (Start)
%C A111441 Any prime except 3 raised to the 2nd power is 1 modulo 3. Therefore adding the squared primes together results in a simple periodic pattern modulo 3. Any term that is 0 modulo 3 would imply that it divides a number that is 2 modulo 3; as this is impossible there cannot be any terms divisible by 3.
%C A111441 The same proof indeed holds for similar lists generated with any even power, and a similar proof for instance disqualifies any multiple of 5 from the similar 4th-power list. A slightly simpler similar proof shows that there are no terms divisible by 2.
%C A111441 (End)
%C A111441 The previous comment implies that for a list generated with the m-th power, there are no terms divisible by p when p is prime and p-1 is a divisor of m. For example, the 12th power list has no terms divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7 or 13. - _Paul W. Dyson_, Jan 09 2021
%C A111441 The periodic pattern of the sum of primes raised to an even power as described in the comments above follows from Fermat's little theorem. When the pattern is periodic for a given p it can be seen that when k mod p = 0 the sum mod p = p-1 and therefore sum mod k cannot be 0. - _Bruce Garner_, Apr 08 2021
%C A111441 a(2) is also a value in each of the lists generated with the powers 20, 38, 56... . a(3) is also a value in each of the lists generated with the powers 38, 74, 110... . In general, if the sum of the first k primes each to the power of m is divisible by k, and m >= the maximum exponent in the prime factorization of k, then the sum of the first k primes each to the power of m + j * psi(k) is also divisible by k, where psi(k) is the reduced totient function (A002322) and j is any positive integer. This follows from the fact that n^m == n^(m + psi(k)) (mod k) for all integers n and all integers m >= the maximum exponent in the prime factorization of k. - _Paul W. Dyson_, Dec 09 2022
