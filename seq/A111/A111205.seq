%N A111205 Nonsquare composite numbers k such that the difference between the closest squares surrounding k and k have a common divisor greater than 1.
%C A111205 Conjecture: The number of terms in this sequence is infinite.
%F A111205 Let k be a nonsquare composite number and r = floor(sqrt(k)). Then the closest surrounding squares of k are r^2 and (r+1)^2. So d = (r+1)^2 - r^2 = 2*r+1. If gcd(k, d) > 1 then k is a term.
%e A111205 14 is a nonsquare composite number. 3^2 and 4^2 are the closest squares surrounding 14. So the difference, 16-9 = 7 and 14 have a common divisor greater than 1 namely 7, so 14 is a term.
