%N A111252 Primes p such that the difference between the closest squares surrounding p is prime.
%C A111252 Conjecture: The number of terms in this sequence is infinite.
%C A111252 That there are infinitely many terms in this sequence would follow from the Legendre conjecture (one of the Landau problems - see the Weisstein link) that there is always a prime between n^2 and (n+1)^2. This is still an open problem. - _Max Alekseyev_, Apr 20 2006

%F A111252 Let p be a prime number and r = floor(sqrt(p)). Then the closest surrounding squares of p are r^2 and (r+1)^2. So d = (r+1)^2 - r^2 = 2r+1. If d is prime then list p.
%e A111252 29 is a prime number. 5^2 and 6^2 are the closest squares surrounding 29. Now the difference 36-25 = 11 is prime so 29 is in the table.
