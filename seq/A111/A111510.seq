%N A111510 If n is even then a(n) is the nearest integer to Pi^n/Zeta(n), otherwise a(n) is the nearest integer to (Pi^n - n*e)/Zeta(n).
%C A111510 Lim_{n->inf.} i_n/i_(n-1) approaches Pi. e.g. 2791558571/8885799011=~3.141598593...
%C A111510 See A108925. Analytical Pi (for n>=4 but here n>10^6 say),(n=1 2 3...n). Take n straight lines monotonically increasing in length by one and join them end to end; the last to the first. When the enclosed area is at its maximum every vertex will lie on the circumference of a circle the diameter of which divided into Triangular(n) equals Pi.
%C A111510 There is an interesting benchmark when n=8. The radius calculated using Pi equals 5.7296...; one tenth of the number of degrees in a radian. The radius when plotted as a drawing is very near to six and, tentatively, this could be ten times a constant near to point six.
%C A111510 It appears that a(2n-1) taken when rounded down (rather than to the nearest integer) is equal to A100594(n). - _Terry D. Grant_, May 28 2017

%e A111510 a(n) = d where d is the integer divisor of Pi^n for even n and (Pi^n)-ne for odd n having a solution closest to Zeta(n).
%e A111510 a(2) = 6 then (Pi^2)/6 = Zeta(2); a(3)=19, (Pi^3-3e)/19 approx = Zeta(3); a(4)=90, (Pi^4)/90 = Zeta(4); and the only special case the author has found where ((Pi^4)-4e)/80 approx = Zeta(4).
