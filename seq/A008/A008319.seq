%N A008319 Smallest number that is sum of squares of distinct earlier terms.
%C A008319 Up to a(99999680)=10^8, the largest number not in the sequence is 892. I also computed, up to a(99934078)=10^8, the similar sequence which starts with 1,2 instead of 1,1. The largest number not in that sequence seems to be 134179 - _Giovanni Resta_, Oct 06 2011
%C A008319 Resta's conjecture is correct. Let x = floor(sqrt(n) - 12). For n > 1935, x^2 > n/2. For n > 1853, n - x^2 > 892. So n > 1935 can be decomposed into x^2 plus a number greater than 892. Since the other number is smaller than x^2, any decomposition into squares will use only numbers smaller than x. By induction, all numbers greater than 1935 (and hence greater than 892) are in this sequence. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Oct 06 2011
