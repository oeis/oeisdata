%N A008062 a(n) = maximal value of m such that an n X m radar array exists. (A (0,1) matrix A such that any horizontal shift of A overlaps A in at most a single 1.)
%C A008062 Also, maximal length of a 2-surprising sequence in n symbols. (A sequence of symbols is 2-surprising if, for every pair of symbols X and Y, not necessarily distinct and every distance D, there is at most one position in t he sequence where X precedes Y by distance D.) - _John W. Layman_, Nov 17 2003
%C A008062 _Dan Hoey_ (Jan 13 2006) points out that the equivalence of the two definitions is a consequence of the equivalence (for any sequence s_1,s_2,...) of "Exists i,j,k,l : s_i = s_j, s_k = s_l and i-k = j-l" and "Exists i,j,k,l : s_i = s_j, s_k = s_l and i-j = k-l".
