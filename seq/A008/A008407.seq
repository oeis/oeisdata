%N A008407 Minimal difference s(n) between beginning and end of n consecutive large primes (n-tuplet) permitted by divisibility considerations.
%C A008407 Tony Forbes defines a prime k-tuplet (distinguished from a prime k-tuple) to be a maximally possible dense cluster of primes (a prime constellation) which will necessarily involve consecutive primes whereas a prime k-tuple is a prime cluster which may not necessarily be of maximum possible density (in which case the primes are not necessarily consecutive.)
%C A008407 a(n) >> n log log n; in particular, for any eps > 0, there is an N such that a(n) > (e^gamma - eps) n log log n for all n > N. Probably N can be chosen as 1; the actual rate of growth is larger. Can a larger growth rate be established? Perhaps a(n) ~ n log n. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Apr 19 2012
%C A008407 Conjecture: (i) The sequence a(n)^(1/n) (n=3,4,...) is strictly decreasing (to the limit 1). (ii) We have 0 < a(n)/n - H_n < (gamma + 2)/(log n) for all n > 4, where H_n denotes the harmonic number 1+1/2+1/3+...+1/n, and gamma refers to the Euler constant 0.5772... [The second inequality has been verified for n = 5, 6, ..., 5000.] - _Zhi-Wei Sun_, Jun 28 2013.
%C A008407 Conjecture: For any integer n > 2, there is 1 < k < n such that 2*n - a(k)- 1 and 2*n - a(k) + 1 are twin primes. Also, every n = 3, 4, ... can be written as p + a(k)/2 with p a prime and k an integer greater than one. - _Zhi-Wei Sun_, Jun 29-30 2013.
%C A008407 The number of configurations that realize this minimal diameter, is A083409(n). - _Jeppe Stig Nielsen_, Jul 26 2018
%C A008407 Engelsma points out that the values he lists past a(342)=2328 are only the "best known" values, and are not confirmed as minimal. - _Brian Kehrig_, Mar 21 2025
