%N A180279 Triangle read by rows: AR(n,k) is the number of aperiodic k-reverses of n (n >= 1, 1 <= k <= n).
%C A180279 A k-composition of n is an ordered collection of k positive integers (parts) which sum to n.
%C A180279 A k-composition is aperiodic (primitive) if its period is k, or if it is not the concatenation of at least two smaller [identical] compositions.
%C A180279 Two k-compositions are cyclically equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by a cyclic permutation of its parts.
%C A180279 The reverse of a k-composition is the k-composition obtained by writing its parts in reverse. For example the reverse of 123 is 321.
%C A180279 A k-reverse of n is a k-composition of n which is cyclically equivalent to its reverse. And an aperiodic k-reverse of n is a k-reverse of n which is aperiodic.
%C A180279 For example, 114 is an aperiodic 3-reverse of 6 since it is aperiodic and its set of cyclic equivalents {114, 411, 141} contains its reverse 411.
%C A180279 But 123 is not an aperiodic 3-reverse of 6 since, even though it is aperiodic, its set of cyclic equivalents {123, 312, 231} does not contain its reverse 321.
%C A180279 Let AR(n,k) denote the number of aperiodic k-reverses of n.
%C A180279 This sequence is the 'AR(n,k)' triangle read by rows.

%F A180279 AR(n, k) = k * Sum_{d|gcd(n,k)} mu(d) * A119963(n/d, k/d). - _Andrew Howroyd_, Oct 08 2017 (Corrected by _Petros Hadjicostas_, Oct 11 2017.)
%e A180279 Triangle AR(n,k) (with n >= 1 and 1 <= k <= n) begins as follows:
%e A180279   1
%e A180279   1 0
%e A180279   1 2  0
%e A180279   1 2  3  0
%e A180279   1 4  6  4  0
%e A180279   1 4  3  8  5  0
%e A180279   1 6  9 12 15  6  0
%e A180279   1 6  9 16 15 18  7  0
%e A180279   1 8  9 24 30 18 28  8 0
%e A180279   1 8 12 32 25 48 28 32 9 0
%e A180279   ...
%e A180279 For example, row 8 is 1 6 9 16 15 18 7 0.
%e A180279 We have AR(8,3) = 9 because there are 9 aperiodic 3-reverses of 8.
%e A180279 These are in the classes {116, 611, 161}, {224, 422, 242}, and {233, 323, 332}.
%e A180279 We have AR(8,6) = 18 because all, except 3, of the 21 6-compositions of 8 are aperiodic 6-reverses of 8. The missing 3 form one class, {112112, 211211, 121121}, and they are each 6-reverses of 8, but they are each periodic of period 3; so, they are not aperiodic.
