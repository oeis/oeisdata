%N A180368 Number of steps of the one-sided hydra process for a linear tree of length n.
%C A180368 This process on trees is called Hydra in reference to Hercules myth (2nd work).
%C A180368 When you cut a head (leaf node), a node that was its parent replicates together with a remaining subtree (unless the parent was the root node). It ends when there is only the root node.
%C A180368 Given a linear hydra of length n, how many heads do you have to cut if you always cut the leftmost remaining head?
%C A180368 (Note that in the myth, Hydra had 9 heads and chopped heads were replaced by two smaller ones.)
%e A180368 Here is the sequence of hydra transformations for a(3) = 8.
%e A180368 Sequence of heights is     3,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,0.
%e A180368 Sequence of node counts is 4,4,5,5,4,3,3,2,1.
%e A180368 Sequence of head counts is 1,2,2,3,2,1,2,1,0.
