%N A180634 Numbers n such that the discriminant of the n-th cyclotomic polynomial is a square.
%C A180634 A number n is in this sequence if the Galois group of the n-th cyclotomic polynomial over the rationals contains only even permutations.
%C A180634 Essentially the same as A033949. - _R. J. Mathar_, Oct 15 2011
%C A180634 Also, numbers n such that the product of the elements in the group Z_n of invertible elements mod n (i.e., the product mod n of x such that 1 <= x < n and x is coprime to n) is 1. An equivalent characterization of the latter (apart from n=2): n such that the number of square roots of 1 mod n is divisible by 4. (See comments at A033949). - _Robert Israel_, Dec 08 2014
%C A180634 To see this, use Gauss's generalization of Wilson's theorem namely, the product of the units of Z_n is -1 if n is 4 or p^i or 2p^i for odd primes p, i >0,  and is equal to 1 otherwise. - _W. Edwin Clark_, Dec 09 2014

%e A180634 n=5: The 5th cyclotomic polynomial is x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1 with discriminant 125, which is not a square. The Galois group is generated by (1243), that is an odd permutation. Hence 5 is not in the sequence. n=8: The 8th cyclotomic polynomial is x^4+1 with discriminant 256, which is a square. The Galois group is {id,(13)(57),(15)(37),(17)(35)}, that are all even permutations. Hence 8 is in the sequence.
