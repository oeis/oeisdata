%N A180150 Numbers n such that n and n+2 are both divisible by exactly 4 primes (counted with multiplicity).
%C A180150 "Quadruprimes" or "4-almost primes" that keep that property when incremented by 2. This sequence is to 4 as 3 is to A180117, as A092207 is to 2, and as A001359 is to 1. That is, this sequence is the 4th row of the infinite array A[k,n] = n-th natural number m such that m and m+2 are both divisible by exactly k primes (counted with multiplicity). The first row is the lesser of twin primes. The second row is the sequence such that m and m+2 are both semiprimes.

%F A180150 {m in A014613 and m+2 in A014613} = {m such that bigomega(m) = bigomega(m+2) = 4} = {m such that A001222(m) = A001222(m+2) = 4}.
%e A180150 a(1) = 54 because 54 = 2 * 3^3 is divisible by exactly 4 primes (counted with multiplicity), and so is 54+2 = 56 = 2^3 * 7.
