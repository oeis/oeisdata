%N A180141 Eight rooks and one berserker on a 3 X 3 chessboard. G.f.: (1 + x - 2*x^2)/(1 - 3*x - 6*x^2).
%C A180141 The a(n) represent the number of n-move routes of a fairy chess piece starting in a given corner square (m = 1, 3, 7 or 9) on a 3 X 3 chessboard. This fairy chess piece behaves like a rook on the eight side and corner squares but on the central square the rook goes berserk and turns into a berserker, see A180140.
%C A180141 On a 3 X 3 chessboard there are 2^9 = 512 ways to go berserk on the central square (we assume here that a berserker might behave like a rook). The berserker is represented by the A[5] vector in the fifth row of the adjacency matrix A, see the Maple program. For the corner squares the 512 berserkers lead to 42 berserker sequences, see the cross-references for some examples.
%C A180141 The sequence above corresponds to just one A[5] vectors with decimal value 495. This vector leads for the side squares to 4*A154964 (for n >= 1 with a(0) = 1) and for the central square to 2*A180141 (for n >= 1 with a(0)=1).
%C A180141 This sequence belongs to a family of sequences with g.f. (1 + x + k*x^2)/(1 - 3*x + (k-4)*x^2), see A123620.
