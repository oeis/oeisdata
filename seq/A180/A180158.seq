%N A180158 Number of ways are there to score a break of n points at snooker. Assuming an infinite number of reds are available, along with the usual six colors, and a break alternates red-color-red-...

%e A180158 For n=0 there is one way to score zero points - pot nothing, potting a single red is the one way to have a break of one, a break of two is impossible (as defined here), a break of three can only be achieved with a red followed by a yellow,...
