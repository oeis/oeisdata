%C A180139 Theorem (*Artur Jasinski*):
%C A180139 For any positive number x >= A180139(n) distance between cube of x and square of any y (such that x<>n^2 and y<>n^3) can't be less than A179386(n+1).
%C A180139 Proof: Because number of integral points of each Mordell elliptic curve of the form x^3-y^2 = k is finite and completely computable, such x can't exist.
%C A180139 If x=n^2 and y=n^3 distance d=0.
%C A180139 For d values see A179386.
%C A180139 For y values see A179388.
