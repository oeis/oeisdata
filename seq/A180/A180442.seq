%N A180442 Numbers k such that a sum of two or more consecutive squares beginning with k^2 is a square.
%C A180442 That is, numbers n such that Sum_{i=n..k} i^2 is a square for some k > n.
%C A180442 The paper by Bremner, Stroeker, and Tzanakis describes how they found all n <= 100 by solving elliptic curves. Their solutions are the same as the terms in this sequence. They also show that there are only a finite number of sums of squares beginning with n^2 that sum to a square. For example, starting with 3^2, there are only 3 ways to sum consecutive squares to produce a square: 3^2 + 4^2, 3^2 + ... + 580^2, and 3^2 + ... + 963^2. See A184762, A184763, A184885, and A184886 for more results from their paper.
%C A180442 This sequence is more difficult than A001032, which has the possible lengths of the sequences of consecutive squares that sum to a square. Be careful adding terms to this sequence; a simple search may miss some terms. An elliptic curve needs to be solved for each number.
%C A180442 It is conjectured that the sequence continues 103, 104, 106, 112, 115, 117, 119, 121, 124, 128, 129, 131, 132, 137, 140, 142, 146, 158, 168, 170, 172, 175, 178, 181, 183, 192, 193, 197, 199, 200. - _Jean-François Alcover_, Sep 17 2013.
