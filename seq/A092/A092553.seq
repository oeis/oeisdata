%N A092553 Decimal expansion of 1/e^2.
%C A092553 Consider a substrate (such as polyvinyl alcohol or in forming the polymer of methyl vinyl ketone) in a "1,3 configuration" in which substituents branching off the substrate can irreversibly join with neighboring substituents unless the neighbor is already joined to its other neighbor. Then this constant is the fraction of joined substituents on an infinite substrate.
%C A092553 This also applies to reversible reactions when the rate of forward reaction is much faster than that of backward reaction; see Flory p. 1518 footnote 5. This had "satisfactory accord" with his experimental data using methyl vinyl ketone polymer for which the experimentally-obtained percentage was 0.15.
%C A092553 (A 1,k configuration is a substituent branching off a carbon atom, k-2 intermediate carbon atoms, and substituent branching off a carbon atom.)  - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Nov 30 2012
%C A092553 Also the probability, as n increases without bound, that a permutation of length n is simple: no intervals of length 1 < k < n (an interval of a permutation s is a set of contiguous numbers which in s have consecutive indices). - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, May 14 2014

%F A092553 1/e^2 = Sum_{k >= 0} (-2)^k/k!.
%F A092553 This is the case n = 0 of the following series acceleration formulas:
%F A092553 1/e^2 = n!*2^n*Sum_{k >= 0} (-2)^k/(k!*R(n,k)*R(n,k+1)), n = 0,1,2,..., where R(n,x) = Sum_{k = 0..n} (-1)^k*binomial(n,k)*k!*2^(n-k)*binomial(-x,k) are the (unsigned) row polynomials of A137346. Cf. A094816. (End)
