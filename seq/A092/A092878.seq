%N A092878 Number of initial odd numbers in class n of the iterated phi function.
%C A092878 Class n, for n>0, contains all numbers k such that n iterations of the Euler phi function applied to k yields 2; class 0 contains only the numbers 1 and 2. There is a conjecture that the smallest number in class n is always odd. This increasing sequence supports that conjecture. As shown by Shapiro, all the initial odd numbers in class n>0 are between 2^n and 2^(n+1).

%e A092878 a(2) = 2 because the sequence of eight numbers 5,7,8,9,10,12,14,18 (which all take exactly 2 iterations of the phi function to produce 2) begins with 2 odd numbers.
