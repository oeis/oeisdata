%C A092186 Singmaster's problem: "A salesman's office is located on a straight road. His n customers are all located along this road to the east of the office, with the office of customer k at distance k from the salesman's office. The salesman must make a driving trip whereby he leaves the office, visits each customer exactly once, then returns to the office.
%C A092186 "Because he makes a profit on his mileage allowance, the salesman wants to drive as far as possible during his trip. What is the maximum possible distance he can travel on such a trip and how many different such trips are there?
%C A092186 "Assume that if the travel plans call for the salesman to visit customer j immediately after he visits customer i, then he drives directly from i to j."
%C A092186 The solution to the first question is twice A002620(n-1); the solution to the second question is a(n).
