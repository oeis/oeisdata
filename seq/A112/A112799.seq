%N A112799 Least odd number such that all greater odd numbers can be represented as sum of three integers with n distinct prime factors (conjectured).
%C A112799 Strangely, the first 5 values of this sequence are all primes. Meng proves a remarkable generalization of the Goldbach-Vinogradov classical result that every sufficiently large odd integer N can be partitioned as the sum of three primes N = p1 + p2 + p3. The new proof is that every sufficiently large odd integer N can be partitioned as the sum of three integers N = a + b + c where each of a, b, c has k distinct prime factors for the same k.
%C A112799 a(5) = 95539; all odd numbers up to 200000 checked, no larger term found that could not be represented as sum of three integers each with 5 distinct prime factors.
%C A112799 a(1)-a(3): checked odd numbers < 10^5. a(4): checked odd numbers < 10^6. a(5): checked odd numbers < 3*10^6. a(6): checked odd numbers < 3*10^7. a(7): checked odd numbers between 8*10^7 and 2*10^8. [From _Donovan Johnson_, Feb 04 2009]
