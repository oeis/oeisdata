%N A112832 Number of non-intersecting cycle systems in a particular directed graph.
%C A112832 Define a graph with 2n vertices. Vertices 1 through n will be on the top half, vertices n+1 through 2n will be on the bottom half. For 1 <= i < j <=n, create a directed edge from vertex i to vertex j if j-i is either 1 or 2. For n+1<=i<j<=2n, create a directed edge from vertex j to vertex i if j-i is either 1 or 2. Lastly, create a directed edge from i to n+i and vice versa for 1 <= i <= n. (A graph of this general type is called a hamburger.) The value a(n) gives the number of vertex-disjoint unions of directed cycles in this graph. Also calculable as the determinant of an n X n Toeplitz matrix.
%C A112832 For n>=0, the set {A112832(2n+1)} is the intersection of the set of numbers of the form a^2+(a+1)^2 and the set of numbers of the form b^2+5(b+1)^2. - _Kieren MacMillan_, Dec 19 2007
