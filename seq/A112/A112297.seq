%N A112297 A puzzle sequence: given the first six terms, how does the sequence continue?
%C A112297 From _Michael S. Branicky_, Oct 28 2025: (Start)
%C A112297 Original title: A puzzle sequence, answer not known to me.
%C A112297 Answer/spoiler: The given six terms match A380885(47)..A380885(52) so the rule is as follows: 470 is the smallest multiple of 47 containing 4 and 7, 384 is the smallest multiple of 48 containing 4 and 8, 294 is the smallest multiple of 49 containing both 4 and 9, 150 is the smallest multiple of 50 containing 5 and 0, etc. Thus, the sequence continues with 530, 540, ... or A380885(53), A380885(54), ... . _Alonso del Arte_ confirms this was his original intent.
