%N A112801 Number of ways of representing 2n-1 as sum of three integers, each with two distinct prime factors.
%C A112801 Meng proves a remarkable generalization of the Goldbach-Vinogradov classical result that every sufficiently large odd integer N can be partitioned as the sum of three primes N = p1 + p2 + p3. The new proof is that every sufficiently large odd integer N can be partitioned as the sum of three integers N = a + b + c where each of a, b, c has k distinct prime factors for the same k.

%e A112801 a(14) = 1 because the only partition into three integers each with 2 distinct prime factors of (2*14)-1 = 27 is 27 = 6 + 6 + 15 = (2*3) + (2*3) + (3*5).
%e A112801 a(16) = 1 because the only partition into three integers each with 2 distinct prime factors of (2*16)-1 = 31 is 31 = 6 + 10 + 15 = (2*3) + (2*5) + (3*5).
%e A112801 a(17) = 2 because the two partitions into three integers each with 2 distinct prime factors of (2*17)-1 = 33 are 33 = 6 + 6 + 21 = 6 + 12 + 15.
