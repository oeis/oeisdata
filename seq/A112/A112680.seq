%N A112680 Numbers which form exclusively the shortest side of primitive Pythagorean triangles.
%C A112680 Union of A112398 and A112679.
%C A112680 Let S consist of integers x such that x is a term of a primitive Pythagorean triple (ppt).  Consider the equivalence classes induced on S by this relation:  x and y are equivalent if some ppt includes both x and y.  For each class E, let x(E) be the least number in E.  Then (a(n)) is the result of arranging the numbers x(E) in increasing order.  The terms of S can be represented as nodes of a disconnected graph whose components match the classes C.  For example, the component represented by a(1) = 3 starts with
