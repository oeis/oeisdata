%N A304279 Numbers equal to the sum of their aliquot parts, each of them increased by 8.
%C A304279 From _Giovanni Resta_, May 11 2018: (Start)
%C A304279 If p = 2^(1+t) + (1+2*t)*k - 1 is a prime, for some t > 0 and k even, then x = 2^t*p is in the sequence where k is the value by which the sum of aliquot parts is increased.
%C A304279 In this sequence, k = 8; for t = 20 we get 2199366139904, which is a term greater than 2544998588, but this does not exclude the existence of other intermediate terms following a different solution pattern.
%C A304279 In fact, there could also be sporadic solutions of the type x = 2^t*r*q, where r and q are prime and for which no closed form is known. E.g., for k = 8 we have x = 2^14*32771*268460149.
%C A304279 To find them, since d(n) = 4*(t+1) and sigma(n) = (2^(t+1)-1)*(1+r)*(1+q), the relation 2*n = sigma(n) + k*(d(n)-1) becomes 2^(t+1)*r*q = (2^(t+1)-1)*(1+r)*(1+q) + k*(4*t+3), which, for fixed t and k, is a quadratic Diophantine equation in r and q that could admit solutions with r and q prime.
%C A304279 (End)
%C A304279 Terms using odd values of k seem very hard to find. Up to n = 10^12, only three such terms are known: 2, 98, and 8450, for k = 1, 5, and -7, respectively.
%C A304279 Also contains the following terms with 3 or more prime factors: 88589549987497683722466044, 22253858802338837685592562925568, 1268585838029027806341792331830904316, 111673966876069268815909338385797416444, 47631002937472871885713099064506793693544448. - _Max Alekseyev_, Jan 29 2026
