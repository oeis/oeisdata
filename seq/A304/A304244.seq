%N A304244 Numbers that yield a prime when prime(k) is inserted after the k-th digit, for any k >= 1, k < number of digits.
%C A304244 The primes to insert are: 2 (after the first digit), 3 (after the second digit, if there are at least three), etc.
%C A304244 Inspired by A304243 and analog sequences given in cross-references.
%C A304244 The sequence is finite: if insertion of 3 after the second digit yields a prime, then the sum of digits must be congruent to 1 or 2 (mod 3). However, insertion of 2 after the first digit also must yield a prime, so only the second case is possible. But then, insertion of a digit 7 cannot yield a prime, so no term can have 5 digits or more. (Sequence A304243 circumvents this restriction by excluding 3 from the primes to insert, but it is still finite for a similar reason occurring later.)

%e A304244 The 1-digit numbers 0..9 are included since the condition is voidly satisfied: Nothing can be inserted, therefore each of the resulting numbers is prime.
%e A304244 17 is in the sequence because 127 is prime.
%e A304244 101 is in the sequence because 1201 and 1031 are prime.
