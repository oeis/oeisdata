%N A304278 Numbers equal to the sum of their aliquot parts, each of them increased by 6.
%C A304278 From _Giovanni Resta_, May 11 2018: (Start)
%C A304278 If p = 2^(1+t) + (1+2*t)*k - 1 is a prime, for some t > 0 and k even, then x = 2^t*p is in the sequence where k is the value by which the sum of aliquot parts is increased.
%C A304278 In this sequence k = 6 and for t = 20 we get 2199280156672 that is another term greater than 137496887296 but this does not exclude the existence of other intermediate terms following a different solution pattern.
%C A304278 (End)
%C A304278 Terms using odd values of k seem very hard to find. Up to n = 10^12, only three such terms are known: 2, 98, and 8450, for k = 1, 5, and -7, respectively.
