%N A304243 Numbers that yield a prime when prime(k+2) is inserted after the k-th digit (or prime(1) = 2 before the 1st digit for k=0), for 0 <= k <= number of digits.
%C A304243 The primes to insert are 2 (in front) or 5, 7, 11, 13, ... after the number's first, second, third, ... digit. So there cannot be any 1 digit solution because if 5 is appended this cannot yield a prime. One can show that the terms cannnot have more than 21 digits.
%C A304243 The prime 3 is excluded from the strings to insert, because else no term could have more than 2 digits: to be prime with 2 prefixed or with 3 inserted, the number must be congruent to 2 (mod 3), so it cannot be prime with 7 appended or inserted. See also the Rivera link and A304244.

%e A304243 a(1) = 27 because 2|27 = 227, 2|5|7 = 257 and 27|7 = 277 are all prime.
%e A304243 Similarly for a(6) = 333, because 2333, 3533, 3373 and 33311 are all prime.
