%N A264769 Number of cells that are "SURROUNDED" at the n-th stage of the "Ulam-Warburton" two-dimensional cellular automaton.
%C A264769 Previous analysis of this cellular automaton have concentrated on cells that turn "ON". This sequence examines those cells that are never turned ON.
%C A264769 This cellular automaton is generated by Rule 686 using the Wolfram numbering scheme.
%C A264769 A "SURROUNDED" cell is one in which all neighbors have been turned ON but itself is not turned ON.
%C A264769 See A147562 for extensive definitions, references and links for this cellular automaton.
%C A264769 Note that the offset is zero, which implies that the initial cell is at stage n=1. This corresponds to that of A147562 where a(0)=0, a(1)=1, a(2)=5, etc. The Singmaster reference implies a(0)=1, a(1)=5, etc. The choice of offset is arbitrary and neither seems to be ideal.
%C A264769 Observations:
%C A264769 Cells are referenced by their coordinates on the x,y-plane with the initial cell at (0,0).
%C A264769 G(i,j) is the generation where cell (i,j) is turned ON.
%C A264769 P(i,j) is the generation where cell (i,j) is POISONED.
%C A264769 Due to symmetry, analysis of only the (+,+) quadrant is necessary.
%C A264769 G(0,j) = j+1;
%C A264769 G(i,0) = i+1;
%C A264769 G(k,2^n-1-k) = 2^n;
%C A264769 G(2^n-1-k,k) = 2^n;
%C A264769 G(1,j) = j+2, when j is even;
%C A264769 G(i,1) = i+2, when i is even;
%C A264769 P(1,j) = j+1, when j is odd;
%C A264769 P(i,1) = i+1, when i is odd;
%C A264769 P(i,j) = k, when i,j are odd (a formula for k is not known at this time);
%C A264769 P(i,j) = 2^k when i=j>0, k=floor(log_2(i-1))+2.
%C A264769 After iterations 2^k, all cells with i+j<=2^k are either ON or SURROUNDED.
%C A264769 On iterations 2^k+1, only 4 cells turned on: (0,2^k), (2^k,0), (0,-2^k), (-2^k,0).
%C A264769 Newly turned ON cells are always adjacent to one turned ON in the previous generation.
%C A264769 Number of SURROUNDED cells approach 1/2 the number of ON cells as n increases.
