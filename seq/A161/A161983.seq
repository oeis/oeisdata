%N A161983 Irregular triangle read by rows: the group of 2n + 1 integers starting at A014105(n).
%C A161983 The squares of numbers in each row can be gathered in an equation with the first n terms on one side, the next n+1 terms on the other. The third row, for example, could be rendered as 10^2 + 11^2 + 12^2 = 13^2 + 14^2.
%C A161983 This sequence contains all nonnegative integers that are within a distance of n from 2n^2 + 2n where n is any nonnegative integer. The nonnegative integers that are not in this sequence are of the form 2n^2 + k where n is any positive integer and -n <= k <= n-1. Also, when n is the product of two consecutive integers, a(n) = 2n; for example, a(20) = 40. See explicit formulas for the sequence in the formula section below. - _Dennis P. Walsh_, Aug 09 2013
%C A161983 Numbers k with the property that the largest Dyck path of the symmetric representation of sigma(k) has a central valley, n > 0. (Cf. A237593.) - _Omar E. Pol_, Aug 28 2018

%F A161983 As a triangle, T(n,k) = 2n^2 + 2n + k where -n <= k <= n and n = 0,1,... - _Dennis P. Walsh_, Aug 09 2013
%F A161983 As sequence, a(n) = n + floor(sqrt(n))*(floor(sqrt(n)) + 1); equivalently, a(n) = n + A000196(n)*(A000196(n)+1). - _Dennis P. Walsh_, Aug 09 2013
