%N A161604 A positive integer k is included if the value of (the reversal of k's representation in binary) divides k.
%C A161604 By "reversal" of k's representation in binary, it is meant: write k in binary, reverse the order of its digits, and read the result as a binary value.
%C A161604 It seems (verified for the first 120000 entries) that a(n) = A057890(n+1). - _R. J. Mathar_, Jun 18 2009
%C A161604 Indeed, this is A057890 (palindromes with optional trailing zeros) without the initial term. In other bases this does not have to be so, as illustrated by A071687. - _Ivan Neretin_, Sep 04 2015

%e A161604 24 in binary is 11000. The reversal of this is 11 (ignoring leading 0's), which is 3 in decimal. Since 3 divides 24, then 24 is included in this sequence.
