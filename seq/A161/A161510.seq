%N A161510 Number of primes formed as the sum of distinct divisors of n, counted with repetition.
%C A161510 That is, if a number has d divisors, then we compute all 2^d sums of distinct divisors and count how many primes are formed. Sequence A093893 lists the n that produce no primes except for the primes that divide n. The Mathematica code works well for numbers up to about 221760, which has 168 divisors and creates a polynomial of degree 950976. The coefficients of the prime powers of that polynomial sum to 28719307224839120896278355000770621322645671888269, the number of primes formed by the divisors of 221760. Records appear to occur at n=10 and n in A002182, the highly composite numbers.

%e A161510 a(4) = 4 because the divisors (1,2,4) produce 4 primes (2,1+2,1+4,1+2+4).
