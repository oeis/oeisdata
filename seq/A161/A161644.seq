%N A161644 Number of ON states after n generations of cellular automaton based on triangles.
%C A161644 Analog of A151723 and A151725, but here we are working on the hexagonal net where each triangular cell has three neighbors (meeting along its edges). A cell is turned ON if exactly one of its three neighbors is ON. An ON cell remains ON forever.
%C A161644 We start with a single ON cell.
%C A161644 There is a dual version where the triangular cells meet vertex-to-vertex. The counts are the same: the two versions are isomorphic. Reed (1974) uses the vertex-to-vertex version. See the two Sloane "Illustration" links below to compare the two versions.
%C A161644 It appears that a(n) is also the number of polytoothpicks added in a toothpick structure formed by V-toothpicks but starting with a Y-toothpick: a(n) = a(n-1)+(A182632(n)-A182632(n-1))/2. (Checked up to n=39.) - _Omar E. Pol_, Dec 07 2010 and _R. J. Mathar_, Dec 17 2010
%C A161644 It appears that the behavior is similar to A161206. - _Omar E. Pol_, Jan 15 2016
%C A161644 It would be nice to have a formula or recurrence.
%C A161644 If new triangles are required to always move outwards we get A295559 and A295560.
