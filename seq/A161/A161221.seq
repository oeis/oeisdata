%N A161221 Consider necklaces with n beads, each black or white, where the n segments of cord between the beads are each colored red or green; a(n) is the number of different necklaces under the action of the dihedral group D_{2n}.
%C A161221 If the group is changed to C_n we get A001868.
%C A161221 For n>=4 a(n) is the number of ways to color the edges of a wheel graph using at most 2 colors. A wheel graph is a graph that contains a cycle of order n and every graph vertex is connected to one other graph vertex (which is known as the hub).

%F A161221 For n>0, a(n) = (1/2)*( (1/n) * Sum_{d|n} (phi(n/d)*2^(2*d)) + 2^(n+1) ).
%e A161221 a(4) = 51: the following table shows the number of such necklaces with b black beads, 4-b white beads, r red chord segments and 4-r green chord segments. The sum of the numbers is 51.

%e A161221 The number of ways to color the edges of a wheel graph (whose vertices are a 4-cycle and a common hub) so that there are exactly 0,1,2,...8 "red" edges is 1,2,6,10,13,10,6,2,1. This corresponds to the sum of the diagonals in the example above.
