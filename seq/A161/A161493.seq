%N A161493 Positive integers, k, for which k mod d(k) and k have opposite (odd/even) parity, where d(k) is the number of divisors of k.
%C A161493 It appears that the sequence {a(n)} consists entirely of squares. (This has been verified to a(431) = 998001 = 999^2.)
%C A161493 A number k appears in the sequence if and only if k is a square and floor(k/d(k)) is odd. This is because k mod d(k) = k - d(k) * floor(k/d(k)) and d(k) is odd if and only if k is square. - _Hagen von Eitzen_, Jun 12 2009

%e A161493 k=4 has three divisors, so 4 mod d(4) = 1, which is odd. But 4 is even. Therefore 4 is a term of the sequence.
%e A161493 k=25 has three divisors, so 25 mod d(25) = 1, which is odd. 25 is also odd. Therefore 25 is not a term of the sequence.
