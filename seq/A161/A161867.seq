%N A161867 Denominators of ratio of nonprimes in a square interval to that of nonprimes in that interval and its successor.
%H A161867 G. C. Greubel, <a href="/A161867/b161867.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..1000</a>
%F A161867 The limit of this sequence of ratios is 1/2, as can be shown by setting an increasing lower bound on the ratio of composites in successive square intervals.
%e A161867 First few ratios are 1/4, 3/8, 5/11, 2/5, 1/2, 3/7, 12/25, 13/29.
%t A161867 Denominator[Table[((2 n + 1) - (PrimePi[(n + 1)^2] - PrimePi[n^2]))/((4 n + 4) - (PrimePi[(n + 2)^2] - PrimePi[n^2])), {n, 1, 100}]] (* corrected by _G. C. Greubel_, Dec 20 2016 *)
