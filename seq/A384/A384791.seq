%N A384791 Numbers with a record number of ways in which they can be expressed as b^3 * c^4 * d^5, with b, c and d >= 1.
%C A384791 The least term that is not a power of 2 is a(16) = 2^24 * 3^8.
%C A384791 Indices of records of the multiplicative function f(n) with f(p^e) = A008680(e).
%C A384791 All the terms are cubefull numbers since f(1) = 1 and f(n) = 0 if n is a noncubefull number.
%C A384791 The corresponding record values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, ... (see the link for more values).
%C A384791 Every exponent must be the index of the first occurrence of A008680(e) in A008680. So possible exponents of prime factors of terms are 0, 8, 12, 15, 18, 20, ... - _David A. Corneth_, Jun 30 2025

%e A384791 256 in the sequence as 256 = 1^3 * 4^4 * 1^5 = 2^3 * 1^4 * 2^5 so there are two ways to write 256 as b^3 * c^4 * d^5, with b, c and d >= 1 and no smaller positive integer can be written in at least two ways like that. - _David A. Corneth_, Jun 30 2025
