%N A173726 Number of reduced, normalized 3x3 semimagic squares with magic sum n.
%C A173726 In a semimagic square the row and column sums must all equal the magic sum. The symmetries are permutation of rows and columns and reflection in a diagonal. A "reduced" square has least entry 0. There is one normalized square for each symmetry class of reduced squares. See A173725 for a general normal form. a(n) is given by a quasipolynomial of degree 4 and period 840.

%e A173726 a(12) is the first term because the values 0,...,8 make magic sum 12. a(12)=1 because there is only one normal form with values 0 to 8: (by rows) 0,4,8;5,6,1;7,2,3. a(13)=2 because the values 0,...,5,7,8,9 give two normal forms: 0,4,9;5,7,1;8,2,3 and 0,4,9;5,7,1;8,2,3.
