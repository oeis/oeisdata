%N A173727 Number of reduced 3 X 3 semimagic squares with distinct nonnegative integer entries and maximum entry n.
%C A173727 In a semimagic square the row and column sums must all be equal (the "magic sum"). A reduced square has least entry 0.
%C A173727 a(n) is given by a quasipolynomial of degree 5 and period 60.

%e A173727 For n=8 the cells contain 0,...,8, which have one semimagic arrangement up to symmetry. All examples are obtained by symmetries from (by rows): 0, 5, 7; 4, 6, 2; 8, 1, 3.
%e A173727 For n=9 the cells contain all of 0,...,9 except 3 or 6, since 0 and 9 must be used; each selection has one semimagic arrangement up to symmetry.
%Y A173727 Cf. A173546, A173723, A173724. A173728 counts reduced squares by magic sum.
