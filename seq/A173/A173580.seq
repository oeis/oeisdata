%C A173580 It's possible to use the present sequence for messages coding by the choice of words code such as the Hamming distance (dH) is maximum, for example, with the code (12841,20101,41221,84011), dH = 8, but after error, the decoding with the maximum likelihood is alone insufficient. Then, we use the property of "prime number word-code" for improve the decoding.
