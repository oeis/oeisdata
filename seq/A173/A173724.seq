%N A173724 Number of reduced, normalized 3 X 3 semimagic squares with distinct nonnegative integer entries and maximum entry n.
%C A173724 In a semimagic square the row and column sums must all be equal (the "magic sum"). A "reduced" square has least entry 0. There is one normalized square for each symmetry class of reduced squares (symmetry under permutation of rows and columns and reflection in a diagonal). a(n) is given by a quasipolynomial of degree 5 and period 60.

%e A173724 For n=8 the cells contain 0,...,8, which have one semimagic arrangement up to symmetry. For n=9 the cells contain all of 0,...,9 except 3 or 6, since 0 and 9 must be used; each selection has one semimagic arrangement up to symmetry.
