%N A173934 Irregular triangle in which row n consists of numbers m < k/2 such that m/k is in the Cantor set, where k= A173931(n) and gcd(m,k) = 1.
%C A173934 The length of row n is A173933(n). Observe that the m are actually less than k/3. Note that (k-m)/k is also in the Cantor set. If m appears in a row, then 3m does also. Let A and B be the first and last numbers in row n, then it appears that k = A + 3B. This implies A = k (mod 3). The interesting graph of this triangle shows that some ranges of m are not allowed.
%C A173934 When k is a prime of the form (3^r-1)/2, then the row consists of the 2^(r-1)-1 numbers (greater than 0) whose base-3 representation consists of only 0's and 1's. Hence, for r=3,7, and 13, the primes k are 13, 1093, and 797161, and the number of m < k/2 is 3, 63, and 4095.
