%N A173723 Number of symmetry classes of 3 X 3 semimagic squares with distinct positive values < n.
%C A173723 In a semimagic square the row and column sums must all be equal (the "magic sum"). Symmetry is up to permutation of rows and columns and reflection in a diagonal. a(n) is given by a quasipolynomial of degree 5 and period 60.

%e A173723 For a(10) the cells contain the nine integers from 1 to 9, which can be arranged in 1 way to make a magic square, up to symmetry. For a(11) the cells contain nine of the ten integers from 1 to 10. The omitted number can only be 1, 4, 7, or 10. Each selection of numbers can be arranged in 1 way, up to symmetry.
%Y A173723 Cf. A173546, A173724. A173725 counts symmetry types by magic sum.
