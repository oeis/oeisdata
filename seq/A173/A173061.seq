%N A173061 Arises in classification of base sequences.
%C A173061 Column 2 of Djokovic, p.3, Table 1: Number of equivalence classes of BS(n + 1, n). From the abstract of the paper: "Base sequences BS(n+1,n) are quadruples of {1,-1}-sequences (A;B;C;D), with A and B of length n+1 and C and D of length n, such that the sum of their nonperiodic autocorrelation functions is a delta-function. The base sequence conjecture, asserting that BS(n+1,n) exist for all n, is stronger than the famous Hadamard matrix conjecture. We introduce a new definition of equivalence for base sequences BS(n+1,n) and construct a canonical form. By using this canonical form, we have enumerated the equivalence classes of BS(n+1,n) for n <= 30. Due to excessive size of the equivalence classes, the tables in the paper cover only the cases n <= 12."
