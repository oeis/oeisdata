%N A173027 Numbers of rows R of the Wythoff array such that R is the n-th multiple of a tail of the Fibonacci sequence.
%C A173027 Row 1 of the array A173028.
%C A173027 Contribution from _K. G. Stier_, Dec 08 2012: (Start)
%C A173027 It appears that the numbers of this sequence form groups of m members respectively with same distance d of two consecutive values a(n) such that d is equal to even-indexed Fibonacci numbers (A001906) while m is equal to even-indexed Lucas numbers (A005248). Example: from n=1365 to 3571 d=987 and m=2207;
%C A173027 Also of interest are the gaps between two consecutive groups which appear to be sums of Fibonacci numbers F(2*n) plus F(4*n-2). Example: gap 5 after a(76) is 2639 = F(10) + F(18) = 55 + 2584.
%C A173027 Likewise, the tail (as mentioned in this sequence's name) of the Fibonacci sequence is chopped off by two initial terms at each of the gap positions. (End)
