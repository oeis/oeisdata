%N A220514 D-toothpick sequence of the third kind starting with a X-shaped cross formed by 4 D-toothpicks.
%C A220514 This is a toothpick sequence of forking paths to 135 degrees. The sequence gives the number of toothpicks and D-toothpicks in the structure after n-th stage. A221528 (the first differences) give the number of toothpicks or D-toothpicks added at n-th stage. It appears that the structure has a fractal (or fractal-like) behavior. For more information see A194700.
%C A220514 First differs from A194434 at a(13).
