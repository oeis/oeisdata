%N A220272 Number of ways to write n=x^2+y (x>0, y>0) with 2*x*y-1 prime.
%C A220272 Conjecture: a(n)>0 for all n>2.
%C A220272 This has been verified for n up to 3*10^9. The author observed that for each n=3,...,3*10^9 we may even require x<(log n)^2, but Jack Brennen found that for n=4630581798 we cannot require x<(log n)^2.
%C A220272 The author guessed that the conjecture can be slightly refined as follows: Any integer n>2 can be written as x^2+y with 2*x*y-1 prime, where x and y are positive integers with x<=y.
%C A220272 Zhi-Wei Sun also made the following general conjecture: If m is a positive integer and r is 1 or -1, then any sufficiently large integer n can be written as x^2+y (x>0, y>0) with m*x*y+r prime.
%C A220272 For example, for (m,r)=(1,-1),(1,1),(2,1),(3,-1),(3,1),(4,-1),(4,1),(5,-1),(5,1),(6,-1),(6,1), it suffices to require that n is greater than 12782, 15372, 488, 5948, 2558, 92, 822, 21702, 6164, 777, 952 respectively.
