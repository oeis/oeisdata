%N A220572 Number of ways to write 2n-1=x+y (x,y>=0) with x^18+3*y^18 prime.
%C A220572 Conjecture: a(n)>0 for every n=1,2,3,.... Moreover, any odd integer greater than 2092 can be written as x+y (x,y>0) with x-3, x+3 and x^18+3*y^18 all prime.
%C A220572 This has been verified for n up to 2*10^6.
%C A220572 Zhi-Wei Sun also made the following general conjecture: For each positive integer m, any sufficiently large odd integer n can be written as x+y (x,y>0) with x-3, x+3 and x^m+3*y^m all prime (and hence there are infinitely many primes in the form x^m+3*y^m). In particular, for m = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 18 any odd integer greater than one can be written as x+y (x,y>0) with x^m+3*y^m prime, and for m =1, 2, 3 any odd integer n>15 can be written as x+y (x,y>0) with x-3, x+3 and x^m+3*y^m all prime.
%C A220572 Our computation suggests that for each m=7,...,20 any odd integer greater than 32, 10, 24, 30, 48, 36, 72, 146, 48, 48, 152, 2, 238, 84 respectively can be written as x+y (x,y>0) with x^m+3*y^m prime.
