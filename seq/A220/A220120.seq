%N A220120 Bases having a record-sized smallest prime such that there are two smaller primes with which all 6 ways of juxtaposition in the base are prime.
%C A220120 Ties occur with bases 13 and 1553, which are detailed in the EXAMPLE section for completeness.  See A220121 for the rest of the data.
%e A220120 In base 13, for any triple of primes under 103--the record corresponding to a(3)=12--at least 1 of the ways of stringing the primes together gives a composite; but {11,73,103} is a set giving primes all 6 ways: In base 13, these 3 primes are written B, 58 and 7C; and {587CB, 58B7C, 7C58B, 7CB58, B587C, B7C58} in base 13 corresponds to decimal {161731, 162343, 227251, 228223, 326611, 331651} (all of which are prime).
%e A220120 Base 1553 also ties the record set by base a(18)=1097, with no triple of primes under 1061 giving just primes, while the triple {197, 911, 1061} does.
