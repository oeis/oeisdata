%N A220413 Number of ways to write n=x+y (x>=0, y>=0) with x^3+2*y^3 prime.
%C A220413 Conjecture: a(n)>0 for every n=1,2,3,... Moreover, any integer n>3 not among 7, 22, 31 can be written as p+q (q>0) with p and p^3+2*q^3 both prime.
%C A220413 We have verified this conjecture for n up to 10^8. D. R. Heath-Brown proved in 2001 that there are infinitely many primes in the form x^3+2*y^3, where x and y are positive integers.
%C A220413 Zhi-Wei Sun also made the following general conjecture: For each positive odd integer m, any sufficiently large integer n can be written as x+y (x>=0, y>=0) with x^m+2*y^m prime.
%C A220413 When m=1, this follows from Bertrand's postulate proved by Chebyshev in 1850. For m = 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, it suffices to require that n is greater than 46, 69, 141, 274, 243, 189, 320, 454 respectively.
