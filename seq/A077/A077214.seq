%N A077214 a(1) = 1. a(n+1) is the smallest number which is greater than a(n), coprime to it and has a different prime signature.
%C A077214 Subsidiary sequence: First occurrence of a difference n between successive terms. Conjecture : the maximum value of a(k+1) - a(k) = 7 that too occurs only once for k = 2.( i.e. the subsidiary sequence has only 7 terms.)
%C A077214 I conjecture that a(n+1)-a(n) is unbounded. The simplest way to get such a gap is to find n divisible by lcm(1,2,...,k) where n+1 has the same prime signature as n. I expect that such numbers exist, although they are likely to be quite large. (Since n-1 lacks small divisors, it is very likely to be in the sequence and so n is also very likely to be in the sequence.) Note that the sequence includes every prime except 3, 5 and 7. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Jul 18 2006
%C A077214 The prime signatures used here are sorted, so that 75 = 3*5^2 is considered to have the same signature as 76 = 2^2*19. - _Sean A. Irvine_, May 11 2025
