%N A077154 Smallest k such that there are as many composite numbers less than n as there are between n and k.
%C A077154 For n>3, the sequence lists 1 plus every composite number A002808(m), except for those A002808(2m) where A002808(m)+1 is also composite. E.g. 13 = 12+1 is not present because 12 is A002808(6) and A002808(3)+1 = 8+1 = 9 is composite. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Oct 11 2006

%e A077154 a(1) = 2 because between 1 and 2 there is the same number of composites (none) as below 1. - _R. J. Mathar_, Sep 08 2008
%e A077154 For n = 12, there are 5 composites less than 12 (4,6,8,9,10), the next 5 composites are 14,15,16,18,20, so a(12) = 21.
