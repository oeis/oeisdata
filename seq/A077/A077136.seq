%N A077136 Composite numbers n whose proper divisors (excluding 1 and n) are all of the form p or p+1, with p prime.
%C A077136 k is a member if (1) k = p*q p, q are primes. (2) k = 4*p and p, 2p-1 are primes. Are there any other prime signatures k could take?
%C A077136 The only numbers in the sequence that are neither a semiprime nor of the form 4p (where 2p-1 is also prime) are 16 and 24. If n has pq as a proper divisor, with p and q odd primes (not necessarily distinct), neither pq nor pq-1 can be prime. Likewise 16 cannot be a proper factor. Other than the two specified cases, this leaves n = 8p, where 2p-1 and 4p-1 are primes. p = 2 or 3 gives the exceptional cases 16 and 24, respectively. Any other prime must be == 1 or 2 (mod 3); if 1, then 4p-1 is divisible by 3 and if 2, then 2p-1 is divisible by 3. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Jul 28 2007
