%N A156097 Number of rigid genus-2 bipartite crystallizations of orientable 3-manifolds with 2n vertices.
%C A156097 This is the upper row of Table 1, p.9, of Bandieri, et al. There are no rigid genus two crystallizations with less than 14 vertices (i.e., with n = 7). Abstract: "We improve and extend to the non-orientable case a recent result of Karabas, Malicki and Nedela concerning the classification of all orientable prime 3-manifolds of Heegaard genus two, triangulated with at most 42 coloured tetrahedra." Karabas, Malicki and Nedela show that there exist exactly 78 non-homeomorphic, closed, orientable, prime 3-manifolds with Heegaard genus two, admitting a colored triangulation with at most 42 tetrahedra. Each manifold M is identified by a suitable 6-tuple of nonnegative integers, representing a minimal crystallization - hence a minimal colored triangulation - of M. From such a 6-tuple, a presentation of the fundamental group and of the first homology group of M are easily obtained.
