%N A156284 From every interval (2^(m-1), 2^m), m >= 3, we remove primes p for which 2^m-p is a prime that was not removed for smaller values of m; the sequence gives all remaining odd primes.
%C A156284 Powers of 2 are not expressible as sums of two primes from this sequence. This is attained by a more economical algorithm than that for construction of A152451. If A(x) is the counting function for the terms a(n) <= x, then A(x) = pi(x) - O(x/(log^2(x)). It is known that the approximation of pi(x) by x/log(x) gives the remainder term as, at best, O(x/log^2(x)). Therefore beginning our process from m >= M (with arbitrarily large M), we obtain a sequence which essentially is indistinguishable from the sequence of all odd primes with the help of the approximation of pi(x) by x/log(x). Hence it is in principle impossible to prove the binary Goldbach conjecture by such an approximation of pi(x).
