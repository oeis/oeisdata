%N A156055 Define a map f by f(0) = f(1) = 0, otherwise f(k) = A087712(k); then a(n) is the number of steps for the trajectory of n under repeated iteration of f to "terminate".
%C A156055 Here "terminate" means reaching 0 or a cycle.
%C A156055 From _M. F. Hasler_, Feb 11 2009: (Start)
%C A156055 "Reaching a cycle" could be better defined: does it mean "reach a value that occurred earlier" or "reach an element belonging to a cycle"?
%C A156055 I think the second is the case, but the value 0 is currently listed at n=14, wouldn't it correspond to x=15 = least element of a nontrivial cycle?
%C A156055 So would the offset be 2 ? or is there a missing term (since the first terms 1,2,3 seem well to correspond to x=1,2,3)? (End)
