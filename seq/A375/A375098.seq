%N A375098 Diagonals of a Euclidian solid such that there exists a Pythagorean quadruple d^2=a^2+b^2+c^2 that is more cube-like than any prior value of d.
%C A375098 To determine how "cube-like" a Pythagorean quad is, we use the quotient C/(C-a*b*c) where C is the volume of an ideal cube for a given diagonal d, C=(d/sqrt(3))^3. A ratio of 100 indicates that the best {a,b,c} combination creates a solid 1 part per 100 smaller than the ideal cube volume.
%C A375098 Contains all the terms in A001835 and A079935 except the leading 1s. For such a term b(m) contained in a(n) from those sequences, 2*b(m) will tie the current record, while 3*b(m) will tie but will also break the current record exactly half the time and thus appear as a(n+1). This means round((2+sqrt(3))*b(m)) will also be in the sequence as either a(n+1) or a(n+2) if a better quad for 3*b(n) was found.
%C A375098 The constant (2+sqrt(3)) follows from the recurrence relationship b(n)=4*b(n-1)-b(n-2). The constant can be represented as the continued fraction 3,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,.... The equivalents for the 2D case (A001653) are 3+2*sqrt(2) and {5,1,4,1,4,1,4,1,4,...}.
%C A375098 We conjecture this method provides complete solutions. This was confirmed directly by brute-force testing up to 1e7 (optimized using the sum-of-two-squares theorem for a given d^2-a^2 = b^2 + c^2; see link below).

%F A375098 For n == 0 (mod 3), a(n) = 4*a(n-2)-a(n-3) OR a(n) = floor(a(n-1)*(2+sqrt(3))/3),
%F A375098 For n == 1 (mod 3), a(n) = 4*a(n-2)-a(n-1) OR a(n) = floor(a(n-1)*(2+sqrt(3))),
%F A375098 For n == 2 (mod 3), a(n) = 3*a(n-1).
%e A375098 3 is in the sequence because 3^2=1^2+2^2+2^2 is the smallest Pythagorean quad, with an error of one part in 4.344.
%e A375098 6 is NOT in the sequence because {6,2,4,4} is the most cube-like Pythagorean quad, but only ties the previous record without breaking it.
%e A375098 7 is NOT in the sequence because the most cube-like quad {7,2,3,6} has an error of one part in 2.2, worse than that for d=3.
%e A375098 9 is in the sequence NOT because of {9,3,6,6} which ties the previous record, but because {9,4,4,7} improves on the previous record with an error of one part in 4.958.
