%N A375249 Integers which cannot be partitioned into the sum of a hexagonal number plus a pentagonal number, nor a hexagonal number plus a square, nor a pentagonal number plus a square.
%C A375249 Inspired by A160324 and analogous to A020757.
%C A375249 C. F. Gauss proved that all positive integers can be expressed as the sum of three triangular numbers. However, Zhi-Wei Sun (2009) has shown that there are 95 candidates for universal triples. This sequence looks at the {p4, p5, p6} triples and ask which integers require all three members to satisfy the sum.
%C A375249 Obviously, a(n) cannot be either a square, a pentagonal number, nor a hexagonal number.
%C A375249 There are more terms less than some integer in A020757 than in this sequence. In a sense, a square plus a pentagonal plus a hexagonal number is more efficient than the sum of three triangular numbers.
%C A375249 a(n) =~ 5.14 n^(.97).

%e A375249 7 is not in the sequence since the third hexagonal number 6 plus the second square or pentagonal number sum to 7;
%e A375249 8 is in the sequence because s = {0, 1, 4}, p = {0, 1, 5}, and h = {0, 1, 6} with no two sets having members which sum to 8.
