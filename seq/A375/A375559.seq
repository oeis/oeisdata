%N A375559 L starts out as the list of positive integers; at the n-th iteration, a(n) is set to L(1); then L(1) is moved to its new position in L, in between the first two elements that it has never before been next to; repeat at the second step.
%C A375559 Terms and correct definition by _Ruud H.G. van Tol_ via SeqFan.
%C A375559 This sequence was called The Bad Neighbors sequence on the SeqFan list.
%C A375559 In the beginning, we insert L(1) between L(n+1) and L(n+2), but after a few steps, that doesn't work anymore because L(1) finds closer places between new neighbors.
%e A375559 In a list of positive integers, no one wants to stay near their old neighbors. 1 doesn't want to stay near 2 anymore, so, it inserts itself between 3 and 4: 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ...
%e A375559 a(1) = 1
%e A375559 2 doesn't want to stay near 3 nor 1, so, it inserts itself between 4 and 5: 3, 1, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, ... .
%e A375559 a(2) = 2
%e A375559 3 doesn't want to stay near 2 nor 4 nor 1, so, it inserts itself between 5 and 6: 1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6, 7, 8, ... .
%e A375559 a(3) = 3
%e A375559 Now, 1 doesn't want to stay near 2 nor 3 nor 4, so, it inserts itself between 7 and 8: 4, 2, 5, 3, 6, 7, 1, 8, ... .
%e A375559 a(4) = 1
%e A375559 And so on.
