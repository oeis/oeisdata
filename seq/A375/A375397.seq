%N A375397 Numbers divisible by the square of some prime factor except (possibly) the least. Non-hooklike numbers.
%C A375397 Contains no squarefree numbers A005117 or prime powers A000961, but some perfect powers A131605.
%C A375397 Also numbers k such that the minima of the maximal anti-runs in the weakly increasing sequence of prime factors of k (with multiplicity) are not identical. Here, an anti-run is a sequence with no adjacent equal parts, and the minima of the maximal anti-runs in a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal anti-run subsequences and taking the least term of each. Note the prime factors can alternatively be taken in weakly decreasing order.
%C A375397 Includes all terms of A036785 = non-products of a squarefree number and a prime power.
%e A375397 The prime factors of 300 are {2,2,3,5,5}, with maximal anti-runs ((2),(2,3,5),(5)), with minima (2,2,5), so 300 is in the sequence.
