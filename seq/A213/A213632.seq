%N A213632 Primes p such that primality of (p+p')/2+4 and of (p+p')/2-4 differ, where p'=precprime(p-1), the next smaller prime.
%C A213632 It is easily checked that for m=(p+p')/2 (average between two consecutive primes), the numbers m +- 1 resp. m +- 2 resp. m +- 3 (as well as m +- 6) are (in each case) either both prime or both composite (for p > 7). Thus, m +- 4 provides the least counterexample to this behavior, and the primes listed here are those for which the property does not hold, i.e., one among { m-4, m+4 } is prime and the other one is composite.
