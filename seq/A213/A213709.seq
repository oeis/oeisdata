%N A213709 Number of steps to go from 2^(n+1)-1 to (2^n)-1 using the iterative process described in A071542.
%C A213709 Also, apart from the first term a(0)=1, the number of terms in A179016 whose binary width is n+2 bits and whose second most significant bit is zero. For example, there is one term 4 (100) in three-bit range; two terms 8 (1000) and 11 (1011) in four bit range; three such terms: 16 (10000), 19 (10011) and 23 (10111) in five-bit range; five terms: 32, 35, 39, 42, 46 in six-bit range. This stems from the half-recursive nature of A179016, especially, that for all n >= 4, a(n) also gives the number of steps to go from (2^(n+1) + 2^n + 1) to 2^n using the iterative process described in A071542. Cf. also A226060. - _Antti Karttunen_, Jun 12 2013

%F A213709 a(n) = A071542((2^(n+1))-1) - A071542((2^n)-1).
%F A213709 a(n) = A218542(n) + A218543(n) =  A011782(n) - A213722(n).
%e A213709 (2^0)-1 (0) is reached from (2^1)-1 (1) with one step by subtracting A000120(1) from 1.
%e A213709 (2^1)-1 (1) is reached from (2^2)-1 (3) with one step by subtracting A000120(3) from 3.
%e A213709 (2^2)-1 (3) is reached from (2^3)-1 (7) with two steps by first subtracting A000120(7) from 7 -> 4, and then subtracting A000120(4) from 4 -> 3.
%e A213709 Thus a(0)=a(1)=1 and a(2)=2.
