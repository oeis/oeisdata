%N A213942 a(n) is the number of representative two-color bracelets (necklaces with turnover allowed) with n beads for n >= 2.
%C A213942 This is the second column (m=2) of triangle A213940.
%C A213942 The relevant floor(n/2) representative color multinomials are c[1]^(n-1)*c[2], c[1]^(n-2)*c[2]^2, ..., c[1]^(n-floor(n/2))* c[2]^(floor(n/2)). For such representative bracelets the color c[1] is therefore preferred. Only for even n can c[2] appear as often as c[1], namely, n/2 times.
%C A213942 Note that beads with different colors are always present. This is in contrast to, e.g., A000029, where not only representatives but also one-color bracelets are counted. This sequences gives the number of binary bracelets with at least as many 0's as 1's and at least one 1 (bracelet analog of A226881). The number of two-color bracelets up to permutations of colors is given by A056357. For odd n these two sequences are equal. For a(8), the bracelets 00011011 and 11100100 are equivalent in A056357 but distinct in this sequence. - _Andrew Howroyd_ and _Wolfdieter Lang_, Sep 25 2017

%F A213942 a(n) = A213940(n,2), n >= 2.
%F A213942 a(n) = Sum_{k=2..A008284(n,2)+1} A213939(n,k), n >= 2, with A008284(n,2) = floor(n/2).
%F A213942 a(2n) = (A000029(2n) + A005648(n)) / 2 - 1, a(2n+1) = A000029(2n+1) / 2 - 1. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Sep 25 2017
%e A213942 a(5) = A213939(5,2) + A213939(5,3) = 1 + 2 = 3 from the representative bracelets (with colors j for c[j], j=1,2) cyclic(11112), cyclic(11122) and cyclic(11212). The first one has color signature (exponents) [4,1] and the two others have signature [3,2]. For the number of all two-color 5-bracelets with beads of five colors available see A214308(5) = 60.
%e A213942 a(8) = 18 =  1 + 4 + 5 + 8 for the partitions of 8 with 2 parts (7,1), (6, 2), (5,3), (4,4), respectively. see A213939(5, k), k = 2..5). The 8 representative bracelets for the exponents (signature) from partition (4,4) are B1 = (11112222), B2 = (11121222), B3 = (11212122), B4 = (11212212), B5 = (11221122), B6 = (12121212), B7 = (11122122) and B8 = (11211222). B1 to B6 are color exchange (1 <-> 2) invariant (modulo D_8 symmetry, i.e., cyclic or anti-cyclic operations). B7 is equivalent to B8 under color exchange.
%e A213942 This explains why A056357(8) = 17. The difference between the present sequence and A056357 is that there, besides D_n symmetry, also color exchange is allowed. Here only color exchange compatible with D_n symmetry is allowed. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Sep 28 2017
