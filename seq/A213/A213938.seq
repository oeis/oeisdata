%N A213938 The n-th multiset representative in Abramowitz-Stegun order is a partition of a(n).
%C A213938 The repetition class of a multiset is determined by a finite list of nonincreasing positive integers [e[1], e[2],..., e[m]], which satisfy e[1] >= e[2] >= ... >= e[m] >=1. This list will be called multiset signature (mss). The empty multiset has as signature the empty list [] by definition. The repetition class for given signature depends on the repertoire of the m distinct objects, which will here be positive numbers. The order (cardinality) of each multiset in the repetition class is n:=sum(e[j],j=1..m). This will be called n-multiset with m distinct numbers. In sets the order of elements is irrelevant, and we use the convention to write a set of numbers as a list of nondecreasing numbers. As a multiset representative (msr) we chose among the members of a repetition class the one whose list entries sum to the least value. Thus the repertoire is I_m:=[1, 2, ..., m] for the above given signature.
%C A213938 Partitions of n>=1 (the empty partition could be included for n=0), listed in Abramowitz-Stegun (A-St) order, like on pp. 831-2 of this handbook, (see A036036 for the reference, and a link to a historic paper by C. F. Hindenburg from 1779) can be used as signature if the parts are listed nonincreasingly. This is the reverse of the explicit form of a partition as given in A-St. E.g., 1^2,3 = [1,1,3] in A-St is reversed, to obtain [3,1,1] which is a signature with m=3, e[1]=3, e[2]=1 and e[3]=1. This could be called partrev(n,m,j), if the j-th partition of n with m parts, in A-St order, is labeled part(n,m,j). The empty partition could be included for n=0=m, part(0,0,1). We use partrev(n,m,j)=mss(n,m,j) for the multiset signature related to the reversed partition. The empty multiset would be the empty list [] = mss(0,0,1). In the given example the msr is then msr(5,3,1)= [1^3,2^1,3^1] = [1,1,1,2,3]. This msr is itself a partition (in the A-St version, with nondecreasing parts) of  N=8. Each (nonempty) msr(n,m,j) arises thus from the partition pa(n,m,j) by reversion and 'exponentiation'. Therefore, one can carry the A-St ordering of partitions over to the msrs. This leads to an A-St type ordering of the msrs: for each increasing order n the number of distinct elements m runs from m=1,2, ...,n, and lexicographic ordering is used for msrs with the same n and the same m values. This is done in the link, Table 1, for the first 194 msrs (omitting the empty multiset), corresponding to all partitions of n, for n=1, 2, ..., 11. msr(n,m,j) (also counted as msr(k), k=1, 2, ..., 194) is a partition of N = N(n,m,j) (or N = N(k)), given a s first entry in the 2-list [N,l] there. Note that the empty multiset is not a partition of 0, it corresponds to the empty partition. The second entry l tells that this N appears for the l-th time. E.g., msr(5,3,2)] = msr(16)= [1,1,2,2,3] belongs to the signature mss partrev(5,3,2) = [2,2,1], and is a partition of N=9, and this is the first time (l=1) that 9 appears (the next time is for k=22 or [n,m,j]= [6,2,3]. In this notation the present sequence is N=N(k), k>=1. Here we use k-> n,  N->a(n), therefore the above n, m, j should be renamed n', m', j'.
%C A213938 In the link, Table 2, we have given another list of msrs, counted by q=1, 2, ..., where the A-St list of (nonempty) partitions is scanned for those who are themselves multiset representatives (when one writes the A-St partition as a list, e.g., pa(5,3,2) = [1,2,2]. Table 2 shows this list for all msrs among all partitions of N=1, 2, ..., 20. This means that  qmax=192. In A176723 we gave the characteristic array for these msrs, called there multiset representative defining partitions, and in link there we listed the first 86 (q=1..86) of them, from N=1,..,15.

%F A213938 The n-th representative of the repetition class of multisets defined by the signature obtained from the n-th partition of positive integers in Abramowitz-Stegun (A-St) order is a partition of a(n), n >= 1.
%e A213938 a(1) = 1 because the first (nonempty) multiset representative (msr) is [1], a partition of 1.
%e A213938 a(5) = 4 because the fifth msr is [1, 1, 2] (from the fifth partition [1, 2] in A-St order and signature [2, 1]), and this is a partition of 5.
