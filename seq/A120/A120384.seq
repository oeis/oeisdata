%N A120384 Isolated primes: geometric mean of distances of a prime to neighboring primes sets record.
%C A120384 A096265 is based on arithmetic mean or total distance to neighbors. But it doesn't say if it is isolated from them or close to one of them.

%e A120384 a(4) = 23 because the distance (geometric mean) to its neighbors (19 and 29) equals = sqrt(4*6) = 4.8989. No smaller prime is more isolated. The next more isolated prime a(5) is 53.
