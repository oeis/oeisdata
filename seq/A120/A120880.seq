%N A120880 G.f. satisfies: A(x) = A(x^3)*(1 + 2*x + x^2); thus a(n) = 2^A062756(n), where A062756(n) is the number of 1's in the ternary expansion of n.
%C A120880 More generally, if g.f. of {a(n)} satisfies: A(x) = A(x^3)*(1 + b*x + c*x^2), then a(n) = b^A062756(n)*c^A081603(n), where A062756(n) is the number of 1's and A081603(n) is the number of 2's, in the ternary expansion of n. This sequence is not the same as A059151.
%C A120880 a(n) is the number of entries in the n-th row of Pascal's triangle that are congruent to 1 mod 3 minus the number of entries that are congruent to 2 mod 3. - _N. Sato_, Jun 22 2007 (see Liu (1991))
%C A120880 This sequence pertains to genotype Punnett square mathematics. Start with X = 1. Each hybrid cross involves the equation X:2X:X. Therefore, the ratio in the first (mono) hybrid cross is X=1:2X=2(1) or 2:X=1; or 1:2:1. When you move up to the next hybridization level, replace the previous cross ratio with X. X now represents 3 numbers—1:2:1. Therefore, the ratio in the second (di) hybrid cross is X = (1:2:1):2X = [2(1):2(2):2(1)] or (2:4:2):X = (1:2:1). Put it together and you get 1:2:1:2:4:2:1:2:1. Each time you move up a hybridization level, replace the previous ratio with X, and use the same equation—X:2X:X to get its ratio. - _John Michael Feuk_, Dec 10 2011
