%N A120988 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of binary trees with n edges and such that the first leaf in the preorder traversal is at level k (1<=k<=n). A binary tree is a rooted tree in which each vertex has at most two children and each child of a vertex is designated as its left or right child.
%C A120988 Row sums are the Catalan numbers (A000108).
%F A120988 T(n,k) = Sum_{j=0..k} j*binomial(k,j)*binomial(2n-2k+j,n-k)/(2n-2k+j).
%F A120988 T(n,1) = A000108(n-1) for n>=2 (the Catalan numbers).
%F A120988 T(n,n) = 2^n.
%F A120988 Sum_{k=1..n} k*T(n,k) = A120989(n).
%F A120988 G.f.: 1/(1-t*z*(1+C)), where C = (1-sqrt(1-4*z))/(2*z) is the Catalan function.
%e A120988 T(2,1) = 1 because we have the tree /\.
