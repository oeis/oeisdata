%N A120100 Integers n for which the period of the decimal expansion of 1/n is 6.
%C A120100 The initial terms in the sequence are multiples of either 7 or 13, but the sequence is not exclusively so. a(45) = 297 whose factors include neither 7 nor 13. Next is a(57) = 407 whose factors are 11 and 37.
%e A120100 a(1) = 7 because 1/7 = 0.142857142857142857+, whose repeating decimal (142857) is 6 digits long.
%e A120100 a(57) = 407 because 1/407 = 0.0024570024570024+, whose repeating decimal (002457) is 6 digits long.
