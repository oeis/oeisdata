%C A120160 Conjecture 1: a(n) equals the number of multiples of 4 whose representation in base 5/4 (see A024634) has n-1 digits. For example, a(8) = 3 because there are three multiples of 4 with n-1 = 7 digits in their representation in base 5/4: 36 = 4321031, 40 = 4321420, and 44 = 4321424.
%C A120160 Conjecture 2: a(n) equals 1/5 times the number of nonnegative integers with the property that their 5/4-expansion has n digits (assuming that the 5/4-expansion of 0 has 1 digit). For example, a(7)*5 = 10 because the following 10 numbers have 5/4 expansions with n = 7 digits: 35 = 4321030, 36 = 4321031, 37 = 4321032, 38 = 4321033, 39 = 4321034, 40 = 4321420, 41 = 4321421, 42 = 4321422, 43 = 4321423, and 44 = 4321424.

%C A120160 Starting at a(11) = 5, we conjecture that this sequence gives all those numbers m for which when we place m persons on a circle, label them 1 through m, start counting at person number 1, and remove every 5th person, the last survivors have numbers in {1, 2, 3, 4}.
%C A120160 When m = 6, 12, 15, 37, 58, 142, 222, 347, ... the last survivor is person 1.
%C A120160 When m = 5, 19, 91, 434, 1656, 2070, 5054, ... the last survivor is person 2.
%C A120160 When m = 8, 10, 24, 30, 73, 114, 178, 278, ... the last survivor is person 3.
%C A120160 When m = 47, 543, 2588, 3235, 6318, 58838, ... the last survivor is person 4. (End)

%e A120160 We explain why 6 and 8 belong to the sequence related to the Josephus problem (for the case k = 5) while 7 does not.
%e A120160 When we place m = 6 people on a circle, label them 1 through 6, start counting at person 1, and remove every 5th person, the list of people we remove is 5 -> 4 -> 6 -> 2 -> 3. Thus the last survivor is person 1, so 6 belongs to this sequence.
%e A120160 When we place m = 7 people on a circle, label them 1 through 7, start counting at person 1, and remove every 5th person, the list of people we remove is 5 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 7 -> 1. Thus the last survivor is person 6 (not in {1, 2, 3, 4}), so 7 does not belong to this sequence.
%e A120160 When we place m = 8 people on a circle, label them 1 through 8, start the counting at person 1, and remove every 5th person, the list of people we remove is 5 -> 2 -> 8 -> 7 -> 1 -> 4 -> 6. Thus the last survivor is 3, so 8 belongs to this sequence. (End)
