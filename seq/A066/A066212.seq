%N A066212 A measure of how close the golden ratio is to rational numbers.
%C A066212 New peaks (in absolute terms) occur when n is a Fibonacci number (1,2,3,5,8,13,21, ... A000045) and take alternate Fibonacci values with alternating signs (-3, 8, -21, 55, -144, 377, -987, ... A001906). Each new peak (after the second) appears twice (with different signs) between the next two peaks, when n is twice a Fibonacci number (4, 6, 10, 16, 26, ... and when n is a Lucas number (4, 7, 11, 18, 29, ... A000204); the larger peaks appear many more times later in the sequence.

%F A066212 a(n) = round(1/(phi-round(phi*n)/n)) where phi = (sqrt(5)+1)/2 = 1.6180339... = round(1/(phi-A007067(n)/n)).
%e A066212 a(5) = round(1/(1.6180339... - round(1.6180339...*5)/5)) = round(1/(1.6180339... - 8/5)) = round(55.45...) = 55, i.e., 8/5 is the closest multiple of 1/5 to phi and phi-8/5 is about 1/55.
