%C A066400 Indices of records are 1, 2, 8, 14, 52, 99, 589, 594, 595... (A277649) - _Peter Kagey_, Oct 24 2016
%C A066400 It is conjectured that 2 never appears in this sequence. a(n) = 2 if and only if A006255(n) = A072905(n). - _Peter Kagey_, Oct 25 2016
%C A066400 a(n) is three most of the time, then 5, then 6, then 4 for the first 1000 and the first 10000 terms. At n = 72, 78 and 85, a(n) is 4 or 5 and 4 and 5 occurred equally often so far. At 299, 301, 312, 322 and 403, a(n) is 4 or 6 and 4 and 6 occurred equally often so far. This doesn't happen for the first 10000 terms for 5 and 6. - _David A. Corneth_, Oct 25 2016
