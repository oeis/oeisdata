%N A066239 The floor(1.001*x)-perfect numbers, where f-perfect numbers for an arithmetical function f are defined in A066218.
%C A066239 The floor(n)-perfect numbers are the ordinary perfect numbers. The first three floor[1.001x]-perfect numbers are also ordinary perfect numbers and the first discrepancy comes at the fourth term, 32445 (the fourth perfect number is 8128). Consider other coefficients > 1 but < 1.001. There is some kind of continuity working here. The first discrepancies, if they exist, come at later and later terms as these coefficients are made closer to 1.
%C A066239 1845991216, 9210347984, 2907530334704, 140737345748992, and 2361183240850707054592 are terms. - _Alexander Violette_, Jan 28 2026

%e A066239 Let f(n) = floor(1.001*n). Then f(6) = 6 = 3+2+1 = f(3)+f(2)+f(1); so 6 is a term of the sequence.
