%N A066385 Smallest maximum of sum of 3 consecutive terms in any arrangement of [1..n] in a circle.
%C A066385 In a problem in the "Bundeswettbewerb 2002" competition there are 12 sticks of lengths 1,...,12 placed in a circle in random order. It has to be proved that there are at least 3 consecutive sticks with total length not less than 20. A closer look shows that the total length is at least a(12)=21. The problem of the contest is a consequence of the following observation: every term a(n) is at least ceiling(3*(n+1)/2), since n*a(n) >= Sum_{i=1..n} (p(i-1)+p(i)+p(i+1)) = 3*Sum_{i=1..n} i = 3*n*(n+1)/2. So in the case n=12 we have (total length) >= a(12)=21 >= 20.

%C A066385 Observations:
%C A066385 1. If we define f(n) = ceiling((3/2)*n) + 3, then a(n) = f(n) for all n < 39 except 3, 5, 6, 9, and 15.
%C A066385 2. a(n) = f(n) for all even n > 6.
%C A066385 3. f(n)-1 <= a(n) <= f(n) for all odd n > 3.
%C A066385 Conjecture: for all odd n > 15, a(n) = f(n). (End)
%C A066385 From _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Jul 07 2019: (Start)
%C A066385 If f(n) is defined as above, then for all n >= 3, the following steps generate a permutation p of 1..n such that the maximum of the consecutive triple sums does not exceed f(n):
%C A066385 If n mod 9 = 0 then let t = n/3 and u = n/9; for each k in 1..n,
%C A066385     p(k) = ceiling(n - (t + 1/2)*r - (3/2)*s) if s < 2*u,
%C A066385            1 + 3*s - (t-1)*r otherwise,
%C A066385     where r = k mod 3
%C A066385       and s = (floor(k/3) - 2*r*u) mod t.
%C A066385 If n mod 9 = 3 or 6 then let t = n/3; for each k in 1..n,
%C A066385     p(k) = ceiling(n - t*r - (3/2)*s) if s < 2*t/3,
%C A066385            1 + 3*s - t*r otherwise,
%C A066385     where r = k mod 3
%C A066385       and s = (floor(k/3) - ((t*(t mod 3) - 1)*r)/3) mod t.
%C A066385 If n mod 3 != 0 then for each k in 1..n,
%C A066385     p(k) = k+1 if k == n+1 (mod 3),
%C A066385            ceiling((n*(((k mod 3) mod 2) + 1) - k) / 2) otherwise.
%C A066385 (The maximum of the resulting consecutive triple sums is equal to f(n) for all n >= 3 except at n = 3, 6, 9, and 15; at those values of n, that maximum is less than f.)
%C A066385 It is not difficult to prove that, for even values of n > 6, a(n) >= (3/2)*n + 3; that lower bound, together with the upper bound provided by the steps above, demonstrates that a(n) = (3/2)*n + 3 for all even n > 6.
%C A066385 It seems to me that there should be a way to prove that, for all odd values of n > 15, a(n) must exceed (3/2)*n + 5/2. If such a proof were found, then it, together with the upper bound provided by the steps above, would demonstrate that a(n) = (3/2)*n + 7/2 for all odd n > 15, and thus a(n) = f(n) = ceiling((3/2)*n) + 3 for all n > 15.

%F A066385 Let p be a permutation of 1..n and let g(p) be the maximum of the consecutive triple sums p(i-1)+p(i)+p(i+1), where p(0)=p(n) and p(n+1)=p(1). a(n) is the minimum of all the g(p) taken over all permutations p.

%F A066385 a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-2) - a(n-3) for n > 18.

%e A066385 a(6)=11 because the cycle 1-4-5-2-3-6- has sums 11,10,11,10,11,10 with max=11, and there is no cycle that yields a smaller maximum.
%e A066385 This example by Helmut Richter shows that a(14) = 24 is very likely: p = (1-8-11-4-9-10-2-12-5-6-13-3-7-14-) with g(p) = 11+4+9 = 24 as maximal three-sum.
