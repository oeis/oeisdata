%N A066730 Numbers with ever-increasing minimal-square-deniers.
%C A066730 The Jacobi of modular reductions of a number is often used by a bignum library to give a quick (negative) answer to the question of whether an integer is an exact square. This sequence gives the cutoffs for ever-increasing numbers of required modular tests, on the assumption that one is avoiding a brute force square-root/square/compare. All terms to 8794864 found by Jack Brennen.

%e A066730 2 is 'square-denied' by 3, as 2 is not a quadratic residue mod 3 3 is square-denied by 2^2=4, but not by any lower prime power (2 or 3) 12 has 5 as its minimal square-denier (0 mod 2, 0 mod 3, 0 mod 4 all QRs) 21 has 2^3=8 as its minimal square-denier. (note that 24 has 7 as its minimal square-denier, the first number with that property, but it is larger than 21)
