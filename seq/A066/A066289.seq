%N A066289 Numbers k such that k divides DivisorSigma(2*j-1, k) for all j; i.e., all odd-power-sums of divisors of k are divisible by k.
%C A066289 Tested for each k and j < 200. Otherwise the proof for all j seems laborious, since the number of divisors of terms of sequence rapidly increases: {1, 4, 16, 24, 96, 96, 2304, ...}.
%C A066289 Tested for each k and j <= 1000. - _Thomas Baruchel_, Oct 10 2003
%C A066289 The given terms have been tested for all j. - _Don Reble_, Nov 03 2003
%C A066289 This is a proper subset of the multiply perfect numbers A007691. E.g., 8128 from A007691 is not here because its remainder at Sigma[odd,8128]/8128 division is 0 or 896 depending on odd exponent.
%F A066289 DivisorSigma(2*j-1, k)/k is an integer for all j = 1, 2, 3, ..., 200, ...
%Y A066289 Cf. A066135, A066284, A007691, A066290.

%E A066289 The following numbers belong to the sequence, but there may be missing terms in between: 796928461056000 (also belongs to A046060); 212517062615531520 (also belongs to A046060); 680489641226538823680000 (also belongs to A046061); 13297004660164711617331200000 (also belongs to A046061). - _Thomas Baruchel_, Oct 10 2003
%E A066289 Extended to 13 confirmed terms by _Don Reble_, Nov 04 2003. There is a question whether there are other members below a(13). However, there are none in Achim's list of multiperfect numbers (see A007691); Richard C. Schroeppel has suggested that that list is complete to 10^70 - if so, a(1..12) are correct; as for a(13), Rich says there's only "an epsilon chance that some undiscovered MPFN lies in the gap." So it is very likely to be correct. - Don Reble
