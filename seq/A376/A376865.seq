%N A376865 a(1) = 1. Thereafter, if A007947(a(n-1)) is in A002110, a(n) = smallest prime not already a term (condition [A]). Otherwise, if q is the greatest prime < Gpf(a(n-1)) which does not divide a(n-1), a(n) is the least novel multiple of q,(condition [B]).
%C A376865 A sequence with 3 distinct phases, similar to A372368.
%C A376865 Define cycle c(i) to be a run of consecutive terms beginning with a prime a(n) = prime(i) resulting from condition [A], which ends when a(n) is a term in A055932.
%C A376865 Phase I consists of consecutive closed cycles c(i) that start with a(n) = prime(i) via condition [A] and end with a term in A055932. As n increases through cycle c(i), G = gpf(a(n)) strictly decreases, and g = gpf(m(q)) is small compared to G. This phase ends at n = 4318.
%C A376865 Phase II consists of closed cycles c(i) that start with a(n) = prime(j), j > i, via condition [A] and end with a term in A055932. As n increases through cycle c(i), at times, g > G and we have a rejuvenated cycle. We may see multiple condition [B] primes, as well as runs of composite a(n) for n = 99528..155219 and n = 222811..262605. The humps in scatterplot are associated with these particular runs of composite terms. Rejuvenation of a cycle has G increment m(q) each time. A "ridge" of high m(q) values builds and grows increasingly difficult to traverse to reach G = 11, where we might have a number in A055932 and close the cycle. This phase likely ends with n = 2048704.
%C A376865 Phase III consists of condition [A] prime a(2048704) = prime(742) = 5647 and terms that follow, starting cycle c(135). As n increases, there are repeated rejuvenations and regular entry of primes through condition [B]. The repeated rejuvenations increase and expand a bank of high values of m(q) across many primes q only a few dozen iterations after new primes appear. New primes mean that prime(i) increases while in order to find a(n) in A055932, we need numbers with G = 11. Therefore, the circumstance that needs to arise to close the cycle becomes harder to achieve as n increases.
%C A376865 It is unlikely that this sequence is a permutation of natural numbers.

%e A376865 a(1) = 1 = A002110(0), so a(2) = 2 (smallest prime not already a term).
%e A376865 a(2) = 2 = A002110(1), so a(3) = 3.
%e A376865 a(3) = 3 not in A002110 therefore a(4) = 4, the least novel multiple of 2.
%e A376865 rad(4) = 2 so a(5) = 5 the smallest prime not already a term.
