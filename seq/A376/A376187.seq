%N A376187 For a line L in the plane, let C(L) denote the number of prime points [k, prime(k)] on L, and let M(L) denote the maximum prime(k) for any of these points; a(n) = minimum M(L) over all lines with C(L) = n, or -1 if there is no such line.
%C A376187 C(L) is the total number of prime points on L, by definition.
%C A376187 This sequence minimizes the largest prime in any line containing n prime-points. For the maximal smallest prime in any line that has the minimal largest prime (i.e. the lines arising in the present sequence), see A376190.
%C A376187 If C(L) = n in the definition is changed to C(L) >= n we get A376188.

%e A376187 There are two parallel lines of slope 6 which both contain 20 points. The first contains the points with [x,y] coordinates [45, 197], [51, 233], [52, 239], [54, 251], [55, 257], [56, 263], [57, 269], [64, 311], [71, 353], [72, 359], [76, 383], [77, 389], [79, 401], [86, 443], [87, 449], [89, 461], [92, 479], [94, 491], [96, 503], [97, 509] (here y == -1 mod 6),
%e A376187 and the second contains the points [42, 181], [44, 193], [47, 211], [50, 229], [63, 307], [67, 331], [68,337], [70, 349], [73, 367], [74, 373], [75, 379], [78, 397], [80, 409],[82, 421], [84, 433], [85, 439], [88, 457], [93, 487], [95, 499], [99, 523] (here y == 1 mod 6).
%e A376187 The existence of these two lines was confirmed by _W. Edwin Clark_, who produced the illustration in the LINKS section. This shows an enlargement of the region 35 <= x <= 105. The blue dots are the points on the first line, the red dots those on the second line.
%e A376187 It is interesting to contrast these two 20-point lines with the results in A005115, which gives the earliest arithmetic progressions of primes with a given number of terms. To find an arithmetic progression of 20 primes one has to go out to 572945039351. Of course these primes don't lie on a line, because of the irregular spacing between the primes.
%e A376187 For many further examples of lines containing many prime-points see the Table in the LINKS section.
%e A376187 There are at least five lines of 54 points each and slope 12; and at least 56 lines of 18 points each and slope 12.  There is a 79-point line, connecting (12125,129533)-(17484,193841), again with slope 12. Populous slope-12 lines are common within my search range. - _Don Reble_, Oct 02 2024.
