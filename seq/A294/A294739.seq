%N A294739 Numbers that are the sum of 5 nonzero squares in exactly 5 ways.
%C A294739 Theorem: There are no further terms. Proof (from a proof by _David A. Corneth_ on Nov 08 2017 in A294736): The von Eitzen link states that if n > 5408 then the number of ways to write n as a sum of 5 squares is at least floor(sqrt(n - 101) / 8) = 9. For n <= 5408, terms have been verified by inspection. Hence this sequence is finite and complete.
