%e A294905 For n=25, its proper divisors are 1 and 5, in binary "1" and "101", so the total number of 1's in them is 3, while 25 in binary is "11001", with binary weight 3, thus as A292257(25) <= A000120(25), a(25) = 1.
%e A294905 For n=55, its proper divisors are 1, 5 and 11, in binary "1", "101" and "1011", so the total number of 1's in them is 6, while 55 in binary is "110111", with binary weight 5, thus as A292257(55) > A000120(55), a(55) = 0.
