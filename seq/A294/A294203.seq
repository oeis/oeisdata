%C A294203 From _Michel Dekking_, Dec 30 2017: (Start)
%C A294203 Proof of the 'positions of 0' conjecture: let (z(n))=1,2,5,6,8,9,12,... be the positions of 0. The crucial observation is that if a number n is the sum of distinct Lucas parts greater than 1, then n+1 is a sum of Lucas parts. This implies that (z(2n))=2,6,9,13,... is the sequence of numbers A054770 that are not a sum of Lucas numbers. We see there that Ian Agol proved that b(n):=A054770(n)=floor(phi*n)+2n-1. But then the sequence of first differences (b(n+1)-b(n)) equals the Fibonacci word on the alphabet {4,3}, yielding that (z(2n)-z(2n-1)) equals the Fibonacci word on {3,2}, and we already know that z(2n+1)-z(2n)=1 for all n. On the other hand, A287775 has the same first difference sequence given by A108103. Since A287775(1)=2, the conjecture follows. (End)
%C A294203 Positions of 1: 0, 3, 4, 10, 15, 28, 44, 75, ... = A001350(n+1) - 1 (conjecture).
