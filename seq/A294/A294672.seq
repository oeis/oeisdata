%N A294672 Number of disjoint covering systems of cardinality n, up to equivalence under shift.
%C A294672 A disjoint covering system is a system of n congruences x == a_i (mod m_i) such that every integer is a solution to exactly one of the congruences. This sequence counts them up to "shift"; that is, two systems are the same if we can turn one into another by subtracting a constant from x.

%e A294672 For n = 3 there are three disjoint covering systems:
%e A294672 (a) x == 0 (mod 3), x == 1 (mod 3), x == 2 (mod 3)
%e A294672 (b) x == 0 (mod 2), x == 1 (mod 4), x == 3 (mod 4)
%e A294672 (c) x == 1 (mod 2), x == 0 (mod 4), x == 2 (mod 4)
%e A294672 but (b) and (c) are equivalent under shift.
