%N A294666 Decimal expansion of the hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen in Hertz.
%C A294666 The value is most often quoted as 1420405751.768 +- 0.02. Is it certain that the second digit after the decimal point is a 6? (Astonishingly enough, the most precise measurement seems to date back to 1970... Is it even sure that they used the relatively new definition of the second (from 1967) and that the later redefinition of the speed of light (resp. meter), needed to convert wavelengths to frequency, has no influence on the last digits?) - _M.

%F A294666 Equals E * A081823 / A003676, where E is the energy (in eV) emitted after spin-flip transition of atomic hydrogen in its ground electronic state, and A081823 and A003676 are the elementary charge e = 1.602176634*10^-19 C and Planck's constant h = 6.62607015*10^-34 Js, both exact values by definition of the SI system.
%e A294666 1420405751.7667 +- 0.0009 Hz.
%Y A294666 Cf. A003676 (Planck's constant h), A081823 (elementary charge e).
