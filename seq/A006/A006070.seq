%N A006070 Number of Hamiltonian paths on n-cube which are strictly not cycles.
%C A006070 Number of Gray codes of length n which strictly do not close.
%C A006070 More precisely, this is the number of ways of making a list of the 2^n nodes of the n-cube, with a distinguished starting position and a direction, such that each node is adjacent to the previous one and the last node is not adjacent to the first.

%e A006070 There are no such paths for n=1 or n=2 (the square). For n = 3 every path has to end at the node of the cube that is diametrically opposite to the start. There are 16 choices for the start and for each start there are 3 Hamiltonian paths that end at the opposite node, so a(3) = 3*16 = 48.
