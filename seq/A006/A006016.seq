%N A006016 The nim value for the game of Sym with n tails and 1 head.
%C A006016 Consider a row of n coins. In the game of Sym players take turns at turning over any symmetric arrangement of coins with the restriction that the rightmost coin turned over must be heads. The winner is the last player to move. This sequence gives the nim value for an initial arrangement consisting of n tails followed by 1 head, thus a(0)=1 is for a single coin starting on heads. In fact, with this starting arrangement the first player can always win by simply turning over the single head. Some nim values for small n are T=0, H=1, TH=2, HH=3, TTH=4, THH=6, HTH=5, HHH=7, TTTH=3, and so on. - _Sean A. Irvine_, Dec 05 2016
