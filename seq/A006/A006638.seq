%N A006638 Restricted postage stamp problem with n denominations and 2 stamps.
%C A006638 a(n) = largest span (range) attained by a restricted additive 2-basis of length n; an additive 2-basis is restricted if its span is exactly twice its largest element. - _Jukka Kohonen_, Apr 23 2014

%e A006638 a(10)=44: For example, the basis {0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 11, 15, 17, 20, 21, 22} has 10 nonzero elements, and all integers between 0 and 44 can be expressed as sums of two elements of the basis. Currently n=10 is the only known case where A006638 differs from A001212. - _Jukka Kohonen_, Apr 23 2014
