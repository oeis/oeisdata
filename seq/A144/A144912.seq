%N A144912 Unreduced numerators of digital mean, dm_num(b, n), with rows n in {2, 3, 4, ...} and columns b in {2, 3, 4, ..., n}.
%C A144912 The unreduced numerator of dm(b, n) is Sum_{i=1..d} (2*d_i - (b-1)), where d is the number of digits in the base b representation of n and d_i the individual digits. The corresponding denominator is 2 * d, giving a value in (-(b - 1) / 2, (b - 1) / 2] for n > 0.
%C A144912 dm_num(b, n) = d(b - 1) iff all the digits in n are b - 1.
%C A144912 dm_num(b, n) = -2(b - 2) for b = n, because n in base n is 10, giving dm_num(n, n) = 2 - n + 1 + 0 - n + 1 = 4 - 2 * n = -2(n - 2).
%C A144912 dm_num(b, n) = 0 for odd b and n having all digits equal to (b - 1) / 2, as well as for many other (b, n).
%C A144912 Defining m = ceiling((n + 1) / 2):
%C A144912 dm_num(b, n) = dm_num(b - 1, n) - 4 for b in [m + 1, n].
%C A144912 dm_num(m, n) = 0 for even n and 2 for odd n.
%C A144912 dm_num(m - 1, n) = 6 - n for even n > 4 and 9 - n for odd n > 5, producing a sequence of first differences {+2, -4, +2, -4, ...}.
%C A144912 Triangular patterns become clearly visible for large n, defined by additive periodicities along rational slopes. Zeros along the triangle borders correspond to ones in the Redheffer matrix until odd values become dominant. The line along m is the border between the two largest triangles. This pattern is masked by aliasing effects for small bases, notably including base 10, due to the thinness of the triangles which dominate at small b. Odd values may represent "artifacts" caused by "interference".
