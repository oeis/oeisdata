%N A144581 Triangular numbers k*(k+1)/2 such that (number of prime factors of k) + (number of prime factors of k+1) is composite.

%e A144581 7 has one prime factor and 8 = 2*2*2 has three prime factors; 1+3 = 4 is composite, hence 7*8/2 = 28 is in the sequence.
%e A144581 15 = 3*5 has two prime factors and 16=2*2*2*2 has four prime factors; 2+4 = 6 is composite, hence 15*16/2 = 120 is in the sequence.
%e A144581 18 = 2*3*3 has three prime factors and 19 has one prime factors; 3+1 = 4 is composite, hence 18*19/2 = 171 is in the sequence.
