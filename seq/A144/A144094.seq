%N A144094 Prime numbers r such that there is no pair of twin primes p,p+2 and q,q+2 such that p+q+2 = 6r.
%C A144094 Probably the sequence is complete.
%C A144094 More generally, {1, 2, 16, 66, 67, 86, 116, 131, 151, 186, 191, 211, 226, 541, 701} seem to be the only numbers such that {6n-2, 6n, 6n+2} do not have a Goldbach type of decomposition (sum of two primes) using only two pairs of twin primes. See also A266952, A266953, and A266948 and A007534. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jan 07 2016
%e A144094 6*3=18, 5,7 twin primes as 11,13, 5+13=7+11=18 so 3 not in the sequence 6*5=30, 11,13 twin primes as 17,19, 13+19=11+17=30 so 5 not in the sequence
