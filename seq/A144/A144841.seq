%C A144841 This was formerly conjectured to be "values of maximal number of regions obtained by joining each triple of n points on a 3-dimensional sphere (S_2) by a plane", a generalization of A000127.
%C A144841 However, my math friends in Japan were saying that there are 48 regions for n=5 and not 41:
%C A144841   (https://x.com/sugaku_day/status/1988617807647391992)
%C A144841   and so the comment is incorrect.
%C A144841 Indeed, I was able to visualize the counter-example, with (n=5 green points, and 48 regions with purple points inside). - See link.  (End)

%C A144841 The problem of partitioning a sphere by 3n planes determined by n points is discussed in a thread on Math StackExchange:

%C A144841 It appears quite plausible that the value f(5)=41 currently listed (e.g. in the OEIS entry for A144841) may indeed be too low. (End)
