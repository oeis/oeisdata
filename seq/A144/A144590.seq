%N A144590 Number of ordered ways of writing 2n+1 = i + j, where i is a prime and j is of the form k*(k+1), k > 0.
%C A144590 Based on a posting by _Zhi-Wei Sun_ to the Number Theory Mailing List, Mar 23 2008, where he conjectures that a(n) > 0 for n >= 2.
%C A144590 _Zhi-Wei Sun_ has offered a monetary reward for settling this conjecture.
%C A144590 No counterexample exists below 10^10 (_D. S. McNeil_).
