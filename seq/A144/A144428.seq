%N A144428 Square array read by ascending antidiagonals. A(L, n) is a table of sequences representing the number of valid nodes in level n of a labeled binary tree when the labeling rule forbids 1 of the 2^L states given by the last L digits of the parent label.
%C A144428 A complete labeled binary tree has the root as level 0, 2 nodes at level 1 (each labeled with one of the available symbols 1,2) and 2^n nodes at level n (each labeled with a unique n-digit sequence). The tree can be constructed by adopting a rule that at each successive level, each child node forms its label by adding one symbol to the parent's label.
%C A144428 An incomplete tree can be created by forbidding certain child nodes, using on a state-driven rule. If the state of a node is the last L digits of its label, there are 2^L possible states. Let a(L,n) be the single value denoting the number of valid nodes in level n after applying any given rule and A(L,n) is the sequence of values a(L,2), a(L,3), ..., a(L,n).
%C A144428 Assume this rule: for a given L, all of the 2^L states permit the usual dichotomous branching, except for one state which restricts the output to a single child node. The forbidden child of the pair has a label with the same last digit as the parent state.
%C A144428 This rule creates a set of sequences { A(L,n) } which are essentially the same as the standard "n-step Fibonacci" or "n-anacci" sequences. These can be displayed as the rows of a rectangular array in order of increasing L:

%C A144428 shows that the A(L,n) sequences differ only in the absence of the L+2 start-up values. This is an artifact of the construction method, since a(L,n) is undefined when labels are too short to contain a state sequence - i.e., for all nodes in levels < L.
%C A144428 This method of construction can be generalized (see link) which shows that the output from simple rule definitions is rich in well-known sequences.

%C A144428 The author of this array uses F(n) to denote the n-th term of the flattened table (for n >= 1). In addition, it seems that the author uses A(L,n) to denote the term in the L-th row and n-th column of the table. Clearly, L >= 2, but it is not clear whether n starts at 1 or at 2. Thus, in my comments and formulas below I use m to index the columns and start m at 1.
%C A144428 Let A(L, m) be the term in level (row) L and column m, where L >= 2 and m >= 1. Here L is the order of generalized Fibonacci sequence.
%C A144428 We have A(L, m) = 2^m for m = 1,...,L-1, and A(L, L) = 2^L - 1. Also,
%C A144428 A(L, m) = A(L, m-1) + A(L, m-2) + ... + A(L, m-L) for m >= L + 1.
%C A144428 Letting F(n) be the n-th term in the author's sequence (flattened table), we get F((k-1)*(k-2)/2 + i) = A(k-i+1, i) for k >= 2 and i = 1..k-1.

%F A144428 Let A(L, m) be the term in level (row) L and column m, where L >= 2 and m >= 1. Then A(L, m) = 2^m for m = 1,...,L-1; A(L, L) = 2^L - 1; and A(L, m) = S(L, m) - S(L, m-L) for m >= L + 1, where
