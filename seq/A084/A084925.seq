%N A084925 Inverse hyperbolic cotangent irreducible numbers: positive integers such that the arccoth of these numbers form a basis for the space of arccoth of rationals >=1. The hyperbolic analog of the Stormer numbers (A005528).
%C A084925 n is in the sequence if y = (xn+1)/(x+n) is noninteger for all integer x where 1 < x < n. Equivalently, n is in the sequence when n cannot be formed by (xy-1)/(x-y) for all integers x and y where x < n and 1 < y < x, so n cannot satisfy ((n+1)/(n-1))*((x+1)/(x-1)) = ((y+1)/(y-1)). Thus all the nearest neighbors of the primes (A045718) appear in this sequence.
