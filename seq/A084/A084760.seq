%N A084760 Squarefree numbers in ascending order such that the difference of successive terms is unique. a(m) - a(m-1) = a(k) - a(k-1) iff m = k.
%C A084760 The sequence of first differences is 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 19, ... Conjecture: (1) every number is a term of this sequence. For every number r there exists some k such that a(k) - a(k-1) = r. Question: What is the longest string of consecutive integers in this sequence (of successive differences)?
%C A084760 Answer: 5, as exemplified by the 6 values 17 to 57. Any longer series with differences consecutive integers must include a multiple of 4, as can be seen by enumerating all possibilities modulo 4. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Jul 14 2006
%e A084760 After 5 the next term is 10 and not 6 or 7, as 6-5 = 3-2 =1 and 7-5 = 5-3 = 2.
