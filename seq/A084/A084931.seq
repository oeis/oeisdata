%N A084931 Consider trajectory of n under repeated applications of the function f(x) = 'Sum of the prime factors of x (with multiplicity)' (see A029908). Sequence gives composite numbers n that end at a prime m that divides n and m is greater than any m's seen already.
%C A084931 With a prime triple (p,p+4,p+6), the number a(n) = 2*p*(p+6) is always in the sequence, f( f( 2*p*(p+6) )) = f( 2*(p+4) ) = p+6. Such prime triples can be found in sequence A022005.
%C A084931 As long as two successive triples (p1,p1 + 4,p1 + 6) and (p2,p2 + 4,p2 + 6) of A022005 have p2 < 1.2*p1, no other numbers occur in the sequence between a(n1) and a(n2), this holds at least for larger p1 > 500. Other types of prime sets occurring in the sequence: (p,p+4,3p-4) with F( F( (p+4)*(3p-4))) = F( 4p ) = p + 4 (p,p+6,p+8) with F( F( 4*p*(p+8) )) = F( 2*(p+6) ) = p + 8.
%C A084931 Large examples of (p,p+4,++6)-triples: (108748629354*4436*3251#*(4436*3251#+1)+210)*(4436*3251#-1)/35 + 7, + 11, + 13 (4135 digits, David Broadhurst) (18599651274*4436*3251#*(4436*3251#+1)+210)*(4436*3251#-1)/35 + 7, + 11, +13 (4134 digits, David Broadhurst) Record examples of prime triples can be found on Tony Forbes's web site. There are triples of type (p,p+4,p+6) too.
%e A084931 a(10) = 19982: f(f(19982)) = f(f(2*97*103)) = f(2+97+103) = f(202) = f(2*101) = 2+101 = 103.
