%N A084618 Maximum number of circles of area 1 that can be packed in a circle of area n.
%C A084618 For most values of n these are only conjectures, supported by numerical results.

%e A084618 a(4)=2 because a circle of area 4 is the smallest one covering two circles of area 1.
%e A084618 a(9)=7 is the arrangement of 6 circles closely packed around another circle. This arrangement fits into a circle that has 3*radius of smaller circles and thus 9*their area.
%Y A084618 Cf. A084616, A023393, A084644.
%Y A084618 Equivalent sequences for packing into a square: A337020, and equilateral triangle: A337019.
