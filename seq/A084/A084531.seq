%N A084531 Signature sequence of phi = (1+sqrt(5))/2 = 1.61803...
%C A084531 Arrange the numbers i+j*x (i,j >= 1) in increasing order; the sequence of i's is the signature of x; the sequence of j's is the signature of 1/x.
%C A084531 As a fractal sequence, if the first occurrence of each n is deleted, the remaining sequence is the original. That is, the upper trim of A084531 is A084531. Also, the lower trim of A084531 is A084531, meaning that if 1 is subtracted from every term and then all 0's are deleted, the result is the original sequence. Every fractal sequence begets an interspersion; the interspersion of A084531 is A167267. - _Clark Kimberling_, Oct 31 2009
