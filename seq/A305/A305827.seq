%N A305827 Beastly primes with beastly prime indices, i.e., primes p such that both the decimal representation of p and the decimal representation of the index of p in A000040 contain the substring "666".
%C A305827 Let p be a prime and let i be the index of p in A000040. Then p is a term of this sequence if both p and i are terms of A051003, or, equivalently, if i is a term of A051003 and p is a term of A131645.
%C A305827 Conjecture 1: The sequence is infinite.
%C A305827 An argument in favor of the conjecture goes as follows: Choose any sufficiently large integer i containing the substring "666". Then it seems very likely, assuming the digits of prime(i) are distributed uniformly, that prime(i) contains the substring "666" at least once.
%C A305827 Based on that argument, one can make the following stronger conjecture:
%C A305827 Conjecture 2: There exists an integer h such that for each i >= h, prime(A051003(i)) is a term of the sequence.
%C A305827 This conjecture may be false if some subsequences of the primes are infinite. For example, assume A004022 is infinite. Then it seems likely that there exists a large term of that sequence whose index in A000040 contains the substring "666".
%e A305827 836663 is prime(66651). Both the prime and its prime index contain the substring "666" in their decimal representation, so 836663 is a term of the sequence.
