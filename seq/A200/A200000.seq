%N A200000 Number of meanders filling out an n X n grid, reduced for symmetry.
%C A200000 The sequence counts the distinct closed paths that visit every cell of an n X n square lattice at least once, that never cross any edge between adjacent squares more than once, and that do not self-intersect. Paths related by rotation and/or reflection of the square lattice are not considered distinct.
%C A200000 Are a(1) and a(2) the only two terms equal to 1? And is a(3) the only term equal to 0? - _Daniel Forgues_, Nov 24 2011
%C A200000 The answer is yes: There are several patterns that can straightforwardly be generalized to any grid of any size n>3, e.g., #13 and #6347 of the graphics for a(6) (resp. #24 or #28 of a(5) for odd n). - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 24 2011

%e A200000 a(1) counts the paths that visit the single cell of the 1 X 1 lattice: there is one, the "fat dot".
