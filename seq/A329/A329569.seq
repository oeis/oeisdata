%N A329569 For all n >= 0, exactly 9 sums are prime among a(n+i) + a(n+j), 0 <= i < j < 6: lexicographically earliest such sequence of distinct nonnegative numbers.
%C A329569 That is, there are nine primes, counted with multiplicity, among the 15 pairwise sums of any six consecutive terms. This is the maximum: there can't be more than 9 primes among the pairwise sums of any 6 numbers > 1, cf. wiki page in LINKS.
%C A329569 Conjectured to be a permutation of the nonnegative integers. The restriction to [1,oo) is then a permutation of the positive integers with similar properties, but different from the lexico-smallest one, A329568 = (1, 2, 3, 9, 4, 10, 27, ...).
%C A329569 For n > 5, a(n) is the smallest number not used earlier such that the set a(n) + {a(n-5}, ..., a(n-1)} has the same number of primes as a(n-6) + {a(n-5), ..., a(n-1)}. Such a number always exists, by definition of the sequence. (If it would not exist for a given n, the term a(n-1) (or earlier) "is wrong and must be corrected", so to say.) See the wiki page for further considerations about existence and surjectivity.
%C A329569 For a(3) and a(4), one must exclude values 3 & 4 to be able to continue the sequence indefinitely, but in all other cases (at least for several hundred terms), the greedy choice gives the correct solution.
%C A329569 The values 3, 4 and 7 appear quite late at indices 25, 24 resp. 47.
