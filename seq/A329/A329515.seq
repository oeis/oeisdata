%N A329515 Array read by upward antidiagonals: row n = coordination sequence for cylinder formed by rolling up a strip of width 2*n+1 hexagons cut from the hexagonal grid by cuts perpendicular to grid lines.
%C A329515 The width of the strip is a little harder to define here. In the illustration for n=2, the strip is five hexagons wide if measured along hexagons that touch edge-to-edge. A path joining two vertices to be identified when the cylinder is formed has length 4n+2 edges (10 edges in the illustration for n=2).
%C A329515 Because the width 2*n+1 is odd, one edge of the cut has to be displaced sideways (by half the width of a hexagon) in order for the two edges to mesh properly.  The arrows in the figures indicate pairs of points which will coalesce.
%C A329515 For the case when the strip is 2*n hexagons wide see A329512.
%C A329515 For the case when the cuts are parallel to the grid lines, see A329508.
%C A329515 See A329501 and A329504 for coordination sequences for cylinders formed by rolling up the square grid.

%F A329515 The g.f.s for the rows could be found using the "trunks and branches" method (see Goodman-Strauss and Sloane), as was done in A329508. This step has not yet been carried out, so the following g.f. is at present only conjectural.
%F A329515 The g.f. G(n) for row n (n>=0) is (strongly) conjectured to be
%F A329515 (1/(1-x))*(1 + 2*x + 3*x^2*(1-x^(2*n-1))/(1-x) - (n-2)*x^(2*n+1) - n*x^(2*n+2)).
%F A329515 The values of G(0) through G(6) (certified by MAGMA) are:
%F A329515 (1 + x)/(1 - x),
%F A329515 (x^4 - x^3 - 3*x^2 - 2*x - 1)/(x - 1),
%F A329515 (2*x^6 - 3*x^4 - 3*x^3 - 3*x^2 - 2*x - 1)/(x - 1),
%F A329515 (3*x^8 + x^7 - 3*x^6 - 3*x^5 - 3*x^4 - 3*x^3 - 3*x^2 - 2*x - 1)/(x - 1),
%F A329515 (4*x^10 + 2*x^9 - 3*x^8 - 3*x^7 - 3*x^6 - 3*x^5 - 3*x^4 - 3*x^3 - 3*x^2 - 2*x - 1)/(x - 1),
%F A329515 (5*x^12 + 3*x^11 - 3*x^10 - 3*x^9 - 3*x^8 - 3*x^7 - 3*x^6 - 3*x^5 - 3*x^4 - 3*x^3 - 3*x^2 - 2*x - 1)/(x - 1),
%F A329515 (6*x^14 + 4*x^13 - 3*x^12 - 3*x^11 - 3*x^10 - 3*x^9 - 3*x^8 - 3*x^7 - 3*x^6 - 3*x^5 - 3*x^4 - 3*x^3 - 3*x^2 - 2*x - 1)/(x - 1).
%F A329515 Note that row n is equal to 4*n+2 once the (2*n+2)-nd term has been reached.
%F A329515 The g.f.s for the rows can also be obtained by regarding the 1-skeleton of the cylinder as the Cayley diagram for an appropriate group H, and computing the growth function for H (see the MAGMA code).
