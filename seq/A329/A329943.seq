%N A329943 Square array read by antidiagonals: T(n,k) is the number of right total relations between set A with n elements and set B with k elements.
%C A329943 A relation R between set A with n elements and set B with k elements is a subset of the Cartesian product A x B.  A relation R is right total if for each b in B there exists an a in A such that (a,b) in R.  T(n,k) is the number of right total relations and T(k,n) is the number of left total relations: relation R is left total if for each a in A there exists a b in B such that (a,b) in R.
