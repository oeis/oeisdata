%N A329241 Primes p such that Sum_{primes r <= q} Kronecker(r,p) <= 0 for all primes q <= p.
%C A329241 Primes p such that A329224(primepi(p)) > p (or equal to 0).
%C A329241 So, in terms of the above comparison, this sequence gives the primes p such that the smallest prime q to violate the inequality Sum_{primes r <= q} Kronecker(r,p) <= 0 is relatively large.
%C A329241 See also the comments and references in A329224, which is the main entry for this set of sequences.
%C A329241 There are 141 primes in this sequence below 10^5 and 548 primes below 10^6.
