%N A329872 Nontotients (A005277) that are the product of two totients (A002202).
%C A329872 We can have a list of nontotients and their factorizations into two totients. A totient m is in A301587 if and only if m never occurs in this list as a divisor of the nontotients. Using the list, many totients (10, 22, 44, 46, ...) are ruled out of A301587. But generally it's hard to prove that a number is in A301587.

%e A329872 484 is here, because 484 = 22*22, and 22 is a totient while 484 isn't. Similarly, if p == 3 (mod 4) is a prime such that (p-1)^2+1 is composite, then (p-1)^2 is here.
