%N A329950 Floor of area of quadrilateral with consecutive prime sides configured as a cyclic quadrilateral.
%C A329950 Because it is possible to generate triangles using three consecutive odd primes (see A096377) any four consecutive primes will form a quadrilateral. If such quadrilaterals are configured to be cyclic they will have maximal area. This sequence comprises the integer part of these maximal areas.
%C A329950 Proof: Given 4 consecutive odd primes a, b, c, d with a < b < c < d we only have to prove that a+b+c > d for a quadrilateral to exist. However we know that 3 consecutive odd primes will form a triangle hence a+b > c and a+b+c > 2c and by Bertrand's postulate there exists a prime d such that c < d < 2c so a+b+c > d. By induction this can be extended such that n consecutive primes will always form an n-gon.

%F A329950 The area K of a cyclic quadrilateral with sides a, b, c, d is given by Brahmagupta's formula K = sqrt((s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)) where s = (a+b+c+d)/2.
%e A329950 a(1)=13 because the area of the cyclic quadrilateral with sides 2,3,5,7 is (1/4)*sqrt((2+3+5-7)(2+3-5+7)(2-3+5+7)(-2+3+5+7)) = 13.699...
