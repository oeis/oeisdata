%N A329699 Number of excursions of length n with Motzkin-steps avoiding the consecutive steps UH, HU and HH.
%C A329699 The Motzkin step set is U=(1,1), H=(1,0) and D=(1,-1). An excursion is a path starting at (0,0), ending at (n,0) and never crossing the x-axis, i.e., staying at nonnegative altitude.
%C A329699 With a(1)=0, the number of Motzkin-like excursions of length n where the level step is H=(3,0). - _Alexander Burstein_, May 21 2025
%C A329699 In a (UH,HU,HH)-avoiding Motzkin path, an H step can only be preceded or followed by a D step. Therefore, when the path length n is not 1, each run of non-U steps can be partitioned into blocks of D or DH. Thus, each U step can be matched (via tunnels) with a unique block of D or DH. Define the following map recursively on (UH,HU,HH)-avoiding Motzkin paths other than H: an empty path is mapped to itself, and if P is mapped to P' and Q is mapped to Q', then UPDQ is mapped to UP'DQ', and UPDHQ is mapped to P'(HHH)Q', where (HHH) is a level step (3,0). This bijection maps (UH,HU,HH)-avoiding Motzkin paths of length n not equal 1 onto Motzkin-like paths of length n where the level step is (3,0). - _Alexander Burstein_, May 28 2025
