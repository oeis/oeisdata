%N A329512 Array read by upward antidiagonals: row n = coordination sequence for cylinder formed by rolling up a strip of width 2*n hexagons cut from the hexagonal grid by cuts perpendicular to grid lines.
%C A329512 The width of the strip is a little harder to define here. In the illustration for n=2, the strip is four hexagons wide if measured along hexagons that touch edge-to-edge. A path joining two vertices to be identified when the cylinder is formed has length 4n edges (8 edges in the illustration for n=2).
%C A329512 For the case when the strip is 2*n+1 hexagons wide see A329515.
%C A329512 For the case when the cuts are parallel to the grid lines, see A329508.
%C A329512 See A329501 and A329504 for coordination sequences for cylinders formed by rolling up the square grid.

%F A329512 The g.f.s for the rows could be found using the "trunks and branches" method (see Goodman-Strauss and Sloane), as was done in A329508. This step has not yet been carried out, so the following g.f. is at present only conjectural.
%F A329512 The g.f. G(n) for row n (n>=1) is (strongly) conjectured to be
%F A329512 (1/(1-x))*(1 + 2*x + 3*x^2*(1-x^(2*n-2))/(1-x) - (n-2)*x^(2*n) - (n-1)*x^(2*n+1)).
%F A329512 The values of G(1) through G(6) (certified by MAGMA) are:
%F A329512 (1+x)^2/(1-x),
%F A329512 (x^3-2*x^2-1)*(1+x)^2/(x-1),
%F A329512 (2*x^5-3*x^4+x^3-2*x^2-1)*(1+x)^2/(x-1),
%F A329512 (3*x^7-4*x^6+2*x^5-3*x^4+x^3-2*x^2-1)*(1+x)^2/(x-1),
%F A329512 (4*x^9-5*x^8+3*x^7-4*x^6+2*x^5-3*x^4+x^3-2*x^2-1)*(1+x)^2/(x-1),
%F A329512 (5*x^11-6*x^10+4*x^9-5*x^8+3*x^7-4*x^6+2*x^5-3*x^4+x^3-2*x^2-1)*(1+x)^2/(x-1).
%F A329512 Note that row n is equal to 4*n once the (2*n+1)-st term has been reached.
%F A329512 The g.f.s for the rows can also be obtained by regarding the 1-skeleton of the cylinder as the Cayley diagram for an appropriate group H, and computing the growth function for H (see the MAGMA code).
