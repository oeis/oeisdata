%C A096100 So far, up through a(13), the sequence is nondecreasing. I don't know a good reason why it should stay that way. (But since candidates for each successive value get rarer, the least candidate will tend to increase.) - _Don Reble_, Nov 22 2015
%C A096100 I don't think it will be easy to prove that this sequence is nondecreasing. The analogous sequence with other starting values often leads to non-monotonic sequences, e.g., (3, 2, 2, 3, 26, 876, 15136, ...), (4, 3, 6, 6, 5, 14, 3597, 1218704, ...), or (5, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1176, 40, 142863, ...). - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 24 2015
%e A096100 a(4) is not 2 since 2*2*2 + 1 = 9 is composite, but 2*3 + 1 = 7, 2*2*3 + 1 = 13, 1*2*2*3 + 1 = 13 are all prime, hence a(4) = 3.

Not efficient enough to go beyond a(8). - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 24 2015
