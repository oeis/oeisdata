%N A096828 Numbers that must appear in any variation of A097390.
%C A096828 These are also the numbers that must appear an infinite number of times in any A097390-like sequence (in English). For the numbers that can possibly appear infinitely often in such a sequence, see A096829.
%C A096828 Also, numbers that appear in A097395.
%e A096828 The number 1, not listed here, also appears in A097390, since the sentence on which A097390 is based ("This sentence contains the twentieth, eighth, ninth ... letters of the English alphabet, in order.") includes the word "contains," which includes "a," the first letter of the English alphabet. But this need not have been the case. Had the sentence begun: "This sentence is composed of ...", for example, 1 would not have been a member of the resulting sequence.
%Y A096828 Cf. A005224, A097389, A097390, A096829, A097395.
