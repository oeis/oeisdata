%N A096352 Triangle read by rows: each row represents all possible values for the size of the subset S{n - x} of {2^n...2^(n+1) - 1}, where S{n - x} represents all the members of that set with n - x factors.
%C A096352 The number of members in the n-th row appears to be equal to 2 + ( (n) * ((1 + sqrt(5))/2) ), or the n-th member of the lower Wythoff sequence (A000201) plus two. For the four rows show above, these values are 3, 5, 6, 8.
%C A096352 The first member of each row n is the number of primes in the set {2^n...2^(n + 1) - 1} (sequence A036378). The last member of each row follows sequence A092097, which is also equivalent to taking the difference of successive members of A052130 (the number of products of half-odd primes less than 2^n).
%e A096352 Let x = 1. In set {2^2..2^(3) - 1}, or {4, 5, 6, 7}, S{n - 1} = S{2 - 1} = S{1} = subset of all numbers with one factor (the primes). The size of this subset is 2, or {5, 7}. For the set {2^3...2^(4) - 1}, the size of subset S{3 - 1} is 4. For {2^4..2^(5) - 1}, the size of subset S{4 - 1} is 5. For all subsequent sets, the size of subset S{n - 1} will be 5.
