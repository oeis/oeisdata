%N A378174 Maximum number of clues in a n X n crossword puzzle where each word is at least 4 letters long and the puzzle has 180-degree rotational symmetry and no interlock.
%C A378174 Uses Basic American Crossword rules of: connectivity, 180-degree rotational symmetry.
%C A378174 Adds additional requirement of answer length at least 4.
%C A378174 a(1)-a(30) computed by using integer linear programming.
%C A378174 Because each row or column can have at most (n+1)/5 clues (consider appending a black square, and note that every clue requires 5 squares), we have a(n) <= 2n floor((n+1)/5).

%F A378174 Except for n = 9, 10, 12, and 14, conjectured recursive formula is a(n) = a(n-5) + 4(n-4).  In particular, conjectured explicit formula is a(n) = 2n floor((n+1)/5) if mod(n,5) = 3.
%e A378174 The trivial all-white puzzle is optimal for 4 <= n <= 8. A supporting file shows a(14)=64.
%e A378174 a(9) = 26 as shown by the following example:
