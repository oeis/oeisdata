%N A352288 Total cophenetic index of the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number n.
%C A352288 Mir, Rosselló, and Rotger, define the cophenetic value of a pair of childless vertices as the depth (distance down from the root) of their deepest common ancestor, and they then define the total cophenetic index of a tree as the sum of the cophenetic values over all such pairs.
%C A352288 a(n) = 0 iff n is in A325663, being rooted stars with any arm lengths, since the root (depth 0) is the common ancestor of every childless pair.
%C A352288 An identity relating the childless terminal Wiener index TW(n) = A348959(n) can be constructed by noting it measures distances from a pair of childless vertices to their common ancestor, and the cophenetic values measure from that ancestor up to the root.  So 2*a(n) + TW(n) is total depths Ext(n) = A196048(n) of the childless vertices, repeated by childless vertices C(n) = A109129(n) except itself, so that 2*a(n) + TW(n) = Ext(n)*(C(n) - 1)
