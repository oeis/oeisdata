%N A352748 Indices k of tribonacci numbers T(k) such that T(k+1) - (tribonacci constant)*T(k) is negative.
%C A352748 The tribonacci constant, which is approximately 1.839, is described in A058265. The tribonacci constant is the only real solution to the characteristic equation (x^3 = x^2+x+1) for the tribonacci sequence. It describes the asymptotic growth of the tribonacci sequence.
%C A352748 The sequence doesn't contain three consecutive numbers. Also, the difference between two consecutive numbers is never more than 3.

%F A352748 k+1 belongs to this sequence, for k>=2, if and only if (a+b*k) mod 2*Pi does not lie in (Pi/2, 3*Pi/2), where a = arg(c2*(psi-alpha)), b = arg(alpha), and T(n+1) = c1*psi^n + c2*alpha^n + c3*beta^n, where psi = 1.839... is the real zero of X^3-X^2-X-1 and alpha, beta are the complex zeros. - _Jeffrey Shallit_, Oct 07 2025
%e A352748 T(5) = 4 and T(6) = 7. Therefore, T(6) - (tribonacci constant)*T(5) equals approximately -0.357147 < 0. Thus, index 5 is in this sequence.
