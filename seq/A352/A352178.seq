%N A352178 Let S = {t_1, t_2, ..., t_n} be a set of n distinct integers and consider the sums t_i + t_j (i<j); a(n) is the maximum number of such sums that are powers of 2, over all choices for S.
%C A352178 Given distinct integers t_1, ..., t_n, form a graph G with n vertices labeled by the t_i, and with an edge from t_i to t_j, labeled t_i + t_j, whenever t_i + t_j is a power of 2.
%C A352178 See the Pratt link for the best lower bounds known, and examples of sets achieving these bounds, for 1 <= n <= 100. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Sep 26 2022
%C A352178 The following remarkable theorem is due to M. S. Smith (email of Mar 06 2022).
%C A352178 Theorem: G contains no 4-cycles.
%C A352178 Proof. Suppose the contrary, and assume the vertices t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4 form a 4-cycle, with edges labeled b_1 = t_1+t_2, b_2 = t_2+t_3, b_3 = t_3+t_4, b_4 = t_4+t_1. The b_i are powers of 2.
%C A352178 Since the t_i are distinct, b_1 != b_4, b_2 != b_1, b_3 != b_2, and b_4 != b_3.
%C A352178 We also have
%C A352178    (*) b_1+b_3 = b_2+b_4 = t_1+t_2+t_3+t_4.
%C A352178 However, the powers of 2 form a Sidon set (all pairwise sums are distinct), so (*) implies that either b_1=b_2 and b_3=b_4 or b_1=b_4 and b_3=b_2, both of which are impossible. QED
%C A352178 Let c(n) = A006855(n) denote the maximum number of edges in a graph on n nodes containing no 4-cycle.
%C A352178 Corollary: a(n) <= c(n).
%C A352178 The values of c(n) agree with the lower bounds on a(n) for n <= 9 (see A347301), which establishes the first 9 values of a(n).
%C A352178 Another corollary is that a(n) is bounded asymptotically by (n/4)*(sqrt(4n-3)+1) (see A006855).
%C A352178 The theorem is remarkable, since before the only known values of a(n) were the trivial values for n <= 3.
%C A352178 In summary, we have a(n) >= A347301(n) for n >= 6, and
%C A352178 a(n) <= A006855(n) for all n.
%C A352178 From _Thomas Scheuerle_, Sep 23 2022: (Start)
%C A352178 Subgraphs of G consisting only of edges between positive numbers are free from any cycles. Proof: If  b + c = 2^t then either (b-1)XOR(c) or (b)XOR(c-1) will be 2^t-1. The properties of XOR allow in this case only a chain for Sidon sets. (XOR means bitwise exclusive or).
%C A352178 From this we can conclude that all cycles in the graph G must contain at least one negative number.
%C A352178 Conjecture A: The count of negative numbers in an optimal solution is either equal to the count of positive numbers or one less.
%C A352178 This leads to Conjecture B: a(n) <= floor((n+1)*3/2). (End)
%C A352178 _Max Alekseyev_ points out that both conjectures are wrong.
%C A352178 (A)  Counterexamples are given by examples from A347301:
%C A352178   a(12) = 19: {  -9, -7, -5, -3, -1, 1, 3,  5,  7,  9, 11, 13 }
%C A352178   a(13) = 21: { -11, -7, -5, -3, -1, 1, 3,  5,  7,  9, 11, 13, 15 }
%C A352178 (B)  For n=14, this bound is 22, but it is smaller than a(14) = 24. _N. J. A. Sloane_, Sep 25 2022

%F A352178 a(n) <= (p-1) + (n-p)*k. k is the count of loose ends of the subgraphs of positive numbers. Subgraphs means here the biggest sets of positive numbers connected by sums which are equal to a power of two. There may be multiple such sets which are not interconnected directly. From observation it appears that a(n) <= (p-1) + (n-p)*(k-1) does hold in most cases. - _Thomas Scheuerle_, Sep 26 2022
