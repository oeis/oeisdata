%N A352127 a(n) is the smallest even number whose n smallest divisors > 2 are all odd.
%C A352127 For n > 1, if the set of divisors of an even number m begins with 1, 2, and n odd divisors, then m must be divisible by 2 but not by 4, and its smallest odd divisor > 1 must be a prime p such that m has at least n odd divisors in the interval [p, 2*p-1] (since 2*p will be an even divisor), all of which must be prime (since, if any were composite, then p would not be m's smallest divisor > 1). Thus, the smallest such m is twice the product of the first run of n consecutive primes, the largest and smallest of which have a ratio less than 2.
%F A352127 a(n) = 2*Product_{j=k+1..k+n} prime(j) where k is the smallest integer such that 2*prime(k+1) > prime(k+n).

%e A352127   a(2)  =                 30 = 2 *  3* 5
%e A352127   a(3)  =               2002 = 2 *  7*11*13
%e A352127   a(4)  =              92378 = 2 * 11*13*17*19
%e A352127   a(5)  =           13357342 = 2 * 17*19*23*29*31
%e A352127   a(6)  =         2697562774 = 2 * 23*29*31*37*41*43

%e A352127   a(10) = 406158566653369438 = 2 * 37*41*43*47*53*59*61*67*71*73
%e A352127   ...
%e A352127 a(n-1) divides a(n) whenever a(n-1) and a(n) have the same smallest odd prime factor; this happens at n = 2, 10, 12, 14, 19, 20, ..., which are the indices at which the largest prime factor of a(n) is less than twice the smallest prime factor of a(n-1). E.g., both a(9) and a(10) have 37 as their smallest odd prime factor, and 73 (the largest prime factor of a(10)) < 74 = 2*37.
