%N A352610 a(0) = 0; a(n+1) = Sum_{d a distinct decimal digit in a(n)} binomial(c(d)-1,2), where c(d) is the number of occurrences of d in a(j), 0 <= j <= n; see comments.
%C A352610 In other words, a(n+1) is the sum, taken over each distinct d in a(n), of the number of pairs (d,d) counted from different occurrences of d in a(j), 0 <= j <= n.
%C A352610 Every term is the sum of one or more triangular numbers (A000217). If no digit in a(n) has occurred before, a(n+1) = 0 (there are 7 such terms). Some numbers (0,1,3,4,6,10,...) occur multiple times, while others (2,5,8,11,...) never occur.
%C A352610 a(28844) = 2417583609 is the first pandigital term. Similar to A279818.

%e A352610 a(1) = 0 because there are no terms prior to a(0)=0;
%e A352610 a(2) = 1 because 0 has occurred just twice, and 0,0 can be counted just once.
%e A352610 To calculate a(39) given that a(38) = 133: c(1) = 14 so (1,1) can be counted 13*14/2=91 times, c(3) = 7 so (3,3) can be counted 6*7/2 = 21 times. Therefore a(39) = 91 + 21 = 112.
