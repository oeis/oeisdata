%C A352548 Gardner (1985) wrote: "A more astounding discovery is that: 22 pi^4 = 2143. A few multiplications, and the 10 million-plus decimals of pi have vanished. (Can this remarkable relationship mirror some as yet undiscovered facet of physical reality?)" In the Postscript to the 1999 reprint (cf. links) he writes "Divide (...) 2143 by 22 and hit the square-root button twice. You will get pi to eight decimals", and credits this discovery to Srinivasa Ramanujan. The MathOverflow page also mentions this and the near-integer 10*Pi^4 - 1/11 ≈ 974.0000012.
%C A352548 Even after a(0..4) = 0, the digits '0' and '1' remain significantly more frequent than other digits: almost 3 times more frequent than the digit 3 within the first 100 terms, and still 30 - 40 percent more frequent than half of the other digits among the first 1000 terms. However, we don't consider that to be a "secret hidden in pi".
