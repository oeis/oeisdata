%N A352272 Numbers whose squarefree part is congruent to 1 modulo 6.
%C A352272 Numbers of the form 4^i * 9^j * (6k+1), i, j, k >= 0.
%C A352272 Closed under multiplication.
%C A352272 The sequence forms a subgroup of the positive integers under the commutative operation A059897(.,.), one of 8 subgroups of the form {k : A007913(k) == 1 (mod m)} - in each case m is a divisor of 24. A059897 has a relevance to squarefree parts that arises from the identity A007913(k*n) = A059897(A007913(k), A007913(n)), where A007913(n) is the squarefree part of n.
%C A352272 The subgroup has 8 cosets, which partition the positive integers as follows. For each i in {1, 5}, j in {1, 2, 3, 6} there is a coset {m^2 * (6k+i) * j : m >= 1, k >= 0}. See the table in the examples.
%C A352272 None of the 8 cosets have been entered into the database previously, but many subgroups of the quotient group (which are formed of certain combinations of cosets) are represented among earlier OEIS sequences, including 6 of the 7 subgroups of index 2 (which combine 4 cosets). This sequence can therefore be defined as the intersection of pairs or triples of these sequences in many combinations (see the cross-references). See also the table in the example section of A352273 (the coset that includes 5).

%F A352272 {a(n) : n >= 1} = {m >= 1 : A007913(m) == 1 (mod 6)}.
%F A352272 {a(n) : n >= 1} = A334832 U A334832/7 U A334832/13 U A334832/19 where A334832/k denotes {A334832(m)/k : m >= 1, k divides A334832(m)}.
%F A352272 Using the same denotation, {a(n) : n >= 1} = A352273/5 = {A307151(A352273(m)) : m >= 1}.
%e A352272 The squarefree part of 9 is 1, which is congruent to 1 (mod 6), so 9 is in the sequence.
%e A352272 The squarefree part of 14 is 14, which is congruent to 2 (mod 6), so 14 is not in the sequence.
%e A352272 The squarefree part of 52 = 2^2 * 13 is 13, which is congruent to 1 (mod 6), so 52 is in the sequence.

%e A352272 The product of two positive integers is in this sequence if and only if they are in the same coset. The asymptotic density of cosets (containing) 1 and 5 is 1/4; of cosets 2 and 10 is 1/8; of cosets 3 and 15 is 1/12; of cosets 6 and 30 is 1/24.
