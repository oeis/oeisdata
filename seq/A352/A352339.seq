%N A352339 a(n) is the maximal (or lazy) Pell representation of n using a ternary system of vectors.
%C A352339 There are 2 well-established systems of giving every nonnegative integer a unique representation as a sum of positive Pell numbers (A000129), 1, 2, 5, 12, 29, 70, ...: the minimal (or greedy) representation (A317204) in which any occurrence of the digit 2 is succeeded by a 0 (i.e., if a Pell number appears twice in the sum, its preceding term in the Pell sequence does not appear), and the maximal (or lazy) representation of n in which any occurrence of the digit 0 is succeeded by a 2 (i.e., if a Pell number does not appear in the sum, its preceding term in the Pell sequence appears twice).

%e A352339 a(5) = 21 since 5 = 2*2 + 1.
%e A352339 a(6) = 22 since 6 = 2*2 + 2.
%e A352339 a(7) = 110 since 7 = 5 + 2.
%e A352339 We read the first term, 0, like the others, as a list of ternary digits. It has no 1s or 2s in it, so 0 here indicates a sum of 0 Pell numbers. This is called an "empty sum" (see Wiki link) and its total is 0. So 0 represents 0. - _Peter Munn_, Oct 04 2022
