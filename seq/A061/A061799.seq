%N A061799 Smallest number with at least n divisors.
%C A061799 Smallest number which can be expressed as the least common multiple of n distinct numbers. - _Amarnath Murthy_, Nov 27 2002
%C A061799 Also smallest possible member of a set of n+1 numbers with pairwise distinct GCD's. [Following an observation by _Charles R Greathouse IV_] (Proof: If the smallest number min(S) of the set (with card(S)=n+1) has a distinct GCD with each of the other n numbers, then it must have at least n distinct divisors (because any GCD is a divisor). It is then easy to choose larger members of the set so that all pairs of elements have pairwise distinct GCD's, e.g., by successively multiplying by distinct and sufficiently large primes.) - _M. F. Hasler_, Mar 05 2013

%e A061799 a(5)=12 since every number less than 12 has fewer than five divisors (1 has one; 2,3,5,7 and 11 have two each; 4 and 9 have three each; 6,8 and 10 have four each) while 12 has at least five (in fact it has six: 1,2,3,4,6 and 12).
