%N A061784 Number of sums prime(i) + prime(j) that occur more than once for 1 <= i <= j <= n, where prime(k) = k-th prime.
%e A061784 Let P(n) = {2, 3, .., p_n} be the set of the first n primes. Construct S(n) = {p+q : p,q in P}. If every sum p+q were distinct, then |S(n)| would be n*(n+1)/2 = A000217(n). But in reality, for n >= 4, certain sums occur more than once. a(n) is the count of repeated values. For example, P(6) = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13} yields S(6) = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26}, but 4 sums arise more than once: 10 = 3+7 = 5+5, 14 = 3+11 = 7+7, 16 = 3+13 = 5+11, 18 = 5+13 = 7+11. Thus, a(6) = 4 = A000217(n) - |S(6)|.
