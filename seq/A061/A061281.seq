%N A061281 Side of n-th equilateral triangle enclosing at least one point located at integer distances from the vertices.
%C A061281 The equation has many other integer solutions, such as {3,5,7,8}; most of these describe points that lie on the edge of the triangle. - _David Wasserman_, Jun 10 2002. See A089025.
