%N A061905 The iterative cycle: n -> sum of digits of n^2 has only two distinct elements.
%C A061905 It seems that {10,1}, {13,16} and {9,18} are the only iterative cycles with 2 distinct elements.
%e A061905 7 -> 4+9 = 13 -> 1+6+9 = 16 -> 2+5+6 = 13, thus only {13,16} are contained in the iterative cycle of 7. 24 -> 5+7+6 = 18 -> 3+2+4 = 9 -> 8+1 = 9, thus {18,9} are the only elements of the iterative cycle of 24.
