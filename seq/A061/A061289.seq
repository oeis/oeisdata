%N A061289 Consider a network of triangles consisting of an equilateral triangle divided into n^2 equilateral triangles plus a circle connecting the vertices of the main triangle. Sequence gives minimal number of corner turns required to trace the network in one continuous line.

%e A061289 a(1)=3 since you have to make two turns to trace the triangle and one to cover the circular part of the network.
%e A061289 From _Sean A. Irvine_, Feb 07 2023: (Start)
%e A061289 a(3)=10, there are 9 triangles:
%e A061289           A
%e A061289          / \
%e A061289         B---C
%e A061289        / \ / \
%e A061289       D---E---F
%e A061289      / \ / \ / \
%e A061289     G---H---I---J
%e A061289 Start on the circle (which passes through A, G, J, but is not shown in this picture), then trace the complete figure with A-J-G-B-I-F-D-H-C-B-A for a total of 10 turns. Note other paths achieving the same minimum number of turns are possible. (End)
