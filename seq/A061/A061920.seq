%N A061920 A list of equal temperaments (equal divisions of the octave) whose nearest scale steps are closer and closer approximations to the 7 pairs of complementary target ratios needed to express the 12 unsymmetrical steps of the untempered (Just Intonation) scale known as the Duodene: 3/2 and 4/3, 5/4 and 8/5, 6/5 and 5/3, 9/8 and 16/9, 10/9 and 9/5, 16/15 and 15/8 and 45/32 and 64/45.
%C A061920 The sequence was found by a computer search of all the equal divisions of the octave from 1 to 714321. The numerical value of each term represents a musical scale based on an equal division of the octave. The term 12, for example, signifies the scale which is formed by dividing the octave into 12 equal parts.
%F A061920 Recurrence Rule: The next term equals the current term plus one or more previous terms: a(n+1) = a(n) + a(n-x)... + a(n-y)... + a(n-z), etc.
%e A061920 118 = 53 + [34 + 31]; Again, 69413 = 57137 + [4296 + 3684 + 2513 + 1783].
