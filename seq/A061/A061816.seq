%N A061816 Obtain m by omitting trailing zeros from n (cf. A004151); a(n) = smallest multiple k*m which is a palindrome.
%C A061816 Every positive integer is a factor of a palindrome, unless it is a multiple of 10 (D. G. Radcliffe, see links).
%C A061816 Every integer n has a multiple of the form 99...9900...00. To see that n has a multiple that's a palindrome (allowing 0's on the left) with even digits, let 9n divide 99...9900...00; then n divides 22...2200...00. - _Dean Hickerson_, Jun 29 2001
%H A061816 P. De Geest, <a href="https://www.worldofnumbers.com/em36.htm">Smallest multipliers to make a number palindromic</a>.
%e A061816 For n = 30 we have m = 3, 1*m = 3 is a palindrome, so a(30) = 3. For n = m = 12 the smallest palindromic multiple is 21*m = 252, so a(12) = 252.
