%N A061790 Number of sums i^2 + j^2 that occur more than once for 1 <= i <= j <= n.
%C A061790 If the {s+t} sums are generated by addition 2 terms of an S set consisting of n different entries, then at least 1 and at most n(n+1)/2=A000217(n) distinct values can be obtained. The set of first n squares gives results falling between these two extremes.
%e A061790 S={1,4,9,...,100,121} provides 61 different sums of two (not necessarily different) squares: {2,5,8,..,202,221,242}. Only 5 of these sums arise more than once:
%e A061790    50 = 1 +  49 = 25 +  25;
%e A061790    65 = 1 +  64 = 16 +  49;
%e A061790    85 = 4 +  81 = 36 +  49;
%e A061790   125 = 4 + 121 = 25 + 100;
%e A061790   130 = 9 + 121 = 49 +  81.
%e A061790 Therefore a(11) = (12*11/2) - 61 = 5.
%t A061790 f[x_] := x^2 t0=Table[Length[Union[Flatten[Table[f[u]+f[w], {w, 1, m}, {u, 1, m}]]]], {m, 1, 75}] t1=Table[(w*(w+1)/2)-Part[t0, w], {w, a, b}]
