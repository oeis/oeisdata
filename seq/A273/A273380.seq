%N A273380 2..a(n) is the smallest range in which the most common value of omega(k) is n, where omega(k) is the number of prime divisors of k (A001221).
%e A273380 Among the numbers from 2 to a(2)=46 the most common value of omega is 2. Indeed, there are 21 numbers for which omega is 1 (primes or prime powers) and 22 for which omega is 2.
