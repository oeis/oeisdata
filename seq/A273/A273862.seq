%N A273862 The successive numbers of digits visible between two prime terms are given by the sequence itself.
%C A273862 The sequence starts with a(1)=0. It is then extended with the smallest integer not yet present and not leading to a contradiction.
%e A273862 The first two primes that appear in the sequence are 2 and 3; between 2 and 3 there are 0 digits and this 0 corresponds to the starting 0 of the sequence.
%e A273862 The next prime is 5 and between 3 and 5 there is 1 digit [which is 4] and this 1 corresponds to the next term of the sequence.
%e A273862 The next prime is 7 and between 5 and 7 there are 2 digits [which are 6 and 8] and this 2 corresponds to the next term of the sequence.
%e A273862 The next prime is 11 and between 7 and 11 there are 3 digits [which are 9, 1 and 0] and this 3 corresponds to the next term of the sequence.
%e A273862 The next prime is 13 and between 11 and 13 there are 4 digits [which are 1, 2, 1 and 4] and this 4 corresponds to the next term of the sequence.
%e A273862 The next prime is 17 and between 13 and 17 there are 5 digits [which are 1, 5, 1, 0 and 0] and this 5 corresponds to the next term of the sequence.
