%N A273468 Number of minimally rigid graphs with n vertices constructible by Henneberg type I moves.
%C A273468 A graph is called rigid if, when we fix the length of each edge, it has only finitely many embeddings in the plane. A graph is called minimally rigid (or a Laman graph) if there is no edge that can be omitted while keeping the rigidity property. Laman graphs can be constructed by applying successively Henneberg moves (of type I or type II), starting with the graph that consists of two vertices joined by an edge. Here we consider Laman graphs that can be obtained by using only Henneberg type I moves, which means: adding one vertex and joining it with two different existing vertices.
%C A273468 From _Allan Bickle_, Feb 03 2026: (Start)
%C A273468 This is the number of maximal 2-degenerate graphs with n vertices.  A maximal 2-degenerate graph can be constructed from a 2-clique by iteratively adding a new 2-leaf (vertex of degree 2) adjacent to two existing vertices.
%C A273468 Images of all the graphs for 5 and 6 vertices are in the Bickle 2024 survey.
%C A273468 Images and other parameters of these graphs up to 7 vertices can be found in House of Graphs. For 6 vertices, search Number of Vertices = 6, Number of Edges = 9, Degeneracy = 2. (End)

%e A273468 A single vertex is rigid.
%e A273468 The graph consisting of two vertices joined by an edge is rigid.
%e A273468 A triangle is rigid and it is obtained by a single Henneberg type I move.
%e A273468 One more such move yields the only Laman graph with four vertices.
%e A273468 Also all three Laman graphs with five vertices can be constructed with type I moves. Therefore the first five entries of this sequence agree with A227117.
%e A273468 An example of a Laman graph that cannot be constructed using only Henneberg type I moves is the complete bipartite graph K(3,3).
