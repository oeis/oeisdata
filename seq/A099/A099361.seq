%N A099361 A variation on the sieve of Eratosthenes (A000040): Start with the primes; the first term is 2, which is a(1) and we cross off every second prime starting with 2; the next prime not crossed off is 3, which is a(2) and we cross off every third prime starting with 3; the next prime not crossed off is 7, which is a(3) and we cross off every 7th prime starting with 7; and so on.
%C A099361 In contrast to Flavius's sieve (A000960), primes are not erased when they are crossed off; that is, primes get crossed off multiple times (see A099362).
