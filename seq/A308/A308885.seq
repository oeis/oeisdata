%N A308885 Positions of 0's on the spiral defined in A308884.
%C A308885 An equivalent definition: Walk along the square spiral, with its cells numbered starting at 0, as in A308884 and A274641. Start with no knights. If the square you are at is not attacked by an existing knight, place a knight there, otherwise leave it empty. The sequence lists the squares where the knights are. See link for an illustration. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Feb 05 2026

Sloane, <a href="/A308885/a308885.jpg">Illustration for the equivalent definition mentioned in the COMMENTS.</a> [Circles contain a knight, squares with a slash are attacked by a knight.] It would be interesting to see a larger portion of the spiral, and the patterns formed by the knights.
