%C A308885 An equivalent definition: Walk along the square spiral, with its cells numbered starting at 0, as in A308884 and A274641. Start with no knights. If the square you are at is not attacked by an existing knight, place a knight there, otherwise leave it empty. The sequence lists the squares where the knights are. See links for illustrations.
%C A308885 For the initial 26 or so layers of the spiral, Karlsson's illustration shows a regular structure. But other sequences of this type have been known to become chaotic after millions of terms. Could that happen here? (End)
