%C A308496 Floretions of all orders. - _Creighton Dement_, Oct 28 2022
%C A308496 For any natural number n, the set of terms of this sequence between indices (4^n-1)/3 and (4^(n+1)-4)/3 is "isomorphic" to the group of n-th order floretions. In this case, group multiplication is given by bitwise logical operations (see EXAMPLE). Note that the case of n = 1 is simply the quaternions.
%C A308496 In the table below, the left column is the binary representation, the middle column the terms of ((a(n)) and the right column the conventional notation. Multiply x*y (disregarding signs) using the bitwise XNOR operation, where x and y are any floretions of the same order. The XNOR operation returns a 1 if the number of 1's in its inputs is even, and a 0 if the number of 1's is odd. This operation is used to calculate the base vector of the result.

%C A308496 Note that for a floretion of order n, two digits from any one of its "binary triplets" _abc_ determine the other since XOR(a,b,c) = 1.
%C A308496 When working with a floretion algebra over the reals, i.e., elements of the form x = q_1*f_1 + ... q_m*f_m where q_1,...,q_m are real numbers and f_1,...,f_m are any floretions of the same order, then x may also be referred to as a "floretion". In this case f_1,...,f_m (i.e., terms of this sequence) may be referred to as "floretion base vectors" to avoid confusion.
%C A308496 Taking signs into account:
%C A308496 Given two binary representations (ab) and (cd) for quaternion elements, define multiplication as:
%C A308496     Compute (XNOR(a,c))(XNOR(b,d)) to get the base vector of the result.
%C A308496     Compute AND(b,c), AND(XNOR(a,b),d), and AND(a,XNOR(c,d)). These are all bitwise AND operations.
%C A308496     The sign is negative if and only if the total number of 1's in the results is even.
%C A308496 For example, with k*j = (10)*(01) = -i, compute:
%C A308496     The base vector as (XNOR(1,0) XNOR(0,1)) = (0)(0) = i.
%C A308496     The signs as AND(0,1), AND(XNOR(1,0),1), AND(1, XNOR(0,1)) = 0, 0, 0. There are zero 1's in total, which is an even number, so the result is negative.
%C A308496 An example of image processing: take for example a quaternion x = .2i + .5j + .3k + e. Assume we have a square monitor (aspect ratio). Furthermore, assume the screen is divided into 4 squares- one for i (bottom left), one for j (top left), one for k (top right) one for e (bottom right) and that the coefficient is the amount the pixels are lit up on the screen (1 being full brightness, 0 being off- this could be modified later to accommodate negative numbers).  Now imagine we have square monitor of resolution 2^n x 2^n. Then we can represent any black and white image with that resolution with an n-th order floretion. This means we can multiply images together, with some parallels to Fourier analysis.
%C A308496 Multiplying an image by an idempotent floretion would allow one to repeatedly apply a specific transformation (e.g., a rotation, scaling, or some other operation) to an image, and then undo all of those transformations by continuing to apply the same operation a certain number of times. It could be used in applications such as data encryption, where an image could be "scrambled" using a specific floretion and then "unscrambled" by continuing to apply the same floretion.
%C A308496 A compact definition of multiplication is x*y = (ab)(cd) = (-1)^{m+1} (aqc)(bqd) where m = b&c + (aqb)&d + a&(cqd) and "q", "&" are the bitwise XNOR and AND operators respectively. - _Creighton Dement_, Jul 09 2023
