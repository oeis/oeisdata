%N A308508 Numbers (including primorials) that satisfy "three rules that highly composite numbers must have" (see Comments below) but are not highly composite numbers.
%C A308508 The three rules that the highly composite numbers (and this sequence too) must have are:
%C A308508    - The primes in the product have to be consecutive and start with 2,
%C A308508    - The exponents of the primes must be decreasing,
%C A308508    - The final exponent of the primes must be 1 (except 4 = 2^2 and 36 = 2^2 * 3^2, but those are highly composite numbers and are excluded).
%C A308508 Except for numbers of the form 2^n * 3, the terms are divisible by 10, because a(n) has the form of 2^n * 3^m * 5^j * c = (2 * 5) * 2^(n - 1) * 3^m * 5^(j - 1) * c.
%C A308508 Except for terms that are primorials, all others are divisible by 12, because a(n) has the form 2^n * 3^m * c = (2^2 * 3) * 2^{n - 2} * 3^(m - 1) * c.
%C A308508 All terms are divisible by 6, because a(n) has the form 2^n * 3^m * c = (2 * 3) * 2^(n - 1) * 3^(m - 1) * c.
%C A308508 It seems that eulerphi(a(n)) is always divisible by 8.
