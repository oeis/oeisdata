%N A308539 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive terms such that for any n > 0, the initial digit of a(n) divides a(n+1).
%C A308539 This sequence is a permutation of the natural numbers (with inverse A308541):
%C A308539 - for any nonzero digit d, there are infinitely many multiples of d, hence we can always extend the sequence,
%C A308539 - by the pigeonhole principle, for some nonzero digit t, there are infinitely many terms with initial digit t,
%C A308539 - so eventually every multiple of t will appear in the sequence,
%C A308539 - after a term with initial digit 1, we can always extend the sequence with the least natural number not yet in the sequence,
%C A308539 - as there are infinitely many multiples of t with initial digit 1, so infinitely many terms with initial digit 1, every natural number will eventually appear, QED.
