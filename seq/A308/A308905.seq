%N A308905 Number of numbers k such that exactly half the numbers in [1..k] are prime(n)-smooth.
%C A308905 When a(n)=1, A290154(n) = A308904(n). Values of n at which this occurs begin 2, 3, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 16, 25, 27, 47, 56, 60, 64, 65, 75, 81, 99, ... Do they tend to occur less frequently as n increases?
%e A308905 For n=1: prime(1)=2, and the 2-smooth numbers are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ... (A000079, the powers of 2), so for k = 1..10, the number of 2-smooth numbers in the interval [1..k] increases as follows:

%e A308905 It is easy to show that, for all k > 8, fewer than half of the numbers in [1..k] are 2-smooth, so there are only 2 values of k, namely, k=6 and k=8, at which exactly half of the numbers in the interval [1..k] are 2-smooth numbers, so a(1)=2.
%e A308905 For n=2: prime(2)=3, and the 3-smooth numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 27, 32, ... (A003586). It can be shown that k=20 is the only number k such that exactly half of the numbers in the interval [1..k] are 3-smooth. Since there is only 1 such number k, a(2)=1.
