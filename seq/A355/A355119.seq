%N A355119 a(n) is the number of order-n magic triangles composed of the numbers from 1 to n(n+1)/2 in which the sum of the k-th row and the (n-k+1)-st row is same for all k and all three directions, counted up to rotations and reflections.
%C A355119 The magic sum is (n(n+1)/2 + 1)(n+1)/2.
%C A355119 For n >= 3, a(n) is a multiple of 6 because the rotation of only three corners does not affect the sum of the 1st row and n-th row.
%C A355119 This magic triangle is an analog of magic triangles from St. Olaf College, which are published in the Pi Mu Epsilon Journal (Fall 2021). Their magic triangles use square numbers of triangles.

%F A355119 a(n) = 0 if n is a multiple of 4. - _Stefano Spezia_, Jun 20 2022
%e A355119 a(1) and a(2) are trivially 1.
%e A355119 a(3) is trivially 0 because the sum of 2nd row cannot be same for each direction.
%e A355119 a(4k) for positive integers k is trivially 0 because the magic sums are not integers in this cases.
