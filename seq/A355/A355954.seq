%N A355954 Decimal expansion of the constant A in the asymptotic behavior R(d) = log(d)/(Pi*sqrt(3)) + A of the resistance between two nodes separated by the Euclidean distance d in an infinite triangular lattice of one-ohm resistors.
%C A355954 From an engineering point of view, this constant summand can be regarded as a kind of near-field contribution, which contains the well-known resistance of 1/3 ohms between 2 neighboring nodes as the main part.
%C A355954 The asymptotic formula is analogous to that known for the square lattice. The constant determined by comparison with the exact integral (see A355589) for the resistance, evaluated for very large distances d (maximum approx. 10^9, for larger arguments the computational effort is no longer manageable), agrees with the closed form given by Kenyon and Wilson.
