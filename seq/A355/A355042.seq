%N A355042 a(n) is the number of minimal balanced collections on a ground set of n labeled elements.
%C A355042 A balanced collection, a.k.a. a balanced set, is a collection of subsets of a ground set N together with a system of weights such that, for any element i of N, the sum of the weights associated with the subsets containing i is one. A minimal balanced collection is a minimal (w.r.t. inclusion) element among the balanced collections.
%C A355042 Number of hypergraphs of order n that admit a unique perfect fractional matching assigning a positive weight to each hyperedge.

%e A355042 The a(3) = 6 solutions are {{a}, {b}, {c}}, {{a}, {bc}}, {{b}, {ac}}, {{c}, {ab}}, {{abc}}, {{ab}, {bc}, {ac}}. The collection {{a}, {b}, {c}, {abc}} is not a solution because it is the union of two other solutions and is therefore not minimal.
%e A355042 From _Andrew Howroyd_, Jan 14 2023: (Start)
%e A355042 One solution for n = 4 is {{abc}, {ad}, {bd}, {cd}}. In this solution the set {abc} has weight 2/3 while the others have weight 1/3. This solution is shown in tabular form below:
%e A355042             a    b    c    d
%e A355042    {abc}   2/3  2/3  2/3   -
%e A355042    {ad}    1/3   -    -   1/3
%e A355042    {bd}     -   1/3   -   1/3
%e A355042    {cd}     -    -   1/3  1/3
%e A355042 In the table it can be seen that the values in each row are equal while those in each column sum to 1.
