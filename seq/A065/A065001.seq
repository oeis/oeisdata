%N A065001 a(n) = (presumed) number of palindromes in the 'Reverse and Add!' trajectory of n, or -1 if this number is not finite.
%C A065001 Presumably a(196) = 0 (see A016016). Conjecture: There is no n > 0 such that the trajectory of n contains an infinite number of palindromes; the trajectory of n eventually leads to a term in the trajectory of some integer k which belongs to sequence A063048, i.e. whose trajectory (presumably) never leads to a palindrome.

%e A065001 8, 77, 1111, 2222, 4444, 8888, 661166, 3654563 are the eight palindromes in the trajectory of 8 and 3654563 + 3654563 = 7309126 is the sixth term in the trajectory of 10577 (see A063433) which (presumably) never leads to a palindrome (see A063048), so a(8) = 8.
