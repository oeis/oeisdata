%N A065957 This is the case k = 3 of the number of orbits of the group of units of Z/(n) acting naturally on the k-subsets of Z/(n).
%e A065957 a(4) = 3 since when U(4) = {1,3} acts naturally on the three 3-subsets {0,1,2}, {0,1,3}, {0,2,3}, {1,2,3} of Z/(4) the orbits are {{0,1,2},{0,2,3}}, {{0,1,3}} and {{1,2,3}}. Note that 3{0,1,2} = {0,2,3}.
