%N A065828 Binary digits found in the decimal expansion of Pi, listed with repetitions and in order of appearance.
%C A065828 If Pi is normal then every possible string of 0's and 1's will appear in this sequence. - _Joshua Oliver_, Nov 27 2019
%C A065828 The condition of normality is much stronger than required for this result, which is already a consequence of the digit sequence being disjunctive. But even that is much stronger than required, because it would mean that any binary string appears as a substring in the (decimal!) digits of Pi, not just as a subsequence, which is all that is required for any binary string to appear here (where all digits > 1 are deleted), even infinitely often. - _M. F. Hasler_, Feb 04 2026
