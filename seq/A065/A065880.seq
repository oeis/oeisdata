%N A065880 Largest positive number that is n times the number of 1's in its binary expansion, or 0 if no such number exists.
%C A065880 a(n) is bounded above by n*A272756(n), so a program only has to check values up to that point to see if a(n) is zero. - _Peter Kagey_, May 05 2016

%e A065880 a(23)=115 since 115 is written in binary as 1110011 and 115/(1+1+1+0+0+1+1)=23 and there is no higher possibility (if k is more than 127 then k divided by its number of binary 1's is more than 26).
