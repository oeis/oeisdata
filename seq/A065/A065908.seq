%N A065908 Second solution mod p of x^4 = 2 for primes p such that only two solutions exist.
%C A065908 Conjecture: no integer occurs more than three times in this sequence. Confirmed for the first 2399 terms of A007522 (primes < 100000). In this section, there are no integers which do occur thrice.
%F A065908 a(n) = second (largest) solution mod p of x^4 = 2, where p is the n-th prime such that x^4 = 2 has only two solutions mod p, i.e. p is the n-th term of A007522.
%e A065908 a(3) = 16, since 31 is the third term of A007522 and 16 is the second solution mod 31 of x^4 = 2.
