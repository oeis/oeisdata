%N A065910 Second solution mod p of x^4 = 2 for primes p such that more than two solution exists.
%C A065910 Conjecture: no integer occurs more than three time in this sequence. Confirmed for the first 1182 terms of A014754 (primes < 100000). In this section, there are no integers which do occur thrice. Moreover, no integer is first, second, third or fourth solution for more than three primes. Confirmed for the first 2399 terms of A007522 and the first 1182 terms of A014754 (primes < 100000).
%F A065910 a(n) = second solution mod p of x^4 = 2, where p is the n-th prime such that x^4 = 2 has more than two solutions mod p, i.e. p is the n-th term of A014754.
%e A065910 a(3) = 47, since 113 is the third term of A014754, 27, 47, 66 and 86 are the solutions mod 113 of x^4 = 2 and 47 is the second one.
