%N A065810 Sorted positions of the elements of the quasicyclic group Z+(2a+1)/(2^b) [a > 0 and a < 2^(b-1), b > 0] at the ]0,1[ side of the Stern-Brocot Tree (A007305/A007306).
%C A065810 It is easily proved that in the denominators given by A007306, the even values occur only at every third position, but can one find a simple rule for these positions of the denominators which are the powers of 2 only?
%H A065810 <a href="/index/St#Stern">Index entries for sequences related to Stern's sequences</a>
%Y A065810 Permutation of A065674. Cf. A065811, A065812. Gives the positions of zeros in A065936.
