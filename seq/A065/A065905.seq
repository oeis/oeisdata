%N A065905 Integers i > 1 for which there are two primes p such that i is a solution mod p of x^4 = 2.
%C A065905 Solutions mod p are represented by integers from 0 to p-1. The following equivalences holds for i > 1: There is a prime p such that i is a solution mod p of x^4 = 2 iff i^4 - 2 has a prime factor > i; i is a solution mod p of x^4 = 2 iff p is a prime factor of i^4 - 2 and p > i. i^4 - 2 has at most three prime factors > i. For i such that i^4 - 2 has no resp. one resp. three prime factors > i cf. A065903 resp. A065904 resp. A065906.
%F A065905 a(n) = n-th integer i such that i^4 - 2 has two prime factors > i.
%e A065905 a(3) = 16, since 16 is (after 5 and 8) the third integer i for which there are two primes p > i (viz. 31 and 151) such that i is a solution mod p of x^4 = 2, or equivalently, 16^4 - 2 = 65534 = 2*7*31*151 has two prime factors > 4. (cf. A065902).
