%N A060122 Smallest solution mod p of x^3 = 2 for primes p such that more than one solution exists.
%C A060122 Solutions mod p are represented by integers from 0 to p-1. No integer occurs more than twice in this sequence (cf. comment to A060121). There are integers which do occur twice, e.g. 52, 57, 152 (cf. A060914). Moreover, no integer occurs more than twice in A060121, A060122, A060123 and A060124 taken together.
%F A060122 a(n) = first (least) solution mod p of x^3 = 2, where p is the n-th prime such that x^3 = 2 has more than one solution mod p, i.e. p is the n-th term of A014752.
%e A060122 a(3) = 57, since 109 is the third term of A014752, 57, 58 and 103 are the solutions mod 109 of x^3 = 2 and 57 is the least one.
%Y A060122 Cf. A040028, A014752, A059940, A060914, A060121, A060123, A060124.
