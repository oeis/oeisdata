%N A060592 Square table by antidiagonals of minimum number of moves between two positions in the Tower of Hanoi (with three pegs: 0,1,2), where with position n written in base 3, xyz means smallest disk is on peg z, second smallest is on peg y, third smallest on peg x, etc. and leading zeros indicate largest disks are all on peg 0.

%e A060592 T(4,9)=5 since 4 and 9 written in base 3 are 11 and 100, i.e. the starting position has the first and second disks on peg 1 and the others on peg 0, while the end position has the third disk on peg 1 and the others on peg 0; the five optimal moves between these positions are: move the third disk to peg 2, then the first to peg 2, the second to peg 0, the first to peg 0 and finally the third to peg 1.
