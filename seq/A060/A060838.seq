%N A060838 Rank of elliptic curve x^3 + y^3 = n.
%C A060838 The elliptic curve X^3 + Y^3 = D*Z^3 where D is a rational integer has a birationally equivalent form y^2*z = x^3 - 2^4*3^3*D^2*z^3 where x = 2^2*3*D*Z, y = 2^2*3^3*D*(Y - X), z = X + Y (see p. 123 of Stephens). Taking z = 1 and 2^2*3^3 = 432 yields y^2 = x^3 - 432*D^2, which is the Weierstrass form of the elliptic curve used by John Voight in the Magma program below. - _Ralf Steiner_, Nov 11 2017
%C A060838 Zagier and Kramarz studied the analytic rank of the curve E: x^3 + y^3 = m, where m is cubefree. They computed L(E,1) for 0 < m <= 70000 and also L'(E,1) if the sign of the functional equation for L(E,1) was negative. In the second case the range was only 0 < m <= 20000. - Attila Pethő, Posting to the Number Theory List, Nov 11 2017
