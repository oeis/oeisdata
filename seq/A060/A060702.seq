%N A060702 Orders of finite groups that have trivial center.
%C A060702 Apart from the first element 1 this is a subsequence of A056868 because a nilpotent group has nontrivial center. If n = 0 mod 6 or n >= 6 and n = 2 mod 4 then n is in this sequence.
%C A060702 If n >= 6 and n == 2 mod 4 then n is a member of the sequence because of the dihedral group of order 2(2k+1). In addition, if p is a prime and p == 1 mod 4 then n=4p is a member of the sequence; however, if p == 3 mod 4 and p>5, then n=4p is not a member of the sequence. Furthermore, if n=pq where p and q are distinct odd primes with p<q, then pq belongs to the sequence if and only if p divides q-1. - _Des MacHale_ and Mossie Crowe, Jul 05 2005
%C A060702 This sequence is closed under multiplication. - _Eric M. Schmidt_, Aug 27 2012

%e A060702 The symmetric group S_3 of order 6 has trivial center so 6 belongs to the sequence.
%Y A060702 Cf. A056868, A059806.
%Y A060702 For the corresponding numbers of centerless groups of these orders see A357900.
