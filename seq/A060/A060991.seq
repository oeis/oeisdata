%N A060991 a(n) is the smallest positive integer c such that the equation A049820(x) = c has exactly n solutions.
%C A060991 Essentially same as A236565, except here for n=2 we have a(2) = 1 instead of A236565(2) = 0, because this sequence requires its terms to be strictly positive. - _Antti Karttunen_, Oct 09 2015
%e A060991 The solution sets of smallest values of x-d(x) deviations with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 terms are as follows: {6}, {3, 4}, {9, 10, 12}, {25, 26, 28, 30}, {841, 842, 844, 848, 850}, {17642, 17648, 17650, 17654, 17658, 17670}. Thus difference x-d(x) for x={25, 26, 28, 30} with d(x)={3, 4, 6, 8} divisors is equally 22, so a(4)=22.
