%N A060315 a(1)=1; a(n) is the smallest positive integer that cannot be obtained from the integers {0, 1, ..., n-1} using each number at most once and the operators +, -, *, /.
%C A060315 I had written a C++ program to find the smallest positive integer that cannot be obtained from the integers {1,2,...,n-1} using each number exactly once and the operators +,-,*,/. The result is the same as this sequence through n=11. It takes the program two days to find the result for n=11. We still don't know whether the two sequences are the same for n greater than 11. - _Zhao Hui Du_, Oct 01 2008
%C A060315 The first 12 terms are the same as the result of using all numbers from 0 to n-1 exactly once and only the operators +,-,* (so we could get all integers less than a(n) without the operator /). The minimal number which could not be reached using all numbers from 0 to 12 exactly once and only operators +,-,* is 10539427. But I have still not verified whether it is a(13). - _Zhao Hui Du_, Oct 08 2008
%C A060315 a(13) has now been verified by computer. - _Zhao Hui Du_, Nov 05 2008

%F A060315 a(n) >= A354423(n-1). - _Michael S. Branicky_, Jun 05 2022
%e A060315 For n=4 the numbers available for use are {0,1,2,3} and we can get 6=2*3, 7=2*3+1, 8=2*(1+3), 9=3*(1+2), but we cannot get 10, hence a(4) = 10.
