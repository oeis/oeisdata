%N A288488 Theta series of the 12-dimensional lattice of hyper-roots D_3(SU(3)).
%C A288488 This lattice is the k=3 member of the family of lattices of SU(3) hyper-roots associated with the module-category D_k(SU(3)) over the fusion (monoidal) category A_k(SU(3)).The Grothendieck group of the former, a finite abelian category, is a Z+ - module over the Grothendieck ring of the latter, with a basis given by isomorphism classes of simple objects.
%C A288488 Simple objects of A_k(SU(3)) are irreducible integrable representations of the affine Lie algebra of SU(3) at level k.
%C A288488 The classification of module-categories over A_k(SU(3)) was done, using another terminology, by P. Di Francesco and J.-B Zuber, and by A. Ocneanu (see refs below): it contains several infinite families that exist for all values of the positive integer k (among others one finds the A_k(SU(3)) themselves and the orbifold series D_k(SU(3))), and several exceptional cases for special values of k.
%C A288488 To every such module-category one can associate a set of hyper-roots (see refs below) and consider the corresponding lattice, denoted by the same symbol.
%C A288488 Members of the sub-family D_{3s} are special because they  have self-fusion (they are flat, in operator algebra parlance). D_3(SU(3)) is the smallest member of the D_{3s} family (s=1).
%C A288488 With k=3 there are r=((k+1)(k+2)/2 -1)/3+3=6 simple objects. The rank of the lattice is 2r=12. The lattice is defined by 2r(k+3)^2/3=144 hyper-roots of norm 6. Det =3^12. The first shell is made of vectors of norm 4, they are not hyper-roots, and the only vectors of the lattice that belong to the second shell, of norm 6, are precisely the hyper-roots. Note: for lattices of type A_k(SU(3)), vectors of shortest length and hyper-roots coincide, here this is not so.
%C A288488 The lattice is rescaled (q --> q^2): its theta function starts as 1 + 36*q^4 + 144*q^6 +... See example.
