%N A288461 Chebyshev coefficients of density of states of FCC lattice.
%C A288461 This is the sequence of integers z^n g_n for n=0,1,2,3,... where g_n are the coefficients in the Chebyshev polynomial expansion of the density of states of the face-centered cubic lattice (z=12), g(w) = 1 / (Pi*sqrt(1-w^2)) * Sum_{n>=0} (2-delta_n) g_n T_n(w). Here |w| <= 1 and delta is the Kronecker delta.  The coordination number is z=6.  Note that the triangular lattice is sometimes called the hexagonal lattice.
%C A288461 The Chebyshev coefficients, g_n, are related to the number of walks on the lattice that return to the origin, W_n, as g_n = Sum_{k=0..n} a_{nk} z^{-k} W_k, where z is the coordination number of the lattice and a_{nk} are the coefficients of Chebyshev polynomials such that T_n(x) = Sum_{k=0..n} a_{nk} x^k. The author was unable to obtain a closed form for z^n g_n.
