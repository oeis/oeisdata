%N A288313 Let b(k) denote A056240(k); the sequence lists numbers b(2n) where for all m > n, b(2m) > b(2n).
%C A288313 This is an ascending subsequence of A056240 with even argument terms.
%C A288313 After the first three (even) terms, a(1)=b(2)=2, a(2)=b(4)=4, a(3)=b(6)=8 respectively, all subsequent terms are odd (semiprime) numbers of the form 3*r, for r = primes 5, 7, 11, 13, .... The graph of all odd-valued terms a(n) for n>=4 is a straight line (y = 3*x-9), corresponding to b(2*n) = 3*(2*n)-9 = 3 *(2*n-3) = 3*r, where r = 2*n-3 is prime, and n is in sequence A098090. The sequence a(n) for n>=4 is identical term for term to A001748(n) for n>=3. In other words, for n>=4, a(n)=3*A000040(n-1).
%C A288313 If, for any even number n>=6, n-3 is prime, then A056240(n) belongs to this sequence.
%F A288313 a(1)=2, a(2)=4, a(3)=8, and for n>=4, a(n) = 3*A000040(n-1).
%e A288313 a(1)=2 is included because for all n > 1, b(2n) > 2; likewise a(2)=b(4)=4, and a(3)=b(6)=8 are included. The first odd term, a(4)=b(8)=15, is included since for all n>4, b(2n) > 15. b(12)=35 is not in this sequence because b(14) = 33 < 35, and only ascending terms are permitted.
%Y A288313 Cf. A000040, A001748, A056240, A098090. Essentially the same as A063534.
