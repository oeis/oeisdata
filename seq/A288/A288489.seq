%N A288489 Theta series of the 24-dimensional lattice of hyper-roots D_6(SU(3))
%C A288489 This lattice is the k=6 member of the family of lattices of SU(3) hyper-roots associated with the module-category D_k(SU(3)) over the fusion (monoidal) category A_k(SU(3)).
%C A288489 The Grothendieck group of the former, a finite abelian category, is a Z+ - module over the Grothendieck ring of the latter, with a basis given by isomorphism classes of simple objects.
%C A288489 Simple objects of A_k(SU(3)) are irreducible integrable representations of the affine Lie algebra of SU(3) at level k.
%C A288489 The classification of module-categories over A_k(SU(3)) was done, using another terminology, by P. Di Francesco and J.-B Zuber, and by A. Ocneanu (see refs below): it contains several infinite families that exist for all values of the positive integer k (among others one finds the A_k(SU(3)) themselves and the orbifold series D_k(SU(3))), and several exceptional cases for special values of k.
%C A288489 To every such module-category one can associate a set of hyper-roots (see refs below) and consider the corresponding lattice, denoted by the same symbol.
%C A288489 Members of the sub-family D_{3s} are special because they  have self-fusion (they are flat, in operator algebra parlance). D_6(SU(3)) is the second smallest member of the D_{3s} family (s=2).
%C A288489 With k=6 there are r=((k+1)(k+2)/2 -1)/3+3=12 simple objects. The rank of the lattice is 2r=24. The lattice is defined by 2r(k+3)^2/3=648 hyper-roots of norm 6. Det =3^18. The first shell is made of vectors of norm 4, they are not hyper-roots, and the second shell, of norm 6, contains not only the hyper-roots but other vectors. Note: for lattices of type A_k(SU(3)), vectors of shortest length and hyper-roots coincide, here this is not so.
%C A288489 The lattice is rescaled (q --> q^2): its theta function starts as 1 + 162*q^4 + 2322*q^6 +... See example.
