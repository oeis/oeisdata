%N A288203 Fixed point of the mapping 00->0010, 1->010, starting with 00.
%C A288203 From _Michel Dekking_, Oct 12 2018: (Start)
%C A288203 Here is a proof of the conjecture on the sequence of lengths 2, 4, 8, 18, 38, 80, ... of the iterates of the mapping (see also A288206). We note first that the mapping SR: 00->0010, 1->010, is an algorithmic procedure given by StringReplace in Mathematica. This makes it hard in general to describe iterates of it. However, here is an analysis of what happens in this particular case. Let
%C A288203       H:=100, T:=1000, Z:=00, E1:=100, E2:=10.
%C A288203 Then
%C A288203       SR(H)  = 0100010  = 0 T H 0^{-1},
%C A288203       SR(T)  = 01000100 = 0 T T 0^{-1},
%C A288203       SR(Z)  = 0010     = Z H 0^{-1},
%C A288203       SR(E1) = 0100010  = 0 T E2,
%C A288203       SR(E2) = 0100     = 0 E1.
%C A288203 Let sigma be the morphism on the alphabet {H,T,Z,E1,E2} given by
%C A288203 sigma(Z)=ZH, sigma(H)=TH, sigma(T)=TT, sigma(E1)= T E2, sigma(E2)= E1.
%C A288203 Then, because the 0's at the beginning of SR(H), SR(T), SR(E1) and SR(E2) always cancel, we have
%C A288203       sigma^n(Z E2) = SR^{n+1}(Z)   for n=0,1,2,...,
%C A288203 Examples:
%C A288203       Z E2 = 0010 = SR(00),
%C A288203       sigma(Z E2) = ZH E1 = 00100100,
%C A288203       sigma^2(Z E2) = ZHTHT E2 = 001001000100100010.
%C A288203 From this it follows that
%C A288203       (a(n)) = delta(x),
%C A288203 where x = (x(n)) is the infinite word with x(1)=Z fixed by sigma, i.e., sigma(x)=x, and delta is the 'decoration' morphism
%C A288203       delta(H):=100, delta(T):=1000, delta(Z):=00.
%C A288203 Note that sigma is a reducible morphism, and that E1 and E2 do not occur in the fixed point x (they only occur at the end of the SR^n(00)).
%C A288203 We also proved that the number of letters (Z's, H's, T's, E1's, and E2's) in the n-th iterate of SR is equal to the vector/matrix/vector product
%C A288203       (2,3,4,3,2) M^n (1,0,0,0,1)^T,
%C A288203 where (1,0,0,0,1)^T is the transpose of (1,0,0,0,1), and M is the incidence matrix of the morphism sigma, i.e., M equals
%C A288203       |1 0 0 0 0|
%C A288203       |1 1 0 0 0|
%C A288203       |0 1 2 1 0|
%C A288203       |0 0 0 0 1|
%C A288203       |0 0 0 1 0|
%C A288203 The characteristic polynomial of M is equal to chi(u) = u^5-4*u^4+4*u^3+2*u^2-5*u+2. It follows therefore from the Cayley-Hamilton theorem that the sequence of lengths satisfies the linear recursion
%C A288203       a(n+5) = 4*a(n+4) - 4*a(n+3) - 2*a(n+2) + 5*a(n+1) - 2*a(n).
%C A288203 This is not the conjectured recursion a(n+4) = 3*a(n+3) - a(n+2) - 3*a(n+1) + 2*a(n) from A288206.
%C A288203 However, if we add this recursion to the shifted recursion a(n+5) = 3*a(n+4) - a(n+3) - 3*a(n+2) + 2*a(n+1), then we obtain the recursion above. This proves the conjecture.
%C A288203 (End)
%C A288203 From the analysis above it follows that the frequencies of 0 and 1 in (a(n)) exist and are equal to 3/4 and 1/4. - _Michel Dekking_, Oct 12 2018
