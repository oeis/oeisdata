%N A288493 First differences of A006878 (record new trajectory lengths of Collatz function) (Hailstone sequence).
%C A288493 The sequence appears to return to 1 again and again forever when the minimal possible new record of just (previous record + 1) is reached at the latest possible value of 2X. Through 129 there are only 2 entries, a(17) and a(21), that are a minimal new record but aren't 2X.
