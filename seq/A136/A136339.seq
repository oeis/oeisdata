%N A136339 a(1) = 1; for all n >= 2, we choose a(n) to be as small as possible so that for all i = 1, ..., n, the sequence of the i-th divisors of a(1), a(2), ..., a(n) is nonincreasing.
%C A136339 The original definition of this sequence was: a(n+1) = smallest number such that the d-th divisors of a(n), a(n+1) will never increase. [What is d?]
%C A136339 Similar to A094783, except that only members of the sequence can disqualify larger numbers.
%e A136339 What is a(13), the term after 720? It cannot be 840 because 720's 13th smallest divisor is 18 and 840's 13th smallest divisor is 20 > 18.
%Y A136339 Cf. A094783.
%K A136339 nonn

%E A136339 Edited by _N. J. A. Sloane_, Apr 04 2008. I tried to rewrite the definition to make it precise, but I am not sure I have done this correctly.
