%N A007030 Non-Hamiltonian simplicial polyhedra with n nodes.
%C A007030 a(18) = 1879665 was conjectured by Dillencourt and verified by direct computation by _Sean A. Irvine_, Sep 26 2017.
%C A007030 By Steinitz's theorem non-Hamiltonian simplicial polyhedra correspond to non-Hamiltonian maximal planar graphs. - _William P. Orrick_, Feb 25 2021

%e A007030 The unique non-Hamiltonian maximal planar graph of 11 vertices is the Goldner-Harary graph. A corresponding simplicial polyhedron can be obtained by attaching a tetrahedron to each of the six faces of a triangular bipyramid. - _William P. Orrick_, Feb 25 2021
