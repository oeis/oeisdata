%N A007656 Mass number of the most abundant isotope of the element with atomic number Z = n.
%C A007656 Mass number of the most abundant of the stable nuclides with atomic number equal to n. If there is no stable isotope, choose the one with the longest decay time.
%C A007656 Sequence is not well-defined, since the entries may change as more properties of the elements are discovered.
%C A007656 Moss and Winter give the atomic weight for Dysprosium (Dy) as "162.50(3)"; rounded to 163 rather than 162.
%C A007656 Bentor, Winter and Moss all give 145 as the atomic weight of the most stable isotope of Promethium (Pm), as opposed to 147, which was in the original data (between 144 and 150).
%C A007656 Also referred to as the mass number A of the most abundant and stable nuclide with atomic number Z=n. We have A = Z + N, where N is the neutron number A058317(n). - _Lekraj Beedassy_, Oct 08 2005
%C A007656 The 'abundance' refers to the Earth's crust. It may differ when applied to other astronomical bodies and/or to the known Universe. The mass numbers (once also referred to as the isotope numbers) are always integer, and should not be confused with relative atomic masses (or isotope masses), nor with (mean) atomic weights, none of which are ever integer. - _Stanislav Sykora_, Apr 26 2015
%C A007656 Andreas von Antropoff was an Estonian-born German chemist, who is known to have coined the term Neutronium and developed a temporarily and widely used periodic table of elements in 1926. - _Jinyuan Wang_, Apr 30 2019

%e A007656 Calcium (Ca), with atomic number 20, has 6 stable isotopes with mass numbers 40, 42, 43, 44, 46, and 48. Of these, 40Ca is the most abundant in Earth's crust (96.941%). Hence a(20)=40. Note: The relative atomic mass of 40Ca is 39.96259..., smaller than 40 because of the mass equivalent of the nuclear bonding energy, while the conventional mean atomic weight of Calcium is presently 40.078(4), by IUPAC 2009. - _Stanislav Sykora_, Apr 26 2015

%E A007656 There are several errors in this sequence. It looks to me that the rounded atomic weights were used rather than the mass number of the most abundant of the stable nuclides with atomic number equal to n. Thus for instance, a(28) should be 58, not 59 and a(29) should be 63, not 64. In fact, in all cases the parity of a(n) should be the same as n (both odd or both even). - _David Terr_, Oct 05 2006
%E A007656 I fixed all the entries I could find in which a(n) was incorrect, based on the online table of isotopic abundances at http://www.sisweb.com/referenc/source/exactmas.htm. - _David Terr_, Apr 06 2009
%E A007656 a(n) has the same parity as n for all stable elements except beryllium (n=4, a(n)=9), nitrogen (n=7, a(n)=14) and platinum (n=78, a(n)=195). - _David Terr_, Apr 07 2009
