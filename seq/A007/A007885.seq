%N A007885 Numbers n such that balanced sequences exist with n distinct elements.
%C A007885 A nondecreasing sequence a_1, ..., a_n is called balanced if the n-1 quantities D(a_1,...,a_k)+D(a_(k+1),...,a_n) (1<=k<=n-1) are all equal, where D(a_1,...,a_k) is the sum of the absolute deviations of the a's from their median. Up to affine equivalence, there's a unique balanced sequence of any given length.
%C A007885 n is in the sequence iff n=1, 2, or 4, or n is prime and the multiplicative group of integers mod n is generated by -1 and 2.
%C A007885 1, 2, 4, and primes p such that either +2 or -2 (or both) are primitive roots mod p. - _Joerg Arndt_, Jun 03 2012

%e A007885 n=5 is in the sequence, since 0,2,3,4,6 is balanced. n=6 is not because every balanced sequence of length 6 is affinely equivalent to 0,1,2,2,3,4.
