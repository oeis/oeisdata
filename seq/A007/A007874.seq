%N A007874 Distinct perimeter lengths of polygons with regularly spaced vertices.
%C A007874 For n points on a circle there are floor(n/2) distinct line segment lengths. Hence an upper bound for a(n) is the number of compositions of n into floor(n/2) nonnegative parts, which is A127040(n-2). To find a(n), the length of A052558(n-2) paths must be computed. - _T. D. Noe_, Jan 13 2007 [edited by _Petros Hadjicostas_, Jul 19 2018]
%e A007874 Consider n=4. Label the points on the circle A,B,C and D. Suppose that AB has unit length. Then a(4)=2 because the two 4-gons are ABCDA and ACBDA, with perimeters 4 and 2+2*sqrt(2), respectively.
