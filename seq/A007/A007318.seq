%N A007318 Pascal's triangle read by rows: C(n,k) = binomial(n,k) = n!/(k!*(n-k)!), 0 <= k <= n.
%C A007318 A. W. F. Edwards writes: "It [the triangle] was first written down long before 1654, the year in which Blaise Pascal wrote his Traité du triangle arithmétique, but it was this work that brought together all the different aspects of the numbers for the first time. In it Pascal developed the properties of the number as a piece of pure mathematics ... and then, in a series of appendices, showed how these properties were relevant to the study of the figurate numbers, to the theory of combinations, to the expansion of binomial expressions, and to the solution of an important problem in the theory of probability." (A. W. F. Edwards, Pascal's Arithmetical Triangle, Johns Hopkins University Press (2002), p. xiii)
%C A007318 Edwards reports that the naming of the triangle after Pascal was done first by Montmort in 1708 as the "Table de M. Pascal pour les combinaisons" and then by De Moivre in 1730 as the "Triangulum Arithmeticum PASCALANIUM". (Edwards, p. xiv)
%C A007318 In China, Yang Hui in 1261 listed the coefficients of (a+b)^n up to n=6, crediting the expansion to Chia Hsein's Shih-so suan-shu circa 1100. Another prominent early use was in Chu Shih-Chieh's Precious Mirror of the Four Elements in 1303. (Edwards, p. 51)
%C A007318 In Persia, Al-Karaji discovered the binomial triangle "some time soon after 1007", and Al-Samawal published it in the Al-bahir some time before 1180. (Edwards, p. 52)
%C A007318 In India, Halayuda's commentary (circa 900) on Pingala's treatise on syllabic combinations (circa 200 B.C.E.) contains a clear description of the additive computation of the triangle. (Amulya Kumar Bag, Binomial Theorem in Ancient India, p. 72)
%C A007318 Also in India, the multiplicative formula for C(n,k) was known to Mahavira in 850 and restated by Bhaskara in 1150. (Edwards, p. 27)
%C A007318 In Italy, Tartaglia published the triangle in his General trattato (1556), and Cardano published it in his Opus novum (1570). (Edwards, p. 39, 44) - _Russ Cox_, Mar 29 2022

%C A007318 Binomial(n+k-1, k) is the number of ways a sequence of length k can be partitioned into n subsequences (see the Naish link).
%C A007318 Binomial(n+k-1, k) is also the number of n- (or fewer) digit numbers written in radix at least k whose digits sum to k. For example, in decimal, there are binomial(3+3-1,3)=10 3-digit numbers whose digits sum to 3 (see A052217) and also binomial(4+2-1,2)=10 4-digit numbers whose digits sum to 2 (see A052216). This relationship can be used to generate the numbers of sequences A052216 to A052224 (and further sequences using radix greater than 10). (End)

%C A007318 Given matrices R and S with R(n,k) = binomial(n,k)*r(n-k) and S(n,k) = binomial(n,k)*s(n-k), then R*S = T where T(n,k) = binomial(n,k)*[r(.)+s(.)]^(n-k), umbrally. And, the e.g.f.s for the row polynomials of R, S and T are, respectively, exp(x*t)*exp[r(.)*x], exp(x*t)*exp[s(.)*x] and exp(x*t)*exp[r(.)*x]*exp[s(.)*x] = exp{[t+r(.)+s(.)]*x}. The row polynomials are essentially Appell polynomials. See A132382 for an example. - _Tom Copeland_, Aug 21 2008

Let S(n) denote the subset of permutations p_1...p_n of {1,...,n} such that p_(i+1) - p_i <= 1 for i = 1,...,n-1. Then binomial(n,k) gives the number of permutations in S(n+1) with k descents.

%C A007318 Consider the n-th diagonal of the triangle as a sequence b(n) with n starting at 0. From it form a new sequence by leaving the 0th term as is, and thereafter considering all compositions of n, taking the product of b(i) over the respective numbers i in each composition, adding terms corresponding to compositions with an even number of parts subtracting terms corresponding to compositions with an odd number of parts. Then the n-th row of the triangle is obtained, with every second term multiplied by -1, followed by infinitely many zeros. For sequences starting with 1, this operation is a special case of a self-inverse operation, and therefore the converse is true. - _Thomas Anton_, Jul 05 2021

%F A007318 There is a relation between the e.g.f.'s of the rows and the diagonals of the triangle, namely, exp(x) * e.g.f. for row n = e.g.f. for diagonal n.
