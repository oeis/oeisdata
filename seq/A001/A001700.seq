%N A001700 a(n) = binomial(2*n+1, n+1): number of ways to put n+1 indistinguishable balls into n+1 distinguishable boxes = number of (n+1)-st degree monomials in n+1 variables = number of monotone maps from 1..n+1 to 1..n+1.
%C A001700 To show for example that C(2n+1, n+1) is the number of monotone maps from 1..n + 1 to 1..n + 1, notice that we can describe such a map by a nondecreasing sequence of length n + 1 with entries from 1 to n + 1. The number k of increases in this sequence is anywhere from 0 to n. We can specify these increases by throwing k balls into n+1 boxes, so the total is Sum_{k = 0..n} C((n+1) + k - 1, k) = C(2*n+1, n+1).
%C A001700 Also number of ordered partitions (or compositions) of n + 1 into n + 1 parts. E.g., a(2) = 10: 003, 030, 300, 012, 021, 102, 120, 210, 201, 111. - Mambetov Bektur (bektur1987(AT)mail.ru), Apr 17 2003

%C A001700 Also the numerator of the constant term in the expansion of cos^(2*n)(x) or sin^(2*n)(x) when the denominator is 2^(2*n-1). - _Robert G. Wilson v_
%C A001700 Consider the expansion of cos^n(x) as a linear combination of cosines of multiple angles. If n is odd, then the expansion is a combination of a*cos((2*k-1)*x)/2^(n-1) for all 2*k - 1 <= n. If n is even, then the expansion is a combination of a*cos(2k*x)/2^(n-1) terms plus a constant. "The constant term, [a(n)/2^(2n-1)], is due to the fact that [cos^2n(x)] is never negative, i.e., electrical engineers would say the average or 'dc value' of [cos^(2*n)(x)] is [a(n)/2^(2*n-1)]. The dc value of [cos^(2*n-1)(x)] on the other hand, is zero because it is symmetrical about the horizontal axis, i.e., it is negative and positive equally." Nahin[62] - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Aug 01 2002
%C A001700 Also number of times a fixed Dyck word of length 2*k occurs in all Dyck words of length 2*n + 2*k.

%C A001700 a(n+1) is the determinant of the n X n matrix m(i, j) = binomial(2*n-i, j). - _Benoit Cloitre_, Aug 26 2003

Example: For prime 29 = 4*7 + 1 use a(7-1) = 1716 = (2*7)!/(2*7!*7!), 5 = 1716 mod 29 and 2 = 5*(2*7)! mod 29, then 29 = 5*5 + 2*2.
%C A001700 The number of compositions of 2*n, say c_1 + c_2 + ... + c_k = 2n, satisfy that Sum_{i = 1..j} c_i < 2*j for all j = 1..k, or equivalently, the number of subsets, say S, of [2*n-1] = {1, 2, ..., 2*n-1} with at least n elements such that if 2k is in S, then there must be at least k elements in S smaller than 2k. E.g., a(2) = 3 because we can write 4 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 1 + 2 + 1. - Ricky X. F. Chen (ricky_chen(AT)mail.nankai.edu.cn), Jul 30 2006
