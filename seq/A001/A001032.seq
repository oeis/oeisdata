%N A001032 Numbers k such that sum of squares of k consecutive integers >= 1 is a square.
%C A001032 It was shown by Watson (and again by Ljunggren) that if 0^2 + 1^2 + ... + r^2 is a square then r = 0, 1 or 24.
%C A001032 The terms up to 1391 are == 0, 1, 2, 9, 11, 16, 23 (mod 24). Start number is in A007475(n). Square root of sum is in A076215(n). - _Ralf Stephan_, Nov 04 2002
%C A001032 The solutions in the case n=2 are in A001652 or A082291.
%C A001032 For k > 5 and k == 1 or 5 (mod 6), it appears that all k^2 are here. When n is not a square, the solution to problem 6552 shows that there are an infinite number of sums of n consecutive squares that equal a square. There are only a finite number when n is a square. For example, the only sum having 49 terms is 25^2 + ... + 73^2 = 357^2. - _T. D. Noe_, Jan 20 2011
%C A001032 In the previous comment, "it appears" can be removed because the k^2 squares beginning at (k^2+1)(k^2-25)/48 sum to a square. - _Thomas Andrews_, Feb 14 2011
%C A001032 See A180442 for the complementary problem of finding numbers n such that there are consecutive squares beginning with n^2 that sum to a square.
%C A001032 From _Thomas Andrews_, Feb 22 2011: (Start)
%C A001032 Elementary necessary conditions for n to be in this sequence:
%C A001032   1. If n=s^2b where b is squarefree, then:
%C A001032      a. If s is divisible by 3 then b is divisible by 3.
%C A001032      b. If s is divisible by 2, then b is divisible by 2.
%C A001032      c. If b is divisible by 3, then b = 6 (mod 9)
%C A001032      d. b only has prime factors p where 3 is a square, modulo p. (So, p=2, p=3, or p=12k+-1)
%C A001032   2.
%C A001032      a. If n+1 is divisible by 3, then (n+1)/3 is the sum of two perfect squares.
%C A001032      b. If n+1 is not divisible by 3, then n+1 is the sum of two perfect squares
%C A001032 The smallest number which satisfies these conditions which is not in this sequence is 842.
%C A001032 These conditions can be used to establish the conjecture of Ralf Stephan, above, that all the terms are == 0, 1, 2, 9, 11, 16, or 23 (mod 24). (End)
%C A001032 The numbers satisfying the above conditions but which are not in this sequence can be found in A274469. - _Christopher E. Thompson_, Jun 28 2016
