%N A001045 Jacobsthal sequence (or Jacobsthal numbers): a(n) = a(n-1) + 2*a(n-2), with a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1; also a(n) = nearest integer to 2^n/3.
%C A001045 _Don Knuth_ points out (personal communication) that Jacobsthal may never have seen the actual values of this sequence. However, Horadam uses the name "Jacobsthal sequence", such an important sequence needs a name, and there is a law that says the name for something should never be that of its discoverer. - _N. J. A.

%C A001045 Correspondence: a(n) = b(n)*2^(n-1), where b(n) is the sequence of the arithmetic means of previous two terms defined by b(n) = 1/2*(b(n-1) + b(n-2)) with initial values b(0) = 0, b(1) = 1; the g.f. for b(n) is B(x) := x/(1-(x^1+x^2)/2), so the g.f. A(x) for a(n) satisfies A(x) = B(2*x)/2. Because b(n) converges to the limit lim (1-x)*B(x) = 1/3*(b(0) + 2*b(1)) = 2/3 (for x --> 1), it follows that a(n)/2^(n-1) also converges to 2/3 (see also A103770). - _Hieronymus Fischer_, Feb 04 2006

%C A001045 2^(n+1) = 2*A005578(n) + 2*a(n) + 2*A000975(n-1). Let A005578(n), a(n), A000975(n-1) = triangle (a, b, c). Then ((S-c), (S-b), (S-a)) = (A005578(n-1), a(n-1), A000975(n-2)). Example: (a, b, c) = (11, 11, 10) = (A005578(5), a(5), A000975(4)). Then ((S-c), (S-b), (S-a)) = (6, 5, 5) = (A005578(4), a(4), A000975(3)). - _Gary W. Adamson_, Dec 24 2007

%C A001045 The sequence emerges in using iterated deletion of strictly dominated strategies to establish the best-response solution to the Cournot duopoly problem as a strictly dominant strategy. The best response of firm 1 to firm 2's chosen quantity is given by q*_1 = 1/2*(a - c - q_2), where a is reservation price, c is marginal cost, and q_2 is firm two's chosen quantity. Given that q_2 is in [o, a - c], q*_1 must be in [o, 1/2*(a - c)]. Since costs are symmetric, we know q_2 is in [0, 1/2*(a - c)]. Then we know q*_1 is in [1/4*(a - c), 1/2*(a - c)]. Continuing in this way, the sequence of bounds we get (factoring out a - c) is {1/2, 1/4, 3/8, 5/16, ...}; the numerators are the Jacobsthal numbers. - _Michael Chirico_, Sep 10 2011

%C A001045 This sequence is connected with the Collatz problem. We consider the array T(i, j) where the i-th row gives the parity trajectory of i, for example for i = 6, the infinite trajectory is 6 -> 3 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1... and T(6, j) = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, ..., 1, 0, 0, 1, ...]. Now, we consider the sum of the digits "1" of each column. We obtain the sequence a(n) = Sum_{k = 1..2^n} T(k, n) = Sum _{k = 1..2^n} digits "1" of the n-th column. Because a(n) + a(n+1) = 2^n, then a(n+1) = Number of digits "0" among the 2^n elements of the n-th column. - _Michel Lagneau_, Jan 11 2012
%C A001045 3!*a(n-1) is apparently the trace of the n-th power of the adjacency matrix of the complete 3-graph, a 3 X 3 matrix with diagonal elements all zero and off-diagonal all ones. The off-diagonal elements for the n-th power are all equal to a(n) while each diagonal element seems to be a(n) + 1 for an even power and a(n) - 1 for an odd. These are related to the lengths of closed paths on the graph (see Delfino and Viti's paper). - _Tom Copeland_, Nov 06 2012

Replacing the 5's with 9's gives ((1+sqrt(9))^n - (1-sqrt(9))^n)/(2^n*sqrt(9)) = (2^n+(-1)^(n+1))/3 = (2^n-(-1)^(n))/3 = a(n). - _Jeffrey R. Goodwin_, May 27 2011
