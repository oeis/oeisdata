%N A001997 Number of different shapes formed by bending a piece of wire of length n in the plane.
%C A001997 The wire is marked into n equal segments by n-1 marks, is bent at right angles at each of one or more of these points, making each segment parallel to one of two rectangular axes. (Stays in plane, bends are of 0 or +-90 degs.) May cross itself but is not self-coincident over a finite length.
%C A001997 A trail is a path which may cross itself but does not reuse an edge. This sequence counts undirected trails on the square lattice up to rotation and reflection. Directed trails are counted by A006817.
%C A001997 Much less is known about the three-dimensional problem.
