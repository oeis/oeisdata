%C A001147 From _Tom Copeland_, Nov 13 2007, clarified in first and extended in second paragraph, Jun 12 2021: (Start)
%C A001147 a(n) has the e.g.f. (1-2x)^(-1/2) = 1 + x + 3*x^2/2! + ..., whose reciprocal is (1-2x)^(1/2) = 1 - x - x^2/2! - 3*x^3/3! - ... = b(0) - b(1)*x - b(2)*x^2/2! - ... with b(0) = 1 and b(n+1) = -a(n) otherwise. By the formalism of A133314, Sum_{k=0..n} binomial(n,k)*b(k)*a(n-k) = 0^n where 0^0 := 1. In this sense, the sequence a(n) is essentially self-inverse. See A132382 for an extension of this result. See A094638 for interpretations.
%C A001147 This sequence aerated has the e.g.f. e^(t^2/2) = 1 + t^2/2! + 3*t^4/4! + ... = c(0) + c(1)*t + c(2)*t^2/2! + ... and the reciprocal e^(-t^2/2); therefore, Sum_{k=0..n} cos(Pi k/2)*binomial(n,k)*c(k)*c(n-k) = 0^n; i.e., the aerated sequence is essentially self-inverse. Consequently, Sum_{k=0..n} (-1)^k*binomial(2n,2k)*a(k)*a(n-k) = 0^n. (End)
%C A001147 From _Ross Drewe_, Mar 16 2008: (Start)
%C A001147 This is also the number of ways of arranging the elements of n distinct pairs, assuming the order of elements is significant but the pairs are not distinguishable, i.e., arrangements which are the same after permutations of the labels are equivalent.
%C A001147 If this sequence and A000680 are denoted by a(n) and b(n) respectively, then a(n) = b(n)/n! where n! = the number of ways of permuting the pair labels.
%C A001147 For example, there are 90 ways of arranging the elements of 3 pairs [1 1], [2 2], [3 3] when the pairs are distinguishable: A = { [112233], [112323], ..., [332211] }.
%C A001147 By applying the 6 relabeling permutations to A, we can partition A into 90/6 = 15 subsets: B = { {[112233], [113322], [221133], [223311], [331122], [332211]}, {[112323], [113232], [221313], [223131], [331212], [332121]}, ....}
%C A001147 Each subset or equivalence class in B represents a unique pattern of pair relationships. For example, subset B1 above represents {3 disjoint pairs} and subset B2 represents {1 disjoint pair + 2 interleaved pairs}, with the order being significant (contrast A132101). (End)

%C A001147 a(n) = the number of upper-triangular matrix representations required for the symbolic representation of a first order central moment of the multivariate normal distribution of dimension 2(n-1), i.e., E[X_1*X_2...*X_(2n-2)|mu=0, Sigma].

%C A001147 Aerated with intervening zeros (1,0,1,0,3,...) = a(n) (cf.

%C A001147 a(n) = the number of relaxed compacted binary trees of right height at most one of size n. A relaxed compacted binary tree of size n is a directed acyclic graph consisting of a binary tree with n internal nodes, one leaf, and n pointers. It is constructed from a binary tree of size n, where the first leaf in a post-order traversal is kept and all other leaves are replaced by pointers. These links may point to any node that has already been visited by the post-order traversal. The right height is the maximal number of right-edges (or right children) on all paths from the root to any leaf after deleting all pointers. The number of unbounded relaxed compacted binary trees of size n is A082161(n). See the Genitrini et al. link. - _Michael Wallner_, Jun 20 2017
%C A001147 Also the number of distinct adjacency matrices in the n-ladder rung graph. - _Eric W. Weisstein_, Jul 22 2017
%C A001147 From _Christopher J. Smyth_, Jan 26 2018: (Start)
%C A001147 a(n) = the number of essentially different ways of writing a probability distribution taking n+1 values as a sum of products of binary probability distributions. See comment of Mitch Harris above. This is because each such way corresponds to a full binary tree with n+1 leaves, with the leaves labeled by the values. (This comment is due to Niko Brummer.)
%C A001147 Also the number of binary trees with root labeled by an (n+1)-set S, its n+1 leaves by the singleton subsets of S, and other nodes labeled by subsets T of S so that the two daughter nodes of the node labeled by T are labeled by the two parts of a 2-partition of T. This also follows from Mitch Harris' comment above, since the leaf labels determine the labels of the other vertices of the tree.
%C A001147 (End)
%C A001147 a(n) is the n-th moment of the chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom (equivalent to Coleman's Apr 06 2004 comment). - _Bryan R. Gillespie_, Mar 07 2021
%C A001147 Let b(n) = 0 for n odd and b(2k) = a(k); i.e., let the sequence b(n) be an aerated version of this entry. After expanding the differential operator (x + D)^n and normal ordering the resulting terms, the integer coefficient of the term x^k D^m is n! b(n-k-m) / [(n-k-m)! k! m!] with 0 <= k,m <= n and (k+m) <= n. E.g., (x+D)^2 = x^2 + 2xD + D^2 + 1 with D = d/dx. The result generalizes to the raising (R) and lowering (L) operators of any Sheffer polynomial sequence by replacing x by R and D by L and follows from the disentangling relation e^{t(L+R)} = e^{t^2/2} e^{tR} e^{tL}. Consequently, these are also the coefficients of the reordered 2^n permutations of the binary symbols L and R under the condition LR = RL + 1. E.g., (L+R)^2 = LL + LR + RL + RR = LL + 2RL + RR + 1. (Cf. A344678.) - _Tom Copeland_, May 25 2021
%C A001147 From _Tom Copeland_, Jun 14 2021: (Start)
%C A001147 Lando and Zvonkin present several scenarios in which the double factorials occur in their role of enumerating perfect matchings (pairings) and as the nonzero moments of the Gaussian e^(x^2/2).
%C A001147 Speyer and Sturmfels (p. 6) state that the number of facets of the abstract simplicial complex known as the tropical Grassmannian G'''(2,n), the space of phylogenetic T_n trees (see A134991), or Whitehouse complex is a shifted double factorial.
%C A001147 These are also the unsigned coefficients of the x[2]^m terms in the partition polynomials of A134685 for compositional inversion of e.g.f.s, a refinement of A134991.
%C A001147 a(n)*2^n = A001813(n) and A001813(n)/(n+1)! = A000108(n), the Catalan numbers, the unsigned coefficients of the x[2]^m terms in the partition polynomials A133437 for compositional inversion of o.g.f.s, a refinement of A033282, A126216, and A086810. Then the double factorials inherit a multitude of analytic and combinatoric interpretations from those of the Catalan numbers, associahedra, and the noncrossing partitions of A134264 with the Catalan numbers as unsigned-row sums. (End)
%C A001147 Connections among the Catalan numbers A000108, the odd double factorials, values of the Riemann zeta function and its derivative for integer arguments, and series expansions of the reduced action for the simple harmonic oscillator and the arc length of the spiral of Archimedes are given in the MathOverflow post on the Riemann zeta function. - _Tom Copeland_, Oct 02 2021
%C A001147 b(n) = a(n) / (n! 2^n) = Sum_{k = 0..n} (-1)^n binomial(n,k) (-1)^k a(k) / (k! 2^k) = (1-b.)^n, umbrally; i.e., the normalized double factorial a(n) is self-inverse under the binomial transform. This can be proved by applying the Euler binomial transformation for o.g.f.s Sum_{n >= 0} (1-b.)^n x^n = (1/(1-x)) Sum_{n >= 0} b_n (x / (x-1))^n to the o.g.f. (1-x)^{-1/2} = Sum_{n >= 0} b_n x^n. Other proofs are suggested by the discussion in Watson on pages 104-5 of transformations of the Bessel functions of the first kind with b(n) = (-1)^n binomial(-1/2,n) = binomial(n-1/2,n) = (2n)! / (n! 2^n)^2. - _Tom Copeland_, Dec 10 2022

%F A001147 Recurrence equation: a(n) = (3*n - 2)*a(n-1) - (n - 1)*(2*n - 3)*a(n-2) with a(1) = 1 and a(2) = 3.
%F A001147 The sequence b(n) = A087547(n), beginning [1, 4, 52, 608, 12624, ... ], satisfies the same second-order recurrence equation.
