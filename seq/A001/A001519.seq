It appears that beginning with any randomly taken sequence S(n), iterates of the operations M * S(n), -> M * ANS, -> P * ANS, etc. (or starting with P) will rapidly converge upon a two-sequence limit cycle of (1, 2, 5, 13, 34, ...) and (1, 1, 3, 8, 21, ...). - _Gary W.

%C A001519 From _Wolfdieter Lang_, Mar 30 2020: (Start)
%C A001519 a(n) is the upper left entry of the n-th power of the 2 X 2 tridiagonal matrix M_2 = Matrix([1,1], [1,2]) from A322602: a(n) = ((M_2)^n)[1,1].
%C A001519 Proof: (M_2)^2 = 3*M + 1_2 (with the 2 X 2 unit matrix 1_2) from the characteristic polynomial of M_2 (see a comment in A322602) and the Cayley-Hamilton theorem. The recurrence M^n = M*M^(n-1) leads to (M_n)^n = S(n, 3)*1_2 + S(n-a, 3)*(M - 3*1_2), for n >= 0, with S(n, 3) = F(2(n+1)) = A001906(n+1). Hence ((M_2)^n)[1,1] = S(n, 3) - 2*S(n-1, 3) = a(n) = F(2*n-1) = (1/(2*r+1))*r^(2*n-1)*(1 + (1/r^2)^(2*n-1)), with r = rho(5) = A001622 (golden ratio) (see the first Aug 31 2004 formula, using the recurrence of S(n, 3), and the _Michael Somos_ Oct 28 2002 formula). This proves a conjecture of _Gary W. Adamson_ in A322602.
%C A001519 The ratio a(n)/a(n-1) converges to r^2 = rho(5)^2 = A104457 for n -> infinity (see the a(n) formula in terms of r), which is one of the statements by _Gary W. Adamson_ in A322602. (End)
%C A001519 a(n) is the number of ways to stack coins with a bottom row of n coins such that any coin not on the bottom row touches exactly two coins in the row below, and all the coins on any row are contiguous [Wilf, 2.12]. - _Greg Dresden_, Jun 29 2020
%C A001519 a(n) is the upper left entry of the (2*n)-th power of the 4 X 4 Jacobi matrix L with L(i,j)=1 if |i-j| = 1 and L(i,j)=0 otherwise. - _Michael Shmoish_, Aug 29 2020
%C A001519 All positive solutions of the indefinite binary quadratic F(1, -3, 1) := x^2 - 3*x*y + y^2, of discriminant 5, representing -1 (special Markov triples (1, y=x, z=y) if y <= z) are [x(n), y(n)] = [abs(F(2*n+1)), abs(F(2*n-1))], for n = -infinity..+infinity. (F(-n) = (-1)^(n+1)*F(n)). There is only this single family of proper solutions, and there are no improper solutions. [See also the Floor van Lamoen Nov 29 2001 comment, which uses this negative n, and my Jan 30 2015 comment.] - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Sep 23 2020
%C A001519 These are the denominators of the lower convergents to the golden ratio, phi; they are also the numerators of the upper convergents (viz. 1/1 < 3/2 < 8/5 < 21/13 < ... < phi < ... 13/8 < 5/3 < 2/1). - _Clark Kimberling_, Jan 02 2022
