%N A001006 Motzkin numbers: number of ways of drawing any number of nonintersecting chords joining n (labeled) points on a circle.
%C A001006 Number of 4321-, (3412,2413)-, (3412,3142)- and 3412-avoiding involutions in S_n.
%C A001006 Number of sequences of length n-1 consisting of positive integers such that the first and last elements are 1 or 2 and the absolute difference between any 2 consecutive elements is 0 or 1. - _Jon Perry_, Sep 04 2003
%C A001006 From _David Callan_, Jul 15 2004: (Start)
%C A001006 Also number of Motzkin n-paths: paths from (0,0) to (n,0) in an n X n grid using only steps U = (1,1), F = (1,0) and D = (1,-1).
%C A001006 Number of Dyck n-paths with no UUU. (Given such a Dyck n-path, change each UUD to U, then change each remaining UD to F. This is a bijection to Motzkin n-paths. Example with n=5: U U D U D U U D D D -> U F U D D.)
%C A001006 Number of Dyck (n+1)-paths with no UDU. (Given such a Dyck (n+1)-path, mark each U that is followed by a D and each D that is not followed by a U. Then change each unmarked U whose matching D is marked to an F. Lastly, delete all the marked steps. This is a bijection to Motzkin n-paths. Example with n=6 and marked steps in small type: U U u d D U U u d d d D u d -> U U u d D F F u d d d D u d -> U U D F F D.) (End)
%C A001006 a(n) is the number of strings of length 2n+2 from the following recursively defined set: L contains the empty string and, for any strings a and b in L, we also find (ab) in L. The first few elements of L are e, (), (()), ((())), (()()), (((()))), ((()())), ((())()), (()(())) and so on. This proves that a(n) is less than or equal to C(n), the n-th Catalan number. See Orrick link (2024). - Saul Schleimer (saulsch(AT)math.rutgers.edu), Feb 23 2006 (Additional linked comment added by _William P. Orrick_, Jun 13 2024.)
%C A001006 a(n) = number of Dyck n-paths all of whose valleys have even x-coordinate (when path starts at origin). For example, T(4,2)=3 counts UDUDUUDD, UDUUDDUD, UUDDUDUD. Given such a path, split it into n subpaths of length 2 and transform UU->U, DD->D, UD->F (there will be no DUs for that would entail a valley with odd x-coordinate). This is a bijection to Motzkin n-paths. - _David Callan_, Jun 07 2006
%C A001006 Also the number of standard Young tableaux of height <= 3. - _Mike Zabrocki_, Mar 24 2007
%C A001006 a(n) is the number of RNA shapes of size 2n+2. RNA Shapes are essentially Dyck words without "directly nested" motifs of the form A[[B]]C, for A, B and C Dyck words. The first RNA Shapes are []; [][]; [][][], [[][]]; [][][][], [][[][]], [[][][]], [[][]][]; ... - Yann Ponty (ponty(AT)lri.fr), May 30 2007
%C A001006 The sequence is self-generated from top row A going to the left starting (1,1) and bottom row = B, the same sequence but starting (0,1) and going to the right. Take dot product of A and B and add the result to n-th term of A to get the (n+1)-th term of A. Example: a(5) = 21 as follows: Take dot product of A = (9, 4, 2, 1, 1) and (0, 1, 1, 2, 4) = (0, + 4 + 2 + 2 + 4) = 12; which is added to 9 = 21. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Oct 27 2008
%C A001006 Equals A005773 / A005773 shifted (i.e., (1,2,5,13,35,96,...) / (1,1,2,5,13,35,96,...)). - _Gary W. Adamson_, Dec 21 2008
%C A001006 Starting with offset 1 = iterates of M * [1,1,0,0,0,...], where M = a tridiagonal matrix with [0,1,1,1,...] in the main diagonal and [1,1,1,...] in the super and subdiagonals. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Jan 07 2009
%C A001006 a(n) is the number of involutions of {1,2,...,n} having genus 0. The genus g(p) of a permutation p of {1,2,...,n} is defined by g(p)=(1/2)[n+1-z(p)-z(cp')], where p' is the inverse permutation of p, c = 234...n1 = (1,2,...,n), and z(q) is the number of cycles of the permutation q. Example: a(4)=9; indeed, p=3412=(13)(24) is the only involution of {1,2,3,4} with genus > 0. This follows easily from the fact that a permutation p of {1,2,...,n} has genus 0 if and only if the cycle decomposition of p gives a noncrossing partition of {1,2,...,n} and each cycle of p is increasing (see Lemma 2.1 of the Dulucq-Simion reference). [Also, redundantly, for p=3412=(13)(24) we have cp'=2341*3412=4123=(1432) and so g(p)=(1/2)(4+1-2-1)=1.] - _Emeric Deutsch_, May 29 2010
%C A001006 Let w(i,j,n) denote walks in N^2 which satisfy the multivariate recurrence w(i,j,n) = w(i, j + 1, n - 1) + w(i - 1, j, n - 1) + w(i + 1, j - 1, n - 1) with boundary conditions w(0,0,0) = 1 and w(i,j,n) = 0 if i or j or n is < 0. Then a(n) = Sum_{i = 0..n, j = 0..n} w(i,j,n) is the number of such walks of length n. - _Peter Luschny_, May 21 2011
%C A001006 a(n)/a(n-1) tends to 3.0 as N->infinity: (1+2*cos(2*Pi/N)) relating to longest odd N regular polygon diagonals, by way of example, N=7: Using the tridiagonal generator [cf. comment of Jan 07 2009], for polygon N=7, we extract an (N-1)/2 = 3 X 3 matrix, [0,1,0; 1,1,1; 0,1,1] with an e-val of 2.24697...; the longest Heptagon diagonal with edge = 1. As N tends to infinity, the diagonal lengths tend to 3.0, the convergent of the sequence. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Jun 08 2011
%C A001006 Number of (n+1)-length permutations avoiding the pattern 132 and the dotted pattern 23\dot{1}. - _Jean-Luc Baril_, Mar 07 2012
%C A001006 Number of n-length words w over alphabet {a,b,c} such that for every prefix z of w we have #(z,a) >= #(z,b) >= #(z,c), where #(z,x) counts the letters x in word z. The a(4) = 9 words are: aaaa, aaab, aaba, abaa, aabb, abab, aabc, abac, abca. - _Alois P. Heinz_, May 26 2012
%C A001006 Number of length-n restricted growth strings (RGS) [r(1), r(2), ..., r(n)] such that r(1)=1, r(k)<=k, and r(k)!=r(k-1); for example, the 9 RGS for n=4 are 1010, 1012, 1201, 1210, 1212, 1230, 1231, 1232, 1234. - _Joerg Arndt_, Apr 16 2013
%C A001006 Number of length-n restricted growth strings (RGS) [r(1), r(2), ..., r(n)] such that r(1)=0, r(k)<=k and r(k)-r(k-1) != 1; for example, the 9 RGS for n=4 are 0000, 0002, 0003, 0004, 0022, 0024, 0033, 0222, 0224. - _Joerg Arndt_, Apr 17 2013
%C A001006 Number of (4231,5276143)-avoiding involutions in S_n. - _Alexander Burstein_, Mar 05 2014
%C A001006 a(n) is the number of increasing unary-binary trees with n nodes that have an associated permutation that avoids 132. For more information about unary-binary trees with associated permutations, see A245888. - _Manda Riehl_, Aug 07 2014
%C A001006 a(n) is the number of involutions on [n] avoiding the single pattern p, where p is any one of the 8 (classical) patterns 1234, 1243, 1432, 2134, 2143, 3214, 3412, 4321. Also, number of (3412,2413)-, (3412,3142)-, (3412,2413,3142)-avoiding involutions on [n] because each of these 3 sets actually coincides with the 3412-avoiding involutions on [n]. This is a complete list of the 8 singles, 2 pairs, and 1 triple of 4-letter classical patterns whose involution avoiders are counted by the Motzkin numbers. (See Barnabei et al. 2011 reference.) - _David Callan_, Aug 27 2014
%C A001006 From _Tony Foster III_, Jul 28 2016: (Start)
%C A001006 A series created using 2*a(n) + a(n+1) has Hankel transform of F(2n), offset 3, F being the Fibonacci bisection, A001906 (empirical observation).
%C A001006 A series created using 2*a(n) + 3*a(n+1) + a(n+2) gives the Hankel transform of Sum_{k=0..n} k*Fibonacci(2*k), offset 3, A197649 (empirical observation). (End)
%C A001006 Conjecture: (2/n)*Sum_{k=1..n} (2k+1)*a(k)^2 is an integer for each positive integer n. - _Zhi-Wei Sun_, Nov 16 2017
%C A001006 The Rubey and Stump reference proves a refinement of a conjecture of René Marczinzik, which they state as: "The number of 2-Gorenstein algebras which are Nakayama algebras with n simple modules and have an oriented line as associated quiver equals the number of Motzkin paths of length n." - _Eric M. Schmidt_, Dec 16 2017
%C A001006 Number of U_{k}-equivalence classes of Łukasiewicz paths. Łukasiewicz paths are P-equivalent iff the positions of pattern P are identical in these paths. - _Sergey Kirgizov_, Apr 08 2018
%C A001006 If tau_1 and tau_2 are two distinct permutation patterns chosen from the set {132,231,312}, then a(n) is the number of valid hook configurations of permutations of [n+1] that avoid the patterns tau_1 and tau_2. - _Colin Defant_, Apr 28 2019
%C A001006 Number of permutations of length n that are sorted to the identity by a consecutive-321-avoiding stack followed by a classical-21-avoiding stack. - _Colin Defant_, Aug 29 2020
%C A001006 From _Helmut Prodinger_, Dec 13 2020: (Start)
%C A001006 a(n) is the number of paths in the first quadrant starting at (0,0) and consisting of n steps from the infinite set {(1,1), (1,-1), (1,-2), (1,-3), ...}.
%C A001006 For example, denoting U=(1,1), D=(1,-1), D_ j=(1,-j) for j >= 2, a(4) counts UUUU, UUUD, UUUD_2, UUUD_3, UUDU, UUDD, UUD_2U, UDUU, UDUD.
%C A001006 This step set is inspired by {(1,1), (1,-1), (1,-3), (1,-5), ...}, suggested by Emeric Deutsch around 2000.
%C A001006 See Prodinger link that contains a bijection to Motzkin paths. (End)
%C A001006 Named by Donaghey (1977) after the Israeli-American mathematician Theodore Motzkin (1908-1970). In Sloane's "A Handbook of Integer Sequences" (1973) they were called "generalized ballot numbers". - _Amiram Eldar_, Apr 15 2021
%C A001006 Number of Motzkin n-paths a(n) is split into A107587(n), number of even Motzkin n-paths, and A343386(n), number of odd Motzkin n-paths. The value A107587(n) - A343386(n) can be called the "shadow" of a(n) (see A343773). - _Gennady Eremin_, May 17 2021
%C A001006 Conjecture: If p is a prime of the form 6m+1 (A002476), then a(p-2) is divisible by p. Currently, no counterexample exists for p < 10^7. Personal communication from _Robert Gerbicz_: mod such p this is equivalent to A066796 with comment: "Every A066796(n) from A066796((p-1)/2) to A066796(p-1) is divisible by prime p of form 6m+1". - _Serge Batalov_, Feb 08 2022
%C A001006 From _Rob Burns_, Nov 11 2024: (Start)
%C A001006 The conjecture is proved in the 2017 paper by Rob Burns in the Links below. The result is contained in Tables 4 and 5 of the paper, which show that a(p-2) == 0 (mod p) when p == 1 (mod 6) and a(p-2) == -1 (mod p) when p == -1 (mod 6).
%C A001006 In fact, the 2017 paper by Burns establishes more general congruences for a(p^k - 2) where k >= 1.
%C A001006 If p == 1 (mod 6) then a(p^k - 2) == 0 (mod p) for k >= 1.
%C A001006 If p == -1 (mod 6) then a(p^k - 2) == -1 (mod p) when k is odd and a(p^k - 2) == 0 (mod p) when k is even.
%C A001006 These are consequences of the transitions provided in Tables 4, 5 and 6 of the paper.
%C A001006 The 2024 paper by Nadav Kohen also proves the conjecture. Proposition 6 of the paper states that a prime p divides a(p-2) if and only if p = (1 mod 3). (End)
%C A001006 From _Peter Bala_, Feb 10 2022: (Start)
%C A001006 Conjectures:
%C A001006 (1) For prime p == 1 (mod 6) and n, r >= 1, a(n*p^r - 2) == -A005717(n-1) (mod p), where we take A005717(0) = 0 to match Batalov's conjecture above.
%C A001006 (2) For prime p == 5 (mod 6) and n >= 1, a(n*p - 2) == -A005773(n) (mod p).
%C A001006 (3) For prime p >= 3 and k >= 1, a(n + p^k) == a(n) (mod p) for 0 <= n <= (p^k - 3).
%C A001006 (4) For prime p >= 5 and k >= 2, a(n + p^k) == a(n) (mod p^2) for 0 <= n <= (p^(k-1) - 3). (End)
%C A001006 The Hankel transform of this sequence with a(0) omitted gives the period-6 sequence [1, 0, -1, -1, 0, 1, ...] which is A010892 with its first term omitted, while the Hankel transform of the current sequence is the all-ones sequence A000012, and also it is the unique sequence with this property which is similar to the unique Hankel transform property of the Catalan numbers. - _Michael Somos_, Apr 17 2022
%C A001006 The number of terms in which the exponent of any variable x_i is not greater than 2 in the expansion of Product_{j=1..n} Sum_{i=1..j} x_i. E.g.: a(4) = 9: 3*x1^2*x2^2, 4*x1^2*x2*x3, 2*x1^2*x2*x4, x1^2*x3^2, x1^2*x3*x4, 2*x1*x2^2*x3, x1*x2^2*x4, x1*x2*x3^2, x1*x2*x3*x4. - _Elif Baser_, Dec 20 2024
%C A001006 The Hankel matrix corresponding to this sequence factorizes as T * Transpose(T), where T is the lower unitriangular array A064189 (row reverse of the Motzkin triangle A026300). Hence the Hankel determinants are all equal to 1 as stated above by Michael Somos. - _Peter Bala_, Nov 23 2025
