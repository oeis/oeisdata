%N A330359 Race of lucky numbers of the form 4*k - 1 vs. 4*k + 1 is tied at the a(n)-th lucky number.
%C A330359 All the terms are even by definition. For each term m, there are m/2 lucky numbers of the form 4*k - 1 and m/2 lucky numbers of the form 4*k + 1 up to the m-th lucky number.
%C A330359 Gardiner et al. (1956) noted that the ratio between the numbers of lucky numbers of the form 4*k - 1 and 4*k + 1 seems to tend to 1, with a preponderance, at first, of the lucky numbers of the form 4*k + 3.

%e A330359 6 is in the sequence since the first 6 lucky numbers are 1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 15, half of them are of the form 4*k-1 (3, 7, 15) and half of the form 4*k+1 (1, 9, 13).
