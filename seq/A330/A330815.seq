%N A330815 Numbers with a record number of divisors whose binary expansion is palindromic.
%C A330815 Indices of records of A175242.
%C A330815 The corresponding number of binary palindromic divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, 22, 26, 27, 33, 34, 35, 37, 39, 47, 50, 51, 54, 55, 56, 57, 60, 70, 71, 74, 76, 90, ...
%e A330815 9 is a term since it has 3 binary palindromic divisors, 1, 3 and 9, whose binary representations are 1, 11 and 1001. All the numbers below 9 have less than 3 binary palindromic divisors.
