%N A330854 Primes of the form 6k + 1 preceding the first-occurrence gaps in A330853.
%C A330854 Subsequence of A002476. First differs from A268926 in that that sequence does not include 283; all terms of A268926 are in this sequence but many terms of this sequence are not in A268926.

%F A330854 a(n) = A330855(n) - A330853(n).
%e A330854 The first two primes of the form 6k + 1 are 7 and 13, so a(1) = 7. The next prime of that form is 19, and the gap 19 - 13 = 6 already occurred; so a new term is not added to the sequence. The next prime of the form 6k + 1 is 31, and the gap 31 - 19 = 12 is occurring for the first time; therefore a(2) = 19.
%e A330854 The gap between 241 and the next prime of the form 6k + 1 (271) is 30. So 241 is in the sequence.
%e A330854 Although the gap between 283 and 307 is only 24 (which is less than 30), the gap is of a size not previously encountered. So 283 is in the sequence.
