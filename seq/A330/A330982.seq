%N A330982 Remeven numbers: having an even remainder modulo any of their digits, digit 0 forbidden.
%C A330982 The sequence is a subset of the zeroless numbers A052382 which have asymptotic density 0 because they are in the complement of pandigital numbers A171102 which have asymptotic density 1. But does it have finite density within A052382?
%C A330982 It contains all repdigit numbers A010785 \ {0} and also all numbers with only even digits A014263 \ {0} and all numbers divisible by all of their digits, A034838.
%C A330982 The graph is self-similar, it looks the same whether we take the graph of values < 10^4 or that of values < 10^5 etc.: In the range 0 < a(n) < 10^(k+1), there are jumps of size > 10^k/9 where the values cross the limits d*10^k, 1 <= d <= 9 (from a(n) <= {d-1}9...9 to a(n+1) >= d1...1, since 0's are forbidden).
%C A330982 There are N = (0, 9, 48, 303, 2190, 15871, 119442, 930324, ...) terms below 10^k, k >= 0; these N(k) are also the indices of terms a(N(k)) = 10^k-1 (k>0), which are followed by repunits a(N(k)+1) = a(N(k+1))/9 (k >= 0).
%C A330982 The smallest zeroless pandigital term is a(8455060) = 123567894. - _Giovanni Resta_, Jan 08 2020

%e A330982 12 is in the sequence because 12 % 1 = 0 and 12 % 2 = 0 both are even, where x % y is the remainder of x divided by y.
%e A330982 13 is not in the sequence because 13 % 3 = 1 is odd.
