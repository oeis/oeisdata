%N A330849 First element of the first maximal isospectral chain of length n.
%C A330849 Isospectral Chain Conjecture: There exist isospectral chains of any positive length.
%C A330849 A number N is the first element of the first isospectral chain of length n if there is no integer M < N such that M is also the first element of an isospectral chain of length n. Then a(n)=N, where N is the first element of the first isospectral chain of length n.
%C A330849 Two integers are isospectral if they have the same spectral basis. An isospectral chain of length n is a sequence N1,...,Nn of integers with the same spectral basis such that N1=2*N2=...=n*Nn and index(Nk)=k. A chain is maximal if it cannot be extended to an isospectral chain of length n+1.
%C A330849 The spectral sum of an integer N with at least two prime factors is the sum of the elements of its spectral basis, and is of the form k*N+1, where k is a positive integer. Then we say that N has index k, index(N)=k.
