%N A330339 Boustrophedon primes: write the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, ... in a triangle on a square grid in the boustrophedon manner, ending a row when a prime is reached; sequence lists primes that appear in the zeroth column.
%C A330339 Eric Angelini's illustration shows the first 19 rows of the triangle. Each row ends when a prime is reached, and the next row starts directly under this prime but moves in the opposite direction.
%C A330339 The extended illustration from _Walter Trump_ resembles a giant ski run.
%C A330339 _Hans Havermann_'s plots of A330545, linked here, extend Walter Trump's graph to 4*10^8 rows (probably the longest ski run in the world). Only the turns are shown, and the illustration has been turned sideways.
%C A330339 A330545(k) = 0 iff prime(k) is a term of the present sequence. In a sense A330545 and the simpler A330547 are the more fundamental sequences and show the connection between the present problem and the ordinary primes and their alternating sums.
%C A330339 Note that because primes > 2 are odd, a prime can only appear in column 0 at the end of a row that is moving towards the left. A prime appearing in a row moving to the right will always appear in an odd-numbered column (and in particular, not in the zero column).
%C A330339 Furthermore the column number mod 4 uniquely determines the residue class of primes mod 4 in that column. If the column number is 0,1,2,3 mod 4 then the primes in that column are 1,3,3,1 respectively (see the "Notes" link). In particular, a(n) == 1 mod 4. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 04 2020
%C A330339 Note that the primes > 2 in column one and two are the primes in A282178.
%C A330339 Note on the links: The illustrations from Angelini and Trump show all the terms 0,1,2,3,4,..., while those of Havermann and Sloane just show the primes (as in A330545).
