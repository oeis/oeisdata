%N A330022 Length of shortest binary string containing all palindromes of length n as substrings.
%C A330022 Greedy supersequence algorithms give the upper bounds a(7) <= 60, a(8) <= 74, a(9) <= 142, a(10) <= 180, a(11) <= 344, a(12) <= 410, a(13) <= 798. Probably some of these are tight.
%C A330022 The value for a(6) was computed by checking all 8! arrangements of the 8 palindromes of length 3, optimizing overlaps.
%C A330022 Computing a(n) can be posed as a Hamiltonian path problem on the weighted complete graph with the binary palindromes of length n as vertices and the overlap distances between them as weights. - _Max Alekseyev_, Nov 22 2025
