%N A330487 Sum of those x(p)*y(p) with p <= n, where p is a prime congruent to 1 modulo 4, and p = x(p)^2 + y(p)^2 with 1 <= x(p) <= y(p).
%C A330487 Conjecture: Let b(n) be the sum of all primes p <= n with p == 1 (mod 4). Then a(n)/b(n) = 1/Pi + O(1/sqrt(n)).
%C A330487 A classical theorem of Euler (conjectured by Fermat) states that any prime p == 1 (mod 4) can be written uniquely as x^2 + y^2 with 1 <= x <= y.
%C A330487 For any prime p == 1 (mod 4), we obviously have a(p) > a(p-1). Also, b(n) >= 2*a(n) for all n > 0 since x^2 + y^2 >= 2*x*y.
%C A330487 Via computation we find that a(10^10) = 353452066546904620, b(10^10) = 1110397615780409147, and 3.14157907 < b(10^10)/a(10^10) < 3.14157908.

%e A330487 a(5) = 2 since 5 is the first prime congruent to 1 mod 4 and 5 = 1^2 + 2^2 with 1*2 = 2.
%e A330487 a(13) = 8 since 13 = 2^2 + 3^2 is the second prime congruent to 1 mod 4 and 1*2 + 2*3 = 8.
