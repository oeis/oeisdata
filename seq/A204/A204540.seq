%N A204540 Numbers k whose basins (as defined in A204539) equal 1.
%C A204540 Only seven such numbers are known. Referring to A204539, we cannot be certain that these are the only numbers k with the property basin(k) = 1, but there are no others for k less than 12,000,000. Furthermore the average value of basin(k) is approximately equal to k/3 for large values of k, which makes it extremely unlikely that another one will ever be found.
%C A204540 For unknown reasons, all integers > 5 with basin equal to 1 or 2 are even. See A185001 for the list of known numbers with basin = 2.
