%N A234692 Decimal value of the bitmap of active segments in 7-segment display of the number n, variant 2 ("abcdefg" scheme: bits represent segments in clockwise order).
%C A234692 The bits 0-6 are assigned to the segments according to the "abcdefg" scheme (top, upper right, lower right, bottom, lower left, upper left, center), cf. section "Displaying letters" of the Wikipedia page (3rd column of the table). Other conventions are common in engineering (as well for the segment-to-bit correspondence as for the glyphs), see sequence A234691, the Wikipedia page and the comment after the Example for a(7).
%C A234692 For n > 9, each of the digits of the base-10 representation is coded in a separate group of 7 bits, for example, a(10) = a(1)*2^7 + a(0) = 831.
%C A234692 Alternatively, for n >= 10 one could define a(n) to represent a 7-segment variant of the characters A-Z and/or a-z, as in hexadecimal or base-64 encoding. In that case, one could also use a few more bits for additional segments, e.g., four half-diagonals to represent K, M, N, R, V, X, Z correctly and S distinctly from 5. But as mentioned on the Wikipedia page, a possible ambiguity of representations of alphabetic characters is not always an obstacle to common use, since whole words are usually readable nonetheless.
%C A234692 The Hamming weight A000120 of the terms of this sequence yields the count of lit segments, A010371(n) = A000120(a(n)) = A000120(A234691(n)). For that sequence, 5 other variants are in OEIS, depending on the number of segments used to represent digits 6, 7 and 9: A063720 (6', 7', 9'), A277116 (7', 9'), A074458 (9') and A006942 (7'), where x' means that the "sans serif" variant (one segment less than here) is used for digit x. - _M.

%F A234692 a(n) = a(n%10) + a(floor(n/10))*2^7, where % is the remainder operator. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jun 17 2020
%e A234692 a(7) = 39 = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^5, because the digit 7 is represented as
%e A234692 " _ " : bit 0,
%e A234692 "| |" : bits 5+1,
%e A234692 "  |" : bit 2,
%e A234692 and no bit 3 (bottom "_") nor 4 (lower left "|") nor 6 (central "-").
%e A234692 Although other glyphs do exist as well for 6, 9, 0 and maybe other digits, "7" is probably the digit where an alternate representation (without the upper left "|") is as common as the one we chose here.

%Y A234692 Cf. A234691 for a variant where bits 0-6 represent, in this order, the segments: top, upper left, upper right, center, lower left, lower right, bottom.
%Y A234692 Cf. A000120 (Hamming weight), A010371 and variants A063720, A277116, A074458 and A006942: see comments.
