%N A234010 Free polyominoes with 2n squares, having 180-degree rotational symmetry about a square mid-side.
%C A234010 The number of free polyominoes of size 2n that have 180-degree rotational symmetry about a point that coincides with the midpoint of a side a square, independently of any reflective symmetry. Note that for polyominoes which have a hole in the center, the center of rotation will be the midpoint of a side of a square within the hole, rather than being the midpoint of a side of a square of the polyomino itself. The sequence is defined for 2n rather than n as odd-sized polyominoes cannot have the required symmetry.
