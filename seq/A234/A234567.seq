%N A234567 Number of ways to write n = k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that p = phi(k) + phi(m)/2 + 1 and P(p-1) are both prime, where phi(.) is Euler's totient function and P(.) is the partition function (A000041).
%C A234567 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 727.
%C A234567 (ii) For the strict partition function q(.) (cf. A000009), any n > 93 can be written as k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that p = phi(k) + phi(m)/2 + 1 and q(p-1) - 1 are both prime.
%C A234567 (iii) If n > 75 is not equal to 391, then n can be written as k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that f(k,m) - 1, f(k,m) + 1 and q(f(k,m)) + 1 are all prime, where f(k,m) = phi(k) + phi(m)/2.
%C A234567 Part (i) of the conjecture implies that there are infinitely many primes p with P(p-1) prime.
