%N A234008 Free polyominoes with 2n squares, having 180-degree rotational symmetry about a square mid-side, but no reflective symmetry.
%C A234008 The number of free polyominoes of size 2n that have 180-degree rotational symmetry about a point that coincides with the midpoint of a side a square, and that have not at the same time any reflective symmetry. Note that for polyominoes which have a hole in the center, the center of rotation will be the midpoint of a side of a square within the hole, rather than being the midpoint of a side of a square of the polyomino itself. The sequence is defined for 2n rather than n as odd-sized polyominoes cannot have the required symmetry.
%C A234008 The sequence enumerates a subset of the polyominoes enumerated by A006747.
