%N A303030 Number of unlabeled connected loopless multigraphs with n nodes of degree 3 or less and with single or double edges.
%C A303030 For n >= 1, a(n) is also the number of hydronitrogen molecules containing only n nitrogen trivalent (octet rule satisfying) atoms. So for example, diazene is counted but hydrazoic acid is not because the former has only trivalent nitrogens and the latter has two non-trivalent nitrogens.
%C A303030 Some of the molecules are theoretical and may or may not exist due to their strained geometries.
%C A303030 Apparently the same as A243391 for n > 2. - _Georg Fischer_, Oct 16 2018
%C A303030 This is the case since A243391 gives the number of loopless multigraphs with nodes of degree 3 or less. The extra graph in A243391 is the 3-regular graph on 2 nodes. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Mar 20 2020
%F A303030 a(n) = A243391(n) for n > 2. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Mar 20 2020
%e A303030 a(3) = 4 because there are 4 molecules satisfying the above condition: triazane, triazene, triazirine, triazidirine.
%e A303030 Note: hydrazoic acid is not counted because there are 2 nitrogens not satisfying the octet rule (one has a positive formal charge and the other one has a negative one).
%e A303030 Graphically, a(3) = 4 because there are 4 graphs satisfying the above condition: the linear graph, the linear graph with one double edge, the triangle graph, and the triangle graph with one double edge. - _Michael B. Porter_, Apr 28 2018
