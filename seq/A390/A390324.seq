%N A390324 Smallest order m > 0 for which there are n nonisomorphic nonsolvable finite groups of order m, or 0 if no such order exists.
%H A390324 Max Horn, <a href="https://groups.quendi.de/">Numbers of isomorphism types of finite groups of given order</a>
%e A390324 a(1)=60 since 60 is the smallest order with a single nonsolvable group (the alternating group on 5 letters), and all smaller orders have no nonsolvable groups.
