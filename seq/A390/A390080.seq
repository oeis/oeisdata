%N A390080 Even numbers k such that Sum_{i=1..r} i*(k-i) = Sum_{j=1..s} j*(j+k) for some integers r and s.
%C A390080 Place k at the fulcrum of a massless seesaw. Then place the next r smaller positive numbers to the left and the next s larger numbers to the right. Suppose that each number creates a torque about the fulcrum equal to the product of the number and its distance from the fulcrum. The number k is in the sequence if r and s can be found to balance the seesaw; that is, the torque on the left balances the torque on the right.
%C A390080 This sequence extends the idea of A094550 by accounting for the distance from each number to the fulcrum.
%C A390080 Terms in the sequence satisfy 2*s^2 + (1+3*k-2*r)*s + r*(1-3*k+2*r) = 0 for some r and s.
%C A390080 All odd numbers satisfy the equation above: if k = 2*t+1, then a solution is r = 2*t and s = t.

%e A390080 14 is a term because the numbers 4 through 13 create a total torque of 385 units on the left and the numbers 15 through 20 create an opposing torque of 385 units on the right.
