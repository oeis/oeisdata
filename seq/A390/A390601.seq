%N A390601 Positive integers (not multiples of 10) whose (radix-10) constant congruence speed is greater than the minimum of the (radix-10) constant congruence speeds of all their prime factors.
%C A390601 Consider the radix-10 numeral system. For the definition of "constant congruence speed", see A373387 (see also the comments to A391434).
%C A390601 In general, if the product of two positive integers r and s is not divisible by 10, then the constant congruence speed of r*s is necessarily >= the minimum of the constant congruence speeds of r and s: the present sequence arises from the > case.
%C A390601 By definition, this sequence contains no primes (since the constant congruence speed of any prime equals that of its unique prime divisor).

%e A390601 a(1) = 15 since the constant congruence speed of 3 is 1, the constant congruence speed of 5 is 2, the constant congruence speed of 15 is 4, and 4 > min{1,2}.
