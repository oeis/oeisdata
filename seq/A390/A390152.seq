%N A390152 Numerator of average duration of the game "Tug of Luck" played with n coins.
%C A390152 In the game "Tug of Luck" n coins are tossed. Player A gets the tails and B gets the heads. Thereafter they take turns rolling a die until one player has gotten rid of all their coins and wins. If a 1 or 2 is rolled the player picks one coin from the opponent, if a 3 or 4 is rolled, both players get rid of one coin and if a 5 or 6 is rolled the player gives one coin to the opponent.
%C A390152 The average game duration approaches 1.5*n when n tends to infinity, see link to the proof by S. Norkus.

%e A390152 a(2) = 1 because if two coins are tossed, the probability that either A or B wins immediately is 0.5. In the case both A and B get 1 coin, the game ends after the first roll of the die. Hence the average game duration is 1/2.
%e A390152 a(3) = 9: In 3/4 of the cases one player gets 1 coin and the other player 2 coins. In this case it takes on average 3/2 rounds with the die to end the game. Hence the average game duration is 9/8.
