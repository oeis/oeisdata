%N A390439 Exponentially noncomposite numbers: numbers whose prime factorization exponents are all noncomposites.
%C A390439 Subsequence of A209061, A386803 and A388972, and first differs from them at n = 62: A209061(62) = A386803(62) = A388972(62) = 64 = 2^6 is not a term in this sequence.
%C A390439 First differs from A115063 and A369939 at n = 122: a(122) = 128 = 2^7 is neither a term in A115063 nor a term in A369939. Also, A115063(243) = A369939(243) = 256 = 2^8 is the least term in A115063 and A369939 that is not a term in this sequence.
%C A390439 Except for a(1) = 1, a subsequence of A140823 and differs from it by not having the terms 48, 64, 80, 112, 144, ... .
%C A390439 The squarefree numbers (A005117) and numbers whose prime factorization exponents are all primes (A056166) are all terms in this sequence. Each term in this sequence has a unique representation as the product of two coprime numbers, one is squarefree and the other is a term in A056166.
%C A390439 The asymptotic density of this sequence is Product_{p prime} (1 - p^4 + Sum_{q prime >= 5} (1/p^q - 1/p^(q+1))) = 0.94671933735527801046... . [corrected by _Jason Yuen_, Nov 11 2025]
