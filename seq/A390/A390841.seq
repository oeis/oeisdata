%N A390841 2-valuation of Product_{k <= n} (prime(k) + 1) / (prime(k+1) - prime(k)).
%C A390841 The given product is likely to be an integer for all n, because the cumulated numerators are extremely likely to have more of any given prime factor than the smallish denominators which are the prime gaps. But can it be proved that this is indeed always the case for all prime factors?
%C A390841 The sequence appears to grow slightly sub-linearly: a(10^3) = 460, a(10^4) = 3996, a(10^5) = 35962.

%e A390841 The first factors of the product are (2+1)/1 = 3, (3+1)/2 = 2, (5+1)/2 = 3, (7+1)/4 = 2, (11+1)/2 = 6, (13+1)/4 = 7/2, (17+1)/2 = 9, (19+1)/4 = 5, (23+1)/6 = 4, (29+1)/2 = 15, (31+1)/6 = 16/3, ...
%e A390841 Therefore, for the product of the first n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... of these fractions, the cumulated number of powers of 2 is 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 8, ...
