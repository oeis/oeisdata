%N A390650 Number of tic-tac-toe positions after n plays.
%C A390650 A "play" is a single move by one player.
%C A390650 This sequence counts all distinct board positions without considering rotational or reflectional symmetry.
%C A390650 For n plays if X plays first: X has made ceiling(n/2) moves and O has made floor(n/2) moves.
%C A390650 Terminal positions (games with a winner or draw) contribute to a(n) but have no children at depth n+1.
%C A390650 The sum of all terms gives 5478, the total number of valid tic-tac-toe positions.
%C A390650 Comparison with positions up to rotation and reflection (A008907):

%C A390650 Sum |   5478        |   765     |  7.16
%C A390650 The ratio averages around 7.16, reflecting the 8 symmetries of the square (4 rotations * 2 reflections).

%e A390650 a(0) = 1: One position - the empty board.
%e A390650 a(1) = 9: X can place their mark in any of the 9 cells.
%e A390650 a(2) = 72: For each of the 9 first moves by X, O has 8 remaining positions.
%e A390650 a(3) = 252: After two plays, no games have been won yet, so all branches continue.
%e A390650 a(5) = 1260: At this depth, some games begin to terminate (X wins with 3 in a row).
%e A390650 a(9) = 78: These are all terminal positions (wins or draws).
%Y A390650 Cf. A008907 (up to symmetry), A048245 (terminal positions up to symmetry).
%Y A390650 Cf. A061526 (complete games of n X n).
