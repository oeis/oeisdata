%N A390941 "Late birds" in A390939: terms A390939(m) such that A390939(k) > A390939(m) for all k > m, where A390939 lists the keys added in the map initialized with T[1] = 1 and then repeatedly T[v] := k + (T[v] if defined else 0) for all key-value pairs (k, v) in T.
%C A390941 We know that only the entries T[k] with k listed in A390943 continue to grow, all other entries remain constant after reaching one of the values listed in A390943, the largest of which is 7424. Thus, once M(r) = min { T[k] ; k in A390943 } has grown beyond 7472, we know that M(r) is the smallest entry that can be added to the map T at and after that iteration r.
%C A390941 We also know that M(r) equals the value of T[3712] from that moment on.
%C A390941 Therefore we also know that the terms of this sequence are eventually exactly the values reached by T[3712], which are of the form 961*2^n.
%F A390941 a(n) = 961*2^(n-17) for n >= 22.
