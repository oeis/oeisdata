%N A390326 Oblong numbers not of the forms 2^k*(2^k - 1) or 2^k*(2^k + 1).
%C A390326 Oblong numbers whose distance from any perfect square of the form 4^k (A000302) is not 2^k (A000079), consisting of all oblongs (A002378) except the consecutive pairs 4^k - 2^k (A020522) and 4^k + 2^k (A063376).
%C A390326 These are the oblong numbers for which there exists a pair (x, y) with x odd satisfying x*y = m*(m + 1) and 2 <= y <= floor(x/4).
%F A390326 { m*(m + 1) : m >= 1 } \ { 2^k*(2^k - 1), 2^k*(2^k + 1) : k >= 1 }.

%F A390326 Complement of A390325 in A002378.
%e A390326 Between 4^2 = 16 and 4^3 = 64, the oblong numbers are 20 = 4*5, 30 = 5*6, 42 = 6*7, 56 = 7*8. Only 20 = 4^2 + 2^2 and 56 = 4^3 - 2^3 are at a distance of 2^t from a perfect square of the form 4^k. Then, 20 and 56 do not belong in this sequence. The others {30, 42} have distances, from any perfect square 4^k, not of the form 2^t and therefore belong to this sequence.
%e A390326 Between 4^3 = 64 and 4^4 = 256, the oblong numbers are 72 = 8*9, 90 = 9*10, 110 = 10*11, 132 = 11*12, 156 = 12*13, 182 = 13*14, 210 = 14*15, 240 = 15*16. Only 72 = 4^3 + 2^3 and 240 = 4^4 - 2^4 are at a distance of 2^t from a perfect square of the form 4^k. Then, 72 and 240 do not belong in this sequence. The others {90, 110, 132, 156, 182, 210} have distances, from any perfect square 4^k, not of the form 2^t and therefore belong to this sequence.
