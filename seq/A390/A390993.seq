%N A390993 Number of free polyaboloes (or polytans) with n cells, where the orientation of two triangles sharing a hypotenuse (making up a square) matters.
%C A390993 For normal polyaboloes (A006074), two forms are considered equivalent if they differ only by the orientation of pairs of triangles sharing a hypotenuse.
%H A390993 Pontus von Brömssen, <a href="/A390993/a390993.svg">Illustration for n<=4</a>.
%e A390993 For n = 3 there are A006074(3) = 4 free polyaboloes. For one of them, namely the polyabolo consisting of two cells sharing a hypotenuse with a third cell attached along the short side, there are two versions counted here: the common hypotenuse of the first two cells can meet the third cell either at its right angle or at one of its acute angles. Hence, a(3) = 5.
%Y A390993 Cf. A006074, A390994 (one-sided), A390995 (fixed), A390996, A390999.
