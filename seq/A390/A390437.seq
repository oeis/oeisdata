%N A390437 Numbers whose prime factorization exponents are not divisible by 3.
%C A390437 Subsequence of A386799 and first differs from it at n = 58: A386799(58) = 64 = 2^6 is not a term in this sequence.
%C A390437 First differs from A336592 at n = 58: A336592(58) = 64 = 2^6 is not a term in this sequence. Also, a(115) = 128 = 2^7 is the least term that is not a term in A336592.
%C A390437 A182120 and A366762 are subsequences. Each term in this sequence has a unique representation as the product of two coprime numbers, one in A182120 and the other in A366762.
%C A390437 Numbers whose unitary divisors (A077610) that are larger than 1 are all noncubes (A007412).
%C A390437 The asymptotic density of this sequence is Product_{p prime} (1 - 1/(p*(1+p+p^2))) = 0.95692470821076622881... .
