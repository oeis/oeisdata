%N A390510 a(n) = least k such that W(n,k) = W(n,k+1), where W(n,k) is the k-th iterate of the AN-totals mapping applied to the n-th 01-word, where all 01-words are lexicographically ordered as in A076478; see Comments.
%C A390510 The AN-totals (viz. Adjective-before-Noun) sequence of a 01-word (or binary representation, or vector of 0's and 1's) w, is defined as follows: represent w as c(1) d(1) c(2) d(2) ..., c(k) c(k) where c(i) is the number of digits d(i) in the i-th run in w. Then AN-totals(w) = [c(1)] d(1) [c(2)] d(2), where [c(i)] is the base-2 representation of total number of d(i) in w. Let w(n) be the n-th 01-word in the lexicographic ordering in A076478. Then W(n,0) = w(n), and W(n,k) = W(n,k+1) for n>=2, so that a(n) is the number of terms, inclusively, from w(n) to the first occurrence of the fixed point of the W(n,#) mapping.
%C A390510 The NA-totals (viz. Noun-before-Adjective) sequence of a 01-word (or binary representation, or vector of 0's and 1's) w, is defined as follows: represent w as c(1) d(1) c(2) d(2) ..., c(k) c(k) where c(i) is the number of digits d(i) in the i-th run in w. Then NA-totals(w) = d(1) [c(1)] d(2) [c(2)], where [c(i)] is the base-2 representation of total number of d(i) in w. Let w(n) be the n-th 01-word in the lexicographic ordering in A076478. Then W*(n,0) = w(n), and W*(n,k) = W*(n,k+1) for n>=2. Let b(n) be the number of terms, inclusively, from w(n) to the first occurrence of the fixed point of the W*(n,#) mapping. Then b(n) = a(n), although W*(n,k) is not identical to W(n,k); see Example.
