%N A390148 Rectangular array read by rows of ordered quadruples of coprime positive integers {r1..r4} for which spheres of radius r1..r4 are tangent to a plane when arranged as mutually tangent to one another, with rows in lexicographic order.
%C A390148 Primitive positive integer solutions to Descartes' theorem for 4 kissing spheres (radii r1..r4) and a plane: (1/r1 + 1/r2 + 1/r3 + 1/r4) ^ 2 = 3 * ((1/r1)^2 + (1/r2)^2 + (1/r3)^2 + (1/r4)^2).
%C A390148 There are only a finite number of rows for each distinct r1 because r2 must be <= r1 * 3 (otherwise r3 or r4 would be < r2), r3 must be <= r1 * 4 (otherwise r4 would be < r3), and there exists only 0 or 1 possible r4 given a known r1..r3.
%C A390148 Some pairs of quadruples contain coincident triples; the smallest are {52, 84, 156, 273} and {84, 156, 273, 364}. Quadruple {364, 741, 1092, 1596} has two of these: {228, 364, 741, 1092} and {741, 1092, 1596, 6916}. It is conjectured that arbitrarily large such chains of quadruples exist, but an infinite chain cannot, because the only possible such chain contains all successive terms with relative ratios of A289917, which is irrational.
%C A390148 Observed for rows n -> 1000 and conjectured for n -> oo:
%C A390148 Each quadruple comprises 3 terms that are divisible by the same and no greater positive power of 3.
%C A390148 For each term in a quadruple that is divisible by a positive power of prime p = 1 mod 3, 1 or 2 of the other terms are divisible by at least the same positive power of p.
%C A390148 If a quadruple comprises a term that is divisible by a positive power of prime p = 2 mod 3, then 3 of the terms are divisible by the same and no greater positive power of p, and that power is even. Such factors are less prevalent than p = 1 mod 3 and prevalence among them is strongly concentrated among the smallest p.
%C A390148 For each positive integer x, there exist 2^(A001221(x)-A079978(x)+1) quadruples which contain 2 terms (or more, in the singular case of {1, 3, 3, 3}) equal to 3*x^2, and no other quadruples contain repeats of the same terms.
%C A390148 For each quadruple r1..r4 in ascending order, r4 = r1 * r2 * r3 / gcd(r1, r2) / gcd(r1, r3) / gcd(r2, r3) / x, where most frequently x = 1 and otherwise x is a product of 1 or more prime(s) p = 1 mod 3, each of which is a factor of at least (and most frequently exactly) 2 of the terms r1..r3.
