%N A390168 a(n) is the least possible difference between the areas of the largest and smallest rectangles in 5 element set of distinct integer sided rectangles filling an n X n square.
%C A390168 Let the difference between the largest and smallest areas of the rectangles be called the defect. Then a(n) is the minimum defect.
%e A390168 For n = 4, there are two sets of rectangles:
%e A390168   {(1 X 1), (1 X 2), (1 X 3), (1 X 4), (2 X 3)} with defect = 6 - 1 = 5,
%e A390168   {(1 X 1), (1 X 2), (1 X 3), (2 X 2), (2 X 3)} with defect = 6 - 1 = 5.
%e A390168 Therefore a(4) = 5, since this is the minimum defect.
%Y A390168 Column k=5 of A390265.
