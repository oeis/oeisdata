%N A390860 a(n) is the minimum number of armies required for an attacker to have a 50% or better chance of beating a defender with n armies in the game Risk.
%C A390860 In the game Risk, battles are settled by dice roll. Attackers get one red die per army (up to 3 dice) and defenders get one white die per army (up to 2 dice). The highest attacker die is paired with the highest defender die, and 2nd highest with 2nd highest. The attacker must have at least one more army than the number of dice rolled, since one army must be left behind occupying the original attacker space. Ties are won by the defender, which gives defenders a significant advantage. Losing a dice roll corresponds to losing an army, which can change the number of dice that can be rolled.
%C A390860 The defender has a significant advantage when smaller numbers of armies are involved. However, as the number of armies increases, the 3:2 attacker to defender dice ratio increases the likelihood of the attacker winning. Thus, a(n) < k for k >= 19.

%F A390860 a(n) = 1 + min{k : A371949(k, mN) / 7776^(n+k-1) >= 1/2}. - _Sean A. Irvine_, Dec 12 2025
%e A390860 For example, suppose the attacker has 4 armies and is attacking a defender with just 1. The attacker can roll 3 dice against 1 for the defender. Here is a sample battle:
%e A390860           Attacker          Defender
%e A390860 Roll 1:    5 3 2                 6    --> Defender wins and attacker loses one army
%e A390860 Roll 2:    5 1                   4    --> Attacker wins and occupies defender's space
%e A390860 If an attacker with 2 armies attacks a defender with just 1, the attacker loses more than 50% of the time. But with 3 armies, the odds favor the attacker, so a(1) = 3.
%e A390860 Similarly, if a defender has 4 armies then an attacker must have at least 6 armies to have a 50% chance of winning an attack, so a(4) = 6.
