%N A390522 a(n) is the least possible difference between the areas of the largest and smallest trapezoids in a 3 element set of distinct integer-sided trapezoids whose base angles are 60 degrees, that fill an equilateral triangular grid of side n units.
%C A390522 Let the difference between the largest and smallest areas of the trapezoids be called the defect. Then a(n) is the minimum defect. The area of a trapezoid {b X s} is s*(2*b-s).
%e A390522 For n = 6, there is only one set of trapezoids: {{3 X 1}, {4 X 3}, {5 X 2}} with defect = 16 - 5 = 11. Therefore a(6) = 11, since this is the minimum defect.
%Y A390522 Cf. A389392, A389518.
