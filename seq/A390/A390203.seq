%N A390203 Let PG(n) be the graph with one node for each free n-celled polyomino in the {4,5} tessellation of the hyperbolic plane, and edges between nodes corresponding to polyominoes that can be obtained from each other by moving one cell, where the intermediate polyform (the set of cells remaining when the cell to be moved is detached) is required to be a connected polyomino. a(n) is the number of edges in PG(n).
%C A390203 This version of the sequence requires the intermediate polyform to be connected. See link "Excluded example transformation" for an example transformation that is consequently excluded here but included in A390202.
%C A390203 This sequence was calculated in the context of a project in collaboration with Érika Roldán, and Rosemberg Toalá-Enríquez.
