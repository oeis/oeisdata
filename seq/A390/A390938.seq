%N A390938 Number of new keys inserted at iteration n in a map initialized with T[1] := 1, then iterate: for each (key, value) already in T, T[value] := T[value]+key if T[value] already exists, else T[value] := key.
%C A390938 Row lengths of A390939, read as irregular table, which is the main entry for this and related sequences: see there for more information.
%C A390938 Iteration n = 0 corresponds to initialization of the map with one single entry T[1] = 1, hence a(0) = 1.
%C A390938 Eventually, only the 17 entries T[k] with k in A390943 continue growing, roughly or exactly doubling at every or every other iteration. Therefore only these can lead to new entries, and do so, with the exception of T[1] on odd iterations n = 2m+1 and T[32, 134 and 3712] on even iterations n = 2m, where they initially have the same value as in the previous iteration. (All of these four double their value only every other iteration). Thus, a(2m+1) = 16 and a(2m) = 17-3 = 14 for m >= 20.
%F A390938 a(n) = A390937(n) - A390937(n-1) for n > 0.
%F A390938 a(2m) = 14, a(2m+1) = 16, for m >= 20.
%e A390938 a(0) = 1 because T[1] := 1 is the only entry inserted at iteration 0; i.e., when the map is initialized.
%e A390938 a(1) = a(3) = a(5) = 0 because at these iterations, no new entry is inserted. For example, at the first iteration, the only existing entry (key, value) = (1, 1) leads to T[1] := T[1] + 1 = 2, similarly.
%e A390938 a(2) = 1 because at iteration 2, the only existing entry (key, value) = (1, 2) leads to insertion of the new entry T[2] := 1.
%e A390938 Similarly, at iteration 4 and 6, a new entry T[4] := 1 and T[8] := 1, respectively, is inserted.
%e A390938 See the main entry A390939 for more examples and explanations.
