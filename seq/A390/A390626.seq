%N A390626 Numbers k such that the symmetric representation of sigma, SRS(k), and SRS(2k), both considered as lists of the sizes of their parts, have the same number of parts.
%C A390626 SRS(2k) is called a parts-multiple of SRS(k) if there is a number c > 1 such that SRS(2k) = c * SRS(k). SRS(2k) is called an integer parts-multiple of SRS(k) when c is an integer. SRS(k) is called parts-unimodal if every part of SRS(k) is unimodal.
%C A390626 SRS(2k) is a parts-multiple of SRS(k) for every k in this sequence for which SRS(2k) consists of 1 or 2 parts.
%C A390626 The sum of the parts of SRS(k) equals sigma(k) - see the link in A280851 for a proof. Therefore, if SRS(2k) is an integer parts-multiple of SRS(k) for a k in this sequence then k is odd, because for k = 2^m * q with m >= 0 and q odd, sigma(2k) / sigma(k) = (2^(m+2) - 1) / (2^(m+1) - 1) equals 3 when m = 0.
%C A390626 Conjecture: SRS(2k) is a parts-multiple of SRS(k) for every k in this sequence (True for 2k <= 10^6).
%e A390626 Number 5 belongs to the sequence since SRS(10) = { 9, 9 } and SRS(5) = { 3, 3 }. Numbers 10 and 5 have the same width pattern 1 0 1 and SRS(10) is an integer parts-multiple of SRS(5).
%e A390626 Number 9 does not belong to the sequence since SRS(18) = { 39 } and SRS(9) = { 5, 3, 5 }. Note that number 18 belongs to the sequence since SRS(36) = { 91 }.
%e A390626 Number 30 is the smallest number in this sequence for which SRS(60) = { 168 } and SRS(30) = { 72 } have different width patterns; the width pattern of number 60 is 1 2 3 2 3 2 1 and that of number 30 is 1 2 1 2 1 2 1.
%e A390626 Number 32 is in this sequence though SRS(64) = { 127 } is a non-integral parts-multiple of SRS(32) = { 63 }.
%e A390626 Number 2275 is the smallest number in this sequence for which SRS(2275) = { 1138, 1196, 1138 } and SRS(4550) = { 3414, 3588, 3414 } consist of 3 parts and SRS(4550) = 3 * SRS(2275) as lists; however, their central parts have width patterns of maximum width 4 and 2, respectively.
