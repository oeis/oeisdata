%N A390195 a(n) is the number of n-celled treelike polyominoes in the {4,5} tessellation of the hyperbolic plane.
%C A390195 A treelike polyomino has a tree as its connectedness graph (vertices of this graph correspond to cells and two vertices are connected if the corresponding cells have a common edge). It also has maximal perimeter for its size.
%C A390195 This sequence was calculated in the context of a project in collaboration with Érika Roldán, and Rosemberg Toalá-Enríquez.
