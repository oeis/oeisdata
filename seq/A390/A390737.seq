%N A390737 Number of decimal places which are known after using n terms of A084580 and treating them as the coefficients of a continued fraction.
%C A390737 The digits produced by the continued fraction are that of A372869.
%C A390737 Let c(n) be the n-th convergent resulting from A084580.
%C A390737 Further continued fraction terms are taken to be unknown and the worst case (maximum absolute difference) is a single additional 1 and so at worst c(n+1).
%C A390737 a(n) is therefore the length of agreement between c(n) and c(n+1).
%C A390737 It is expected n/a(n) -> A086819 due to Lochs's theorem, but proving that depends on not having runs of consecutive equal terms long enough to push the ratio to some higher constant infinitely often.
%C A390737 Runs of consecutive equal terms occur when c(n) and c(n+1) span a run of 0 digits or 9 digits in A372869 and only several more continued fraction terms can narrow that interval enough to be sure whether 0's or 9's.
