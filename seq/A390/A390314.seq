%N A390314 a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) is the smallest unused number such that the sum a(1) + ... + a(n) is coprime to the product a(1) * ... * a(n).
%C A390314 As the product is always even, all terms beyond a(1) must also be even to ensure that the sum of all terms is odd.
%C A390314 In the first 10000 terms, there are only seven occasions when the sum of the terms is not a prime: these are a(39) = 78, a(48) = 79, a(59) = 122, a(70) = 146, a(204) = 424, a(416) = 830, and a(969) = 1974, where the sum of the terms is 1517, 2279, 3481, 4897, 41567, 172831, and 938177, respectively. It is not known if further nonprime sums appear.
%C A390314 The sequence shares the first 38 terms with A073659. See the examples.

%e A390314 a(5) = 10 as the sum of all terms a(1) to a(5) = 1 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 10 = 19 which is coprime to the product of all terms 1 * 2 * 4 * 6 * 10 = 360.
%e A390314 a(39) = 78 as the sum of all terms a(1) to a(39) = 1 + 2 + ... + 72 + 78 = 1517 = 37 * 41 which is coprime to the product of all terms 1 * 2 * ... * 72 * 78 = 22167...0000 which contains all primes 2 to 31 as distinct prime factors. This is the first term where the sum of all terms is not prime, and the first term to differ from A073659.
