%N A390603 Number of closed binary operations on n labeled elements satisfying (xy)z = xy identically.
%C A390603 The property (xy)z = xy for a binary operation is the action condition for a left projection semigroup (product xy = x) acting as a semigroup on the right on itself as a set. Constants have this property, and the left projection, but not the right projection. All of the right translations must be idempotent functions with the same set of fixed points.
%C A390603 This sequence is R(n, n) where R(m, n) = Sum_{r=1..n} binomial(n,r)*r^((n-r)*m) is the number of right actions of the left projection semigroup of m elements acting on n elements.
%C A390603 The binary operation property that is the action condition for left actions of the left projection on itself as semigroup on set is x(yz) = xz, counted by A279644.
%F A390603 a(n) = Sum_{r=1..n} binomial(n,r)*r^((n-r)*n).
%o A390603 (PARI) a(n) = sum(r=1, n, binomial(n,r)*r^((n-r)*n)); \\ _Michel Marcus_, Nov 12 2025
