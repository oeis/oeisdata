%N A390738 a(n) is the least possible difference between the areas of the largest and smallest trapezoids in a 3 element set of distinct integer-sided trapezoids whose base angles are 60 degrees that fill a regular hexagon of side n units.
%C A390738 A trapezoid whose base angles are 60 degrees with larger base b and legs s is denoted by {b X s} here. The regular hexagon is drawn in an equilateral triangular grid and the area of the trapezoid {b X s} is s*(2*b-s) in unit equilateral triangles.
%C A390738 Let the difference between the largest and smallest area of the trapezoids be called the defect. Then a(n) is the minimum defect.

%e A390738 For n = 5, there are 4 sets of trapezoids
%e A390738   {{10 X 5}, {9 X 4}, {10 X 1}} with defect = 75-19 = 56,
%e A390738   {{10 X 5}, {8 X 3}, {10 X 2}} with defect = 75-36 = 39,
%e A390738   {{10 X 5}, {7 X 2}, {10 X 3}} with defect = 75-51 = 51,
%e A390738   {{10 X 5}, {6 X 1}, {10 X 4}} with defect = 75-11 = 64.
%e A390738 Therefore a(5) = 39, since this is the minimum defect.
%Y A390738 Cf. A390739.
