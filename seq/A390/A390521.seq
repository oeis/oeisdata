%N A390521 a(n) = limiting prime of the recurrence x(k) = 1 + (phi(x(k-1)) + phi(x(k-2))) / 2 started at x(0) = x(1) = n.
%C A390521 a(n) is always prime. a(p) = p for every prime p. The prime number 2 appears just two times (n = 1, 2). For composite n, a(n) is typically a smaller prime; numerics suggest strong bias toward primes p with p-1 having only small factors (notably 2 and 3). For 1 <= n <= 5000, the most frequent limiting primes are: 3 (1057 times), 5 (946), 13 (234), 73 (224), 433 (65), 1153 (52), etc.
%C A390521 The sequence generalizes in two dimensions A039650 ("Prime reached by iterating f(x) = phi(x)+1 on n"), because it could be extended to an infinite two-dimensional matrix T(i,j), so as to start with a generic pair of seeds x(0), x(1) (both greater than 2, to ensure that the result is always integer). In this case, the sequence in question would represent the diagonal T(n,n) of the matrix.

%e A390521 For n = 4, 1+(phi(4)+phi(4))/2 = 1+(2+2)/2 = 3; 1+(phi(3)+phi(4))/2 = 1+(2+2)/2 = 3; 1+(phi(3)+phi(3))/2 = 1+(2+2)/2 = 3, therefore a(4) = 3.
