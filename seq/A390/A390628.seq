%N A390628 Numbers k such that the symmetric representation of sigma, SRS(k), and SRS(2k) have the same width pattern.
%C A390628 This sequence is a subsequence of A390626 since the number of contiguous sections of positive numbers in the width pattern of a number k equals the number of parts of SRS(k).
%C A390628 The terms "parts-multiple", "integer parts-multiple" and "parts-unimodal" are defined in A390626.
%C A390628 Number 30 is the smallest in A390626 that is not in this sequence.
%e A390628 Number 6 is in this sequence since 6 and 12 have the width pattern 1 2 1;
%e A390628 SRS(6) = { 12 } and SRS(12) = { 28 }; number 6 is not in A390627.
%e A390628 Number k = 18 is the smallest k in this sequence for which SRS(18) = { 39 } is not (parts)-unimodal: 1 2 1 2 1.
%e A390628 Number 174 is the smallest k in this sequence for which SRS(k) has 2 parts and maximum width 2; SRS(348) = { 420, 420 } and SRS(174) = { 180, 180 } and their common width pattern is 1 2 1 0 1 2 1 ; number 174 is not in A390627.
%e A390628 Number 35 is the smallest k in this sequence for which SRS(k) has 3 parts and maximum width 2, and since 35 and 70 have the width pattern 1 0 1 2 1 0 1;
%e A390628 SRS(35) = { 18, 12, 18 } and SRS(70) = { 54, 36, 54 } so that number 35 is in A390627.
%e A390628 Number 1001 is the smallest k in this sequence for which SRS(k) has 4 parts and maximum width 3; numbers 2002 and 1001 have the width pattern 1 0 1 2 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 2 1 0 1;
%e A390628 SRS(1001) = { 501, 171, 171, 501 } and SRS(2002) = { 1503, 513, 513, 1503 } so that number 1001 is in A390627.
%e A390628 Number 1314 is the smallest k in this sequence for which SRS(k) = { 3367, 3367 } has 2 parts that are not parts-unimodal: 1 2 1 2 1 0 1 2 1 2 1.
%e A390628 Number 7502 is the smallest k in this sequence for which SRS(7502) = { 5628, 1512, 5628 } has 3 parts with the central part not parts-unimodal: 1 0 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 0 1.
