%N A390119 Reduced endpoint numerators in the construction of the middle-thirds Cantor set, naturally ordered.
%C A390119 Let a_k be the list of 2^(k+1) numerators of the fully reduced rational endpoints of the middle-thirds Cantor set at the k-th stage of construction, where the 0th stage of construction is [0,1], in the order in which the endpoints appear. Let a_k(n) be the n-th entry of the list a_k. Then one can prove that for any j<=k and 1<=n<=2^(j+1), we have a_j(n)=a_k(n). We thus get a well-defined infinite sequence a(n) by letting a(n)=a_k(n) for any k such that n<=2^(k+1). This sequence can be understood as the numerators of endpoints in the construction of the Cantor set in the order that they appear along the interval at the "end" of the construction.
%C A390119 Contains the same terms as A055247 and A113246, but differs in the order and frequency with which they appear.
%C A390119 The terms in list a_{k-1} have total Sum_{i=1..2^k} a(i) = A261399(k).
