%N A390417 Primes at which the prime race among 10k+1, 10k+3, 10k+7, and 10k+9 produces a specific 4-way ranking (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th place in the race) for the first time.
%C A390417 In a prime race between 10k+1, 10k+3, 10k+7, and 10k+9, we keep track of the ranking of all four runners (which ones are in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place) based on the number of primes of each type seen so far.  This sequence gives the prime at which one of the 24 possible "unambiguous" rankings is seen for the first time.  An unambiguous ranking is where all four counts are different.
%C A390417 a(4)-a(19) found by Mike Keith.
%C A390417 The sequence has at most 24 terms, but whether or when the remaining rankings occur is not known.

%e A390417 At a(1) = 53 the counts for (+1, +3, +7, +9) are (3, 5, 4, 2), which are all distinct, so the leaderboard (first to last) is (+3, +7, +1, +9).
