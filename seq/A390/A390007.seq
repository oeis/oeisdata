%N A390007 a(n) is the least possible difference between the areas of the largest and smallest rectangles in a 3 element set of distinct integer sided rectangles filling an n X n square.
%C A390007 Let the difference between the largest and smallest areas of the rectangles be called defect. Then a(n) is the minimum defect.
%C A390007 Conjecture: except for n = 4, there is a unique set of three rectangles corresponding to the minimum defect.
%e A390007 For n = 4, there are three sets of rectangles:
%e A390007   {(1 X 2), (2 X 3), (2 X 4)} with defect = 8 - 2 = 6,
%e A390007   {(1 X 1), (1 X 3), (3 X 4)} with defect = 12 - 1 = 11,
%e A390007   {(1 X 3), (1 X 4), (3 X 3)} with defect = 9 - 3 = 6.
%e A390007 Therefore a(4) = 6, since this is the minimum defect.
%Y A390007 Column k = 3 of A390265.
