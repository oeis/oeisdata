%N A390627 Numbers k such that the symmetric representation of sigma, SRS(k), and SRS(2k), both considered as lists of the sizes of their parts, have the same number of parts and SRS(2k) is an integer parts-multiple of SRS(k).
%C A390627 By definition, this sequence is a subsequence of A390626.
%C A390627 The terms "parts-multiple", "integer parts-multiple" and "parts-unimodal" are defined in A390626.
%C A390627 The sum of the parts of SRS(k) equals sigma(k) - see the link in A280851 for a proof. Therefore, if SRS(2k) is an integer parts-multiple of SRS(k) for a k in this sequence then k is odd, because for k = 2^m * q with m >= 0 and q odd, sigma(2k) / sigma(k) = (2^(m+2) - 1) / (2^(m+1) - 1) equals 3 when m = 0.
%C A390627 Suppose that odd number k has 3 as a divisor. Then the first part of SRS(2k) is greater than 3*(k+1)/2, the length of its first 3 legs, since the 3rd leg has width 2, while the first part of SRS(k) has size (k+1)/2. This contradicts the integral parts-multiplier of 3 for k to be a number in this sequence.
%C A390627 Note that this sequence differs from A390628 first with a(377) = 1309.
%e A390627 Number 5 belongs to the sequence since SRS(10) = { 9, 9 } and SRS(5) = { 3, 3 }; both have width pattern 1 0 1.
%e A390627 Number 25 is the smallest number for which SRS(25) = { 13, 5, 13 } consists of 3 parts. SRS(50) = { 39, 15, 39 } has the integer parts-multiplier of 3 and both 25 and 50 have width pattern 1 0 1 0 1.
%e A390627 Therefore, numbers 5 and 25 also belong to sequence A390628.
%e A390627 Number 1309 = 7 * 11 * 17 is the smallest number k in this sequence for which SRS(2k) and SRS(k) have different width patterns:
%e A390627 SRS(2618) = { 1965, 627, 627, 1965 }; width pattern of 2618: 1 0 1 2 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 2 1 0 1 parts-unimodal
%e A390627 SRS(1309) = { 655, 209, 209, 655 }; width pattern of 1309: 1 0 1 2 1 2 1 0 1 2 1 2 1 0 1 not parts-unimodal
%e A390627 Number 2275 = 5^2 * 7 * 13 is the smallest number k in this sequence for which neither SRS(k) nor SRS(2k) is not parts-unimodal:
%e A390627 SRS(4450): 1 0 1 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 4 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 1 0 1
%e A390627 SRS(2275): 1 0 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 0 1
%e A390627 Therefore, numbers 1309 and 2275 do not belong to sequence A390628.
