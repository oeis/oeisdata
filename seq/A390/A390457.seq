%N A390457 a(1) = 1 thereafter a(n) = floor(k(n)^n) where k(n) = a(1).a(2)a(3)...a(n-1) = 1.111... is the decimal digit concatenation of all preceding terms.
%C A390457 It is conjectured that a(n) = floor(k^n) where k = lim_{n->oo} k(n), which would be a constant k formed from its own powers.
%C A390457 This conjecture fails if some floor(k^n) > floor(k(n)^n) due to k > k(n), but this seems unlikely since arbitrary decimals after k(n) would be a difference k^n - k(n)^n roughly equal to (n+1)*k(n)^n / 10^L(n) where L(n) is the length of k(n) after its decimal point, and that difference is small and rapidly decreasing.
%C A390457 When computing, often a few initial digits of k(n) will suffice to determine a(n); i.e., use a limited precision and watch for when more digits are needed to be certain (up to the full exact k(n)).
%C A390457 This sequence coincides with A094996 for the first 80 terms since k is quite close to 10/9, but differs at n = 81 where here a(81) = 5086.
%e A390457 For n = 2, k(2) = 1 and a(2) = floor(1^2) = 1.
%e A390457 For n = 8, k(8) = a(1).a(2)...a(7) = 1.111112 and a(8) = floor(k(8)^8) = 2.
