%N A390016 Maximum halting time across all Wolfram 3-state 2-symbol Turning machines started with n on the tape.
%C A390016 Only computations which halt are considered.
%C A390016 These maximum times have been checked to 10^8 for n<=20 and at least 10^5 for n>20 (computations longer than that were assumed infinite).
