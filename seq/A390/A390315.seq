%N A390315 Numbers m such that A390254(m) > c*(4/3)^m, where c = lim_{m->oo} A390254(m)/(4/3)^m = A390321.
%C A390315 In general, let {f_n}_{n>=0} be the sequence defined by f_{n+1} = alpha*f_n + e_n, where alpha > 1, a <= e_n <= b, then f_n = (f_0 + e_0/alpha + ... + e_{n-1}/alpha^n)*alpha^n = c*alpha^n - (e_n/alpha + e_{n+1}/alpha^2 + ...), where c = f_0 + Sum_{n>=0} e_n/alpha^{n+1}. Fix a natural number n. For each k >= 0,
%C A390315   (*) -(e_n/alpha + e_{n+1}/alpha^2 + ... + e_{n+k-1}/alpha^k) - (b/(alpha - 1))/alpha^k <= f_n - c*alpha^n <= -(e_n/alpha + e_{n+1}/alpha^2 + ... + e_{n+k-1}/alpha^k) - (a/(alpha - 1))/alpha^k.
%C A390315 As a result:
%C A390315  - If there exists k such that e_n + e_{n+1}/alpha + ... + e_{n+k-1}/alpha^(k-1) > -(a/(alpha - 1))/alpha^(k-1), then f_n < c*alpha^n;
%C A390315  - If there exists k such that e_n + e_{n+1}/alpha + ... + e_{n+k-1}/alpha^(k-1) < -(b/(alpha - 1))/alpha^(k-1), then f_n > c*alpha^n;
%C A390315  - Otherwise we have e_n/alpha + e_{n+1}/alpha^2 + ... = 0, so f_n = c*alpha^n.
%C A390315 Here we have alpha = 4/3, a = -1/3, b = 1/3, and e_n = 0, -1/3, 1/3 for A390254(n) == 0, 1, 2 (mod 3) respectively. Since we have neither e_n = -1/3 for all sufficiently large n nor e_n = 1/3 for all sufficiently large n, the inequalities in (*) are strict. So n is a term in this sequence iff there exists k such that
%C A390315   e_n + (3/4)*e_{n+1} + ... + (3/4)^(k-1)*e_{n+k-1} <= -(3/4)^(k-1).
