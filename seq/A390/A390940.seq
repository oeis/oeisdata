%N A390940 Terms of A390939 sorted in increasing order, where A390939 lists the keys added in the map initialized with T[1] = 1 and repeatedly T[v] := k + (T[v] if defined else 0) for all key-value pairs (k, v) in T.
%C A390940 Only the entries T[k] with k in A390943 grow to infinity, all other entries reach one of the values listed in A390943 and remain constant thereafter. Hence, from a given moment on, the keys added to the table (and listed here) are the { T[k] ; k in A390943 }.
%C A390940 See the main entry A390939 for additional information.
