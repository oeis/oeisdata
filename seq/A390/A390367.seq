%N A390367 The final prime number in the base n sequence when starting from 2 and creating the smallest unused prime number, when read in base n, by either removing or changing or adding a single digit, from 0 to n-1, anywhere in the base n value of the previous number. If the base n sequence does not terminate, a(n) = -1.
%C A390367 On removing the leading digit, any subsequent leading zeros are also removed.
%C A390367 Other known terms are a(13) = 5861, a(14) = 531804751, a(15) = 1036899713, a(16) = 1415645447, a(17) = 717427.
%C A390367 See A390366 for the total length of each base n sequence.
%C A390367 It is conjectured that the sequence of primes in base n terminates for all n.

%e A390367 a(2) = 13 as in base 2 the entire sequence is: 2 = 10_1, 3 = 11_1, 5 = 101_2, 7 = 111_2, 11 = 1011_2, 19 = 10011_2, 17 = 10001_2, 37 = 100101_2, 53 = 110101_2, 29 = 11101_2, 13 = 1101_2, and 13 is the final term as no prime that has not appeared can be created from removing, adding or changing a single digit to 0 or 1 from 1101_2.
