%N A390747 Numbers k such that there is no nonnegative integer sequence whose first sums are the k-th composition in standard order.
%C A390747 The first sums of a nonempty sequence (a, b, c, d, ...) are (a+b, b+c, c+d, ...).
%C A390747 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
%C A390747 Also integers k such that for no b are the b-based partial alternating sums of the k-th composition in standard order all nonnegative.

%e A390747 For n = 24 there are two nonnegative sequences whose first sums are (1,4), namely (0,1,3) and (1,0,4), so 24 is not in the sequence.
%e A390747 For n = 25 there are no nonnegative sequences whose first sums are (1,3,1), so 25 is in the sequence.
%e A390747 For n = 52 there are two nonnegative sequences whose first sums are (1,2,3), namely (0,1,1,2) and (1,0,2,1), so 52 is not in the sequence.
%e A390747 For n = 150, all sequences with first sums (3,2,1,2) are of the form (b,3-b,-1+b,2-b,b) for some b. This is nonnegative for b = 1 or b = 2, so 150 is not in the sequence.
