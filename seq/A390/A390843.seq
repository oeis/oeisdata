%N A390843 5-valuation of Product_{1 <= k <= n} (prime(k) + 1) / (prime(k+1) - prime(k)).
%C A390843 The given product is likely to be an integer for all n, because the cumulated numerators are extremely likely to have more of any given prime factor than the smallish denominators which are the prime gaps. But can it be proved that this is indeed always the case for all prime factors?
%C A390843 The sequence appears to grow slightly sub-linearly: a(10^3) = 188, a(10^4) = 1705, a(10^5) = 15781.

%F A390843 a(n) = A112765(A390839(n)).
%e A390843 The first factors of the product are (2+1)/1 = 3, (3+1)/2 = 2, (5+1)/2 = 3, (7+1)/4 = 2, (11+1)/2 = 6, (13+1)/4 = 7/2, (17+1)/2 = 9, (19+1)/4 = 5, (23+1)/6 = 4, (29+1)/2 = 15, (31+1)/6 = 16/3, ...
%e A390843 Therefore, for the product of the first n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... of these fractions contains a factor of 5 only from prime(n = 8) = 19 on, and second factor of 5 appears with prime(n = 10) = 29.
