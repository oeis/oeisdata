%N A390085 Half the length of the longest irreducible balanced subsets of {-2*n+1, -2*n+3, ..., -3, -1, 1, 3, ..., 2*n-1}.
%C A390085 A zero-sum subset of T(n) is called irreducible if it does not contain any smaller zero-sum subset.
%H A390085 Chinese BBS, <a href="https://bbs.emath.ac.cn/thread-2320-1-1.html">Balanced samples of the initial segment of natural numbers</a> (in Chinese).
%e A390085 For n = 4, a(3) = 2, since the longest irreducible balanced subsets of {-7, -5, -3, -1, 1, 3, 5, 7} are +-{-1, 3, 5, -7}.
%e A390085 For n = 5, a(5) = 2, since total of {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} is odd.
%e A390085 For n = 6, a(6) = 3, since the longest irreducible balanced subsets of {-11, -9, -7, -5, -3, -1, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11} are +-{1, 3, 5, -7, 9, -11}.
%e A390085 For n = 11, a(11) = 4, with one of three pairs of longest irreducible balanced subsets of {-21, -19, ..., 19, 21} being +-{3, 5, 7, -11, 15, -17, 19, -21}.
%Y A390085 Cf. A389802, A389804, A389807, A390083.
