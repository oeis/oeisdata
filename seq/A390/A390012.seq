%N A390012 a(n) is the largest possible smallest nonsquare missed by a union of n squarefree arithmetic progressions.
%C A390012 Subsequence of A000037.
%C A390012 A doubly-infinite integer arithmetic progression (AP) is called "squarefree", if it contains no perfect squares (there is no standard term to denote such an object).
%C A390012 It is easy to prove that the union on n squarefree APs misses infinitely many positive nonsquares. Hence there exists the smallest among them. To find a(n) is to maximize this minimal over all possible choices of n squarefree APs.

%e A390012 Let S(a;b) is the AP n = a mod b. a(5)=28, since, first, 28 is missed by 5 squarefree APs S(2;3), S(2;4), S(3;4), S(3;9), S(2;11), and second any other choice misses a number which is <= 28.
%e A390012 Seven squarefree APs S(2;3), S(2;4), S(3;4), S(2;5), S(3;5), S(5;8), S(8;16) miss all squares, and the smallest nonsquare missed is 60. This provides the lower bound. The upper bound is established by a wide search using the Chinese reminder theorem reduction as one of the tools. So, a(7)=60.
