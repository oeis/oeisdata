%N A390467 Smallest composite member of an arithmetic progression of length k >= 3 where all preceding terms are primes.
%C A390467 The common difference d of the arithmetic progression must necessarily be even. All terms are necessarily odd.
%e A390467 a(1) = 9: The progression is (3, 5, 7) with d = 2. The next term is 7 + 2 = 9, which is composite.
%e A390467 a(2) = 15: The progression is (3, 7, 11) with d = 4. The next term is 11 + 4 = 15, which is composite.
%e A390467 a(3) = 25: The progression is (7, 13, 19) with d = 6. The next term is 19 + 6 = 25, which is composite (5 * 5).
%e A390467 a(6) = 35: The progression is (5, 11, 17, 23, 29) with d = 6. The next term is 29 + 6 = 35, which is composite (5 * 7). Note that 5 * (6 + 1) = 35.
