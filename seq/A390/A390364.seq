%N A390364 Numbers whose prime indices are the first sums minus 1 of some multiset beginning with 1. Sorted list of all Heinz numbers of rows of A390308. Union of A390309.
%C A390364 First differs from A325389 in having 75.
%C A390364 A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798.
%e A390364 The prime indices of 25 are (3,3), which is not the first sums minus 1 of any multiset beginning with 1 (note (2,2,2) does not begin with 1), so 25 is not in the sequence.
%e A390364 The prime indices of 39 are (2,6), which is the first sums minus 1 of (1,2,5), so 39 is in the sequence.
