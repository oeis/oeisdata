%N A390523 a(n) is the least possible difference between the areas of the largest and smallest trapezoids in a 4 element set of distinct integer-sided trapezoids whose base angles are 60 degrees, that fill an equilateral triangular grid of side n units.
%C A390523 Let the difference between the largest and smallest areas of the trapezoids be called the defect. Then a(n) is the minimum defect. The area of a trapezoid {b X s} is s*(2*b-s).
%e A390523 For n = 6, there are 9 sets of trapezoids:
%e A390523   {{2 X 1}, {3 X 1}, {3 X 2}, {6 X 2}} with defect = 20-3 = 17,
%e A390523   {{2 X 1}, {4 X 1}, {6 X 1}, {4 X 3}} with defect = 15-3 = 12,
%e A390523   {{3 X 1}, {3 X 2}, {6 X 1}, {4 X 2}} with defect = 12-5 = 7,
%e A390523   {{2 X 1}, {3 X 1}, {4 X 2}, {5 X 2}} with defect = 16-3 = 13,
%e A390523   {{2 X 1}, {3 X 1}, {4 X 1}, {5 X 3}} with defect = 21-3 = 18,
%e A390523   {{2 X 1}, {3 X 2}, {5 X 1}, {5 X 2}} with defect = 16-3 = 13,
%e A390523   {{3 X 1}, {4 X 1}, {3 X 2}, {5 X 2}} with defect = 16-5 = 11,
%e A390523   {{3 X 1}, {4 X 1}, {5 X 1}, {4 X 3}} with defect = 15-5 = 10,
%e A390523   {{4 X 1}, {3 X 2}, {5 X 1}, {4 X 2}} with defect = 12-7 = 5.
%e A390523 Therefore a(6) = 5, since this is the minimum defect.
