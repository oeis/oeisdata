%N A390550 Smallest b >= 2 for which P_{n}(b) = Sum_{k=1..n} b^(prime(k)-2) is prime or 0 if such a number does not exist.
%C A390550 Polynomials P_{n}(b) are verified irreducible in Z[b] for n <= 149 with the only exception of P_{5}(b) = 1 + b + b^3 + b^5 + b^9 which admits the nontrivial factorization P_{5}(b) = (b^2 - b + 1) * (b^7 + b^6 - b^4 + b^2 + 2*b + 1) over Z[b].
%C A390550 Conjecture: the polynomials P_{n}(b) are irreducible in Z[b] for all but finitely many values of n.
%C A390550 For all but finitely many n there exists a(n) >= 2 such that P_{n}(a(n)) is prime, verified for n <= 200, with the only exceptions being n = 1 and n = 5.

%e A390550 a(5) = 0 in fact P_{5}(b) is reducible over Z[b].
%e A390550 a(6) = 14 in fact P_{6}(b) = 1 + b + b^3 + b^5 + b^9 + b^11. For 2 <= b < 14, P_{6}(b) is composite, while P_{6}(14) = 4070226757031 is prime.
