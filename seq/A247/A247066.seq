%N A247066 Dynamic Betting Game D(n,6,2).
%C A247066 Players A and B bet in a k-round game. Player A has an initial amount of money n. In each round, player A can wager an integer between 0 and what he has. Player A then gains or loses an amount equal to his wager depending on whether player B lets him win or lose. Player B tries to minimize player A's money at the end. The number of rounds player A can lose is r. a(n) is the maximum amount of money player A can have at the end of the game for k = 6 and r = 2.

%e A247066 In the case of n=6: For the first round, player A bets 2. Player B will let player A win. Otherwise player A will end up with D(4,5,1)=17 per reference A247061. Therefore after the first round, player A has 8 and will end up with D(8,5,2)=16 per reference A247062. Alternatively, player A bets 3 for the first round. Player B will let player A lose. Otherwise player A will end up with D(9,5,2)=17 per reference A247062. Therefore after the first round, player A has 3 and will end up with D(3,5,1)=16 per reference A247061. If A does not follow the proposed bets, he will have fewer than 16 at the end. So a(6) = 16.
