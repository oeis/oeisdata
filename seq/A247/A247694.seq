%N A247694 Minimal absolute discriminants a(n) of complex quadratic fields with 3-class group of type (3,3), 3-principalization type H.4 (2122), second 3-class group G of even nilpotency class cl(G)=2(n+3), and 3-class tower of unknown length at least 3.
%C A247694 The 3-principalization type (transfer kernel type, TKT) H.4 (2122) is not a permutation, contains a transposition, and has no fixed point.
%C A247694 The nilpotency condition cl(G)=2n+6 for the second 3-class group is equivalent to a transfer target type, TTT (called IPAD by Boston, Bush and Hajir) of the shape [(3^{n+2},3^{n+3}),(3,3,3),(3,9)^2].
%C A247694 The second 3-class group G is one of two vertices of depth 2 on the coclass tree with root SmallGroup(243,6) contained in the coclass graph G(3,2).
%C A247694 The length of the Hilbert 3-class field tower of all these fields is completely unknown. Therefore, these discriminants are among the foremost challenges of future research, similarly as those of A242873, A247688, A247697.
%C A247694 A247694 is an extremely sparse subsequence of A242878 and it is exceedingly hard to compute a(n) for n>0.
%C A247694 The initial term a(0)=21668 has been recognized as a realization of TKT H.4 in the Dissertation of J. R. Brink(1984). However, Brink did not know that the TKT H.4 can also occur with second 3-class group G=SmallGroup(729,45) of nilpotency class cl(G)=4 and TTT [(3,3,3)^3,(3,9)]. Actually, D. C. Mayer (1991) was the first who proved that the integer 21668 is the smallest term of A247694 and does not belong to A242873.
