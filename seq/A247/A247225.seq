%C A247225 Conjecturally the sequence is a permutation of the positive integers. However, to prove this we need more subtle arguments than were used to prove the corresponding property for A098550. - _Vladimir Shevelev_, Jan 14 2015
%C A247225 For n <= 2000, a(3n-1) is even and both a(3n) and a(3n-2) are odd numbers. I conjecture that this is true for all positive integers n. This conjecture is true iff for all positive integers n, a(3n-1) is even. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Jan 14 2015
%C A247225 From _Vladimir Shevelev_, Jan 19 2015:  (Start)
%C A247225 A generalization of A098550 and A247225.
%C A247225 Let p_n=prime(n). Define the following sequence
%C A247225 a(1)=1, a(2)=p_1,...,a(k+2)=p_(k+1), otherwise the smallest number not occurring earlier having at least one common factor with a(n-(k+1)), but none with a(n-1)*a(n-2)*...*a(n-k).
%C A247225 The sequence begins
%C A247225 1, p_1, p_2, ..., p_(k+1), p_1^2, p_2^2, ..., p_(k+1)^2, p_1^3, ... (*)
%C A247225 [ p_1^3 is followed by p_2*p_(k+2), k<=2,
%C A247225 p_2^3, k>=3, etc.]
%C A247225 In particular, if k=1, it is A098550, if k=2, it is A247225.
%C A247225 Conjecturally for every k>=2, as in the case k=1, the sequence (*) is a permutation of the positive integers. For k>=3, at first glance, already the appearance of the number 6 seems problematic. However, at the author's request, _Peter J. C. Moses_ found that the positions of 6 are 83, 157, 1190, 206, ... in cases k=3,4,5,6,... respectively (A254003).
%C A247225 Note also that for every k>=2, every even term is followed by k odd terms. This is explained by the minimal growth of even numbers (2n) relatively with one of the numbers with the smallest prime divisor p>=3 (asymptotically 6n, 15n, 105n/4, 385n/8, ... for p = 3,5,7,11,... respectively (cf. A084967 - A084970)).
