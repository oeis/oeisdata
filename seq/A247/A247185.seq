%N A247185 a(0) = 0. a(n) is the number of repeating sums in the collection of all sums of two elements in [a(0), ... a(n-1)], chosen without replacement.
%C A247185 Without replacement means that a(i)+a(i) is not a valid sum to include. However, if a(i) = a(j), a(i)+a(j) is still a valid sum to include because they have different indices.
%C A247185 a(i)+a(j) and a(j)+a(i) are regarded as the same sum for all indices i and j.
%C A247185 a(n) <= A000217(n)-n.
%e A247185 a(1) gives the number of repeating sums in the collection of all possible sums of two elements in [0]. There are no sums between two elements here, so a(1) = 0.
%e A247185 a(2) gives the number of repeating sums in the collection of all possible sums of two elements in [0,0]. There is only one sum, 0, thus there are no repeats. So a(2) = 0.
%e A247185 a(3) gives the number of repeating sums in the collection of all possible sums of two elements in [0,0,0]. The possible sums are 0+0, 0+0, or 0+0, thus there are two repeats. So a(3) = 2.
%e A247185 a(4) gives the number of repeating sums in the collection of all possible sums of two elements in [0,0,0,2]. The possible sums are 0+0, 0+0, 0+2, 0+0, 0+2, and 0+2. There are 4 repeating sums (2 extra zeros and 2 extra twos). So a(4) = 4.
