%N A247334 Highly abundant numbers which are not abundant.
%C A247334 A number n is called "abundant" if sigma(n) > 2n, and "highly abundant" if sigma(n) > sigma(m) for all m < n. With these definitions, it's possible for a number to be highly abundant but not abundant. (A similar situation occurs with 2 being prime and highly composite.)
%C A247334 Fischer shows that all highly abundant numbers greater than 20 are multiples of 6. Since 6 is perfect and multiples of perfect numbers are abundant, this list is finite and complete.

%e A247334 10 is in the sequence because sigma(10) > sigma(m) for m = 1 to 9, yet sigma(10) = 17 < 20.
