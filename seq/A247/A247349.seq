%N A247349 Regular triangle obtained by procedure described in comment in the case of m=3.
%C A247349 "Consider an array of numbers formed by a rotating queue: starting with just the number 1, to obtain the next row we move everything in the last row m steps to the left, with numbers at the front of the row cycling around and appearing at the back. We then append 1 plus the head of the last row to the new row." (from the Introduction of article by P. J. Graber).
