%N A247063 Dynamic Betting Game D(n,5,3).
%C A247063 Players A and B bet in a k-round game. Player A has an initial amount of money n. In each round, player A can wager an integer between 0 and what he has. Player A then gains or loses an amount equal to his wager depending on whether player B lets him win or lose. Player B tries to minimize player A's money at the end. The number of rounds player A can lose is r. a(n) is the maximum amount of money player A can have at the end of the game for k = 5 and r = 3.

%e A247063 In the case of n=7: For the 1st round, player A bets 1. If A loses, A will end up with D(6,4,2)=8 per reference A247161. If A wins, he has 8 and will end up with D(8,4,3)=8 per reference A247160. If A does not follow the proposed bet, he will have fewer than 8 at the end. So a(7) = 8.
