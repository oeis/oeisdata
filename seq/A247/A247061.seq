%N A247061 Dynamic Betting Game D(n,5,1).
%C A247061 Players A and B bet in a k-round game. Player A has an initial amount of money n. In each round, player A can wager an integer between 0 and what he has. Player A then gains or loses an amount equal to his wager depending on whether player B lets him win or lose. Player B tries to minimize player A's money at the end. The number of rounds player A can lose is r. a(n) is the maximum amount of money player A can have at the end of the game for k = 5 and r = 1.

%e A247061 In the case of n=3: For the 1st round, player A bets 2. If A loses, A will end up with 16 by betting all he has for the last 4 rounds. If A wins, he has 5 and will end up with D(5,4,1)=16 per reference A247060. If A does not follow the proposed bet, he will have fewer than 16 at the end. So a(3) = 16.
