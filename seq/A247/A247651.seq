%N A247651 Maximum number of binary strings of length 2n obtained from a partition of n.
%C A247651 The number of different binary strings of length 2n that can be constructed with an equal number (n) of 0's and 1's, based on a given partition of the 0's (or 1's) into uninterrupted runs, can be written as Nseq(n,partition)=(n+1)!/(Prod_j(m_j!)(n-m+1)!) where m is the number of partition members (total number of runs of 0's or 1's); and m_j is the multiplicity of runs of length j of 0's (or 1's) (j=positive integer).
%C A247651 The numbers satisfy the relations Sum_j(m_j)=m, Sum_j(j*m_j)=n.
%C A247651 Prod_j(m_j!)(n-m+1)! becomes n! at the extremes (finest partition of n, m=n -- coarsest partition of n, m=1). Nseq (n,partition) is in that sense a relative measure of the complexity of the partition and the associated binary strings. a(n) is the number of strings obtained based on the partition of n that maximizes Nseq(n,partition).
%F A247651 a(n) = (n+1)*A130760(n).
%F A247651 a(n) = Max[(n+1)!/(Prod_j(m_j!)(n-m+1)!)] over all partitions of n.
%e A247651 n=0 gives the empty string.
%e A247651 n=1 and the only possible partition generate 01 and 10.
%e A247651 For n=2, both possible partitions generate 3 strings (0011,0110 and 1100, and respectively 0101, 1001 and 1010, based on runs of 1's).
%e A247651 For n=3, the optimal partition is {1,2}, generating 12 strings (based on runs of 1's: 001011, 001101, 010011, 010110, 011001, 011010, 100011, 100110, 101100, 110001, 110010, 110100).
