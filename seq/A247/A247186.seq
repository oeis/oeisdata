%N A247186 a(0) = 0. a(n) is the number of repeating sums in the collection of all sums formed from [a(0), ... a(n-1)] + [a(0), ... a(n-1)].
%C A247186 This is different from A247185 since here, a(i)+a(i) is included as a valid sum.
%C A247186 a(i)+a(j) and a(j)+a(i) are regarded as the same sum for all indices i and j.
%C A247186 a(n) <= A000217(n).
%e A247186 a(1) is the number of repeating sums in the collection of all possible sums of [0] + [0]. There is only one possible sum here, 0+0. There are no repeats, so a(1) = 0.
%e A247186 a(2) is the number of repeating sums in the collection of all possible sums of [0,0] + [0,0]. The possible sums are 0+0, 0+0, and 0+0 (first+first, first+second, and second+second). There are two repeats, so a(2) = 2.
%e A247186 a(3) is the number of repeating sums in the collection of all possible sums of [0,0,2] + [0,0,2]. The possible sums are 0+0, 0+0, 0+2, 0+0, 0+2, and 2+2. There are 3 repeats, so a(3) = 3.
%e A247186 a(4) is the number of repeating sums in the collection of all possible sums of [0,0,2,3] + [0,0,2,3]. The possible sums are 0+0, 0+0, 0+2, 0+3, 0+0, 0+2, 0+3, 2+2, 2+3, and 3+3. There are 4 repeats, so a(4) = 4.
