%N A247627 Knife numbers (fourth version): n=concat(a,b) is divisible by a+b; a>0 and b may be zero but not have leading zeros.
%C A247627 Sequence A247624 is a subsequence, and A247626 contains this as a subsequence, while A247625 is a different variant (with the same inclusion properties).

%e A247627 All n = 10k = concat(k,0) are in this sequence, because k+0 divides n.
%e A247627 However, e.g., 102 is not included since the decomposition in 1+02 is not allowed (and 10+2 does not divide 102).
