%N A072141 Numbers n such that two applications of 'Reverse and Subtract' lead to n, whereas one application does not lead to n.
%C A072141 There are two four-digit terms in the sequence. Further terms are obtained (a) by inserting at the center of these terms any number of 9's and (b) by concatenating a term any number of times with itself and inserting an equal number of 0's at all junctures. Method (b) may be applied recursively to all terms. - Revised thanks to a comment from _Hans Havermann_, Jan 27 2004.
%C A072141 Solutions to x = f^k(x), x <> f^j(x) for j < k, where f: n -> |n - reverse(n)|, for period lengths k <= 22 are given by:

%C A072141 I still have no answer to the question if there exist solutions for other values of k. Random tests for larger n (up to 50 digits) have shown that periods 1 and 2 are very frequent (> 90 %), period 14 is not unusual (7 to 8 %), periods 22, 12 and 17 are very rare and other periods did not appear.
%C A072141 I conjecture that for some k there are no solutions, while in other cases the minimal solutions will have 20, 24, 28, ... digits (which however are very hard to find).
