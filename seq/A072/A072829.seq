%N A072829 Greatest m such that Product_{k=1..n-1} (1 - k/m) <= 1/2.
%C A072829 Among n randomly selected dates over an interval of m days (or less), the odds are even (or better than even) for two or more of them to coincide.
%C A072829 Halley's Comet appeared in exactly one year between each of the last 9 given entries of this sequence, i.e. a(45) to a(53). - _David Terr_, Jan 03 2005
%F A072829 Corresponds to the ultimate occurrence of n in A033810. For large n, m has magnitude n^2/2ln2.
%e A072829 Thus a(7)=32 for instance implies that among 7 persons bearing the same astrological sign(extending over 30 days or so) the odds are trifle better than even for at least two of them further sharing a common birthday.
%t A072829 f[n_] := (k = 1; While[ Product[1 - i/k, {i, 1, (n - 1)}] <= 1/2, k++ ]; Return[k - 1]); Table[ f[n], {n, 2, 53}]
