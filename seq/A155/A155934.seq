%N A155934 a(n) denotes the least integer such that every n X n {0,1}-matrix with exactly a(n) ones in each row and in each column contains a 2 X 2 submatrix without zeros. (This sequence is referred to as k(m) in A003509 and A005991.)
%C A155934 Original definition: The sequence {k(m)} defined in A005991.

%e A155934 From _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 06 2025: (Start)
%e A155934 For n = 2, we consider 2 X 2 matrices, which can have a 2 X 2 submatrix without any zero only if all a(n) = 2 elements in each row and column are nonzero.
%e A155934 Similarly, any 3 X 3 matrix with only 2 (or less) nonzero elements in each row and column will have a zero in any 2 X 2 submatrix: Deleting one row and one column will remove at most two zeros, and at least one zero will remain. Therefore a(3) = 3.
%e A155934 For 4 X 4 matrices, it is sufficient to have exactly 3 nonzero elements in each row and column in order to have a 2 X 2 submatrix without zeros: That way, there is a single zero in each row and column (exchanging zeros and ones, we'd have a permutation matrix), and one can always extract a nonzero 2 X 2 submatrix. For example, when the zeros are on the diagonal, one can take the upper right 2 X 2 block A[1..2, 3..4]. Hence a(4) = 3. (End)
