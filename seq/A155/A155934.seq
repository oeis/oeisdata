%N A155934 a(n) denotes the least nonnegative integer such that every n X n {0,1}-matrix with exactly a(n) ones in each row and in each column contains a 2 X 2 submatrix without zeros. (This sequence is referred to as k(m) in A003509 and A005991.)
%C A155934 Original definition: The sequence {k(m)} defined in A005991.
%C A155934 All known terms (n=2 to n=43) agree with A368941(n). - _Eric W. Weisstein_, Apr 16 2019 and Jan 10 2024

%C A155934 The sequence could be defined for index n = 1, with a(1) = 2. No 1 X 1 matrix with exactly 0 or 1 ones per row (namely, the matrices [0] and [1]) can't contain a 2 X 2 submatrix. However, since there is no 1 X 1 matrix with exactly 2 ones in each row, every such matrix does contains a 2 X 2 submatrix without zeros. So a(1) = 2 is the least positive integer with the required property.
%C A155934 The restriction to nonnegative integers is necessary in the definition, since otherwise any negative integer would make the statement true: for example, every n X n matrix with -1 ones in each row contains such a 2 X 2 submatrix, because there is no such n X n matrix. Thus, the integer could be chosen arbitrarily close to -oo, and no term of this sequence would be well defined. (End)

%e A155934 For n = 2, we consider 2 X 2 matrices, which can have a 2 X 2 submatrix without any zero only if all a(n) = 2 elements in each row and column are nonzero.
%e A155934 Similarly, any 3 X 3 matrix with only 2 (or less) nonzero elements in each row and column will have a zero in any 2 X 2 submatrix: Deleting one row and one column will remove at most two zeros, and at least one zero will remain. Therefore a(3) = 3.
%e A155934 For 4 X 4 matrices, it is sufficient to have exactly 3 nonzero elements in each row and column in order to have a 2 X 2 submatrix without zeros: That way, there is a single zero in each row and column (exchanging zeros and ones, we'd have a permutation matrix), and one can always extract a nonzero 2 X 2 submatrix. For example, when the zeros are on the diagonal, one can take the upper right 2 X 2 block A[1..2, 3..4]. Hence a(4) = 3.
%e A155934 For 5 X 5 matrices, it is also sufficient to have exactly 3 nonzero elements in each row and column. Indeed, choose the two columns having a zero in row 1; both of them have one more zero in another row. Thus, there remain at least two rows in which these columns have no zero, which provides the required 2 X 2 submatrix.
