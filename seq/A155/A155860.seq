%N A155860 Number of ways to write 2n-1 as p + 2^x + 3*2^y with p an odd prime and x,y positive integers.
%C A155860 On Jan 21 2009, _Zhi-Wei Sun_ conjectured that a(n)>0 for n=6,7,...; in other words, any odd integer m>10 can be written as the sum of an odd prime, a positive power of 2 and three times a positive power of 2. Sun verified this for odd integers m<10^7. On Sun's request, Qing-Hu Hou and _Charles R Greathouse IV_ continued the verification for odd integers below 2*10^8 and 10^10 respectively and found no counterexamples.
%C A155860 As 3*2^y = 2^y + 2^{y+1}, Sun's conjecture implies that each odd integer m>8 can be written as the sum of an odd prime and three positive powers of two. Note that Paul Erdős asked whether there is a positive integer r such that every odd integer m>3 can be written as the sum of a prime and at most r powers of 2.
%C A155860 _Zhi-Wei Sun_ also raised the following problem: For k=3,5,...,61 determine whether any odd integer m>2k+3 can be written in the form p + 2^x + k*2^y with p an odd prime and x,y positive integers. Sun observed that 353 is not of the form p + 2^x + 51*2^y and Qing-Hu Hou continued the search for m<2.5*10^7 and found that 22537515 is not of the form p + 2^x + 47*2^y. For k=3,5,...,45,49,53,55,...,61, Sun has checked odd integers below 10^8 and found no odd integer m>2k-3 not of the form p + 2^x + k*2^y.
