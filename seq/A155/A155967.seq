%N A155967 Binary transpose primes. Integers of k^2 bits which, when written row by row as a square matrix and then read column by column, are primes once transformed.
%C A155967 Note that composites can also be self-dual under this bitwise transpose transformation; i.e., 283 (base 10) = 100011011 (base 2) whose row-by-row matrix is [100,011,011] which is invariant under the transpose. Hence the basic sequence can be called "primes which are fixed points under binary matrix transpose." What are some nontrivial solutions base 10? Base k for other k?
%C A155967 The primes which stay fixed under the transpositions are 257, 283, 433, 443, 32801, 33029, 33377, 33623, 33637, 33811, 34369, 34679, ... - _R. J. Mathar_, Feb 06 2009
%e A155967 a(1) = 11 because 11 (base 2) = 1011. Write the matrix whose row-by-row is [10,11], read by columns to get 1101 and since 1101 (base 2) = 13, which is prime. Note that such numbers are either self-dual or have a distinct dual, so a(2) = 13. a(3) = 257 because 257 (base 2) = 100000001, whose bit-transpose is itself (a self-dual binary prime). a(4) = 271 because 271 (base 2) = 100001111, which is by rows [100,001,111], which when read by columns is 101001011 and that (base 2) is 331, a prime and the dual, equal to a(9).
