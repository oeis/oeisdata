%N A155904 Number of ways to write 2n-1 as p+2^x+5*2^y with p an odd prime and x,y positive integers.
%C A155904 On Jan 21 2009, _Zhi-Wei Sun_ conjectured that a(n)>0 for n=8,9,...; in other words, any odd integer m>=15 can be written as the sum of an odd prime, a positive power of 2 and five times a positive power of 2. Sun has verified this for odd integers m<10^8. As 5*2^y=2^y+2^{y+2}, the conjecture implies that each odd integer m>8 can be written as the sum of an odd prime and three positive powers of two. [It is known that there are infinitely many positive odd integers not of the form p+2^x+2^y (R. Crocker, 1971).] Sun also conjectured that there are infinitely many positive integers n with a(n)=a(n+1); here is the list of such positive integers n: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 19, 24, 36, 54, 60, 75, 90, 98, 101, 105, 135, 153, 173, ...
