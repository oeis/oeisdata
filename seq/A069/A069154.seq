%N A069154 Treated as strings, the concatenation c of the prime factors of n, in increasing order, is an initial segment of n. Equivalently, n begins with c.
%C A069154 All terms listed above have at most three prime factors. Is there an upper bound to the number of prime factors of terms of this sequence?
%C A069154 Called "enlightened numbers" by J. Pe. Note that the Mathematica program he provides in his web page erroneously recognizes some numbers as members of the sequence, for example 2239488. The smallest member with 4 prime factors is 2377970784 = 2^5*3^5*7^2*79^2. - _Giovanni Resta_, Apr 01 2013

%e A069154 The prime factors of 119911 are 11 and 991, which when concatenated yield 11991, an initial segment of 119911. Therefore 119911 is a term of the sequence.
