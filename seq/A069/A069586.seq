%N A069586 Smallest prime power p^k (k >= 2) such that there is a difference of exactly n between p^k and some other prime power q^m (m >= 2); or 0 if no such q^m exists.
%C A069586 Any solution for the terms that are currently zero is > 10^14. Since there are so many 'missing' values, I would recommend leaving the more keyword. - Larry Reeves (larryr(AT)acm.org), Jul 02 2002
