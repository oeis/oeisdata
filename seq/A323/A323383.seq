%N A323383 Proper divisors of 24.
%C A323383 These are the only 7 positive integers k which meet the constraint tau(k) >= k/2, where tau(k) = A000005(k). Inductively, there can only be a finite number of integers which meet this constraint. 1 has a perfect tau(k) / k ratio at 1. Every time a j-th power of a prime is multiplied by it, its ratio is multiplied by (j + 1)/p^j. Although 2 also achieves a perfect score, the scores must degrade after 2 because the above ratio is less than 1 otherwise.
%e A323383 tau(1) = 1 >= 0.5
%e A323383 tau(2) = 2 >= 1
%e A323383 tau(3) = 2 >= 1.5
%e A323383 tau(4) = 3 >= 2
%e A323383 so 1, 2, 3, 4 are in the sequence.
%e A323383 tau(5) = 2 < 2.5
%e A323383 so 5 is not in the sequence.
