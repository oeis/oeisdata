%N A323650 Flower garden sequence (see Comments for precise definition).
%C A323650 This arises from a hybrid cellular automaton on a triangular grid formed of I-toothpicks and V-toothpicks. Also, it appears that this is a missing link between A147562 (Ulam-Warburton) and three toothpick sequences: A139250 (normal toothpicks), A161206 (V-toothpicks) and A160120 (Y-toothpicks). The behavior resembles the toothpick sequence A139250, on the other hand, the formulas are directly related to A147562. Plot 2 shows that the graph is located between the graph of A139250 and the graph of A147562.
%C A323650 For the construction of the sequence the rules are as follows:
%C A323650 On the infinite triangular grid at stage 0 there are no toothpicks, so a(0) = 0.
%C A323650 At stage 1 we place an I-toothpick formed of two single toothpicks in vertical position, so a(1) = 1.
%C A323650 For the next n generation we have that:
%C A323650 If n is even then at every free end of the structure we add a V-toothpick formed of two single toothpicks such that the angle of each single toothpick with respect to the connected I-toothpick is 120 degrees.
%C A323650 If n is odd then we add I-toothpicks in vertical position (see the example).
%C A323650 a(n) gives the total number of I-toothpicks and V-toothpicks in the structure after the n-th stage.
%C A323650 A323651 (the first differences) gives the number of elements added at the n-th stage.
%C A323650 Note that 2*a(n) gives the total number of single toothpicks of length 1 after the n-th stage.
%C A323650 The structure contains only three kinds of polygonal regions as follows:
%C A323650 - Rhombuses that contain two triangular cells.
%C A323650 - Regular hexagons that contain six triangular cells.
%C A323650 - Oblong hexagons that contain 10 triangular cells.
%C A323650 The structure looks like a "garden of flowers with six petals" (between other substructures). In particular, after 2^(n+1) stages with n >= 0, the structure looks like a flower garden in a rectangular box which contains A002450(n) flowers with six petals.
%C A323650 Note that this hybrid cellular automaton is also a superstructure of the Ulam-Warburton cellular automaton (at least in four ways). The explanation is as follows:
%C A323650 1) A147562(n) equals the total number of I-toothpicks in the structure after 2*n - 1 stage, n >= 1.
%C A323650 2) A147562(n) equals the total number of pairs of Y-toothpicks connected by their endpoints in the structure after 2*n stage (see the example).
%C A323650 3) A147562(n) equals the total number of "flowers with six petals" (or six-pointed stars formed of six rhombuses) in the structure after 4*n stage. Note that the location of the "flowers with six petals" in the structure is essentially the same as the location of the "ON" cells in the version "one-step bishop" of A147562.
%C A323650 4) For more connections to A147562 see the Formula section.
%C A323650 The "word" of this cellular automaton is "ab". For more information about the word of cellular automata see A296612.
%C A323650 The total number of "flowers with six petals" after n-th stage equals the total number of "hidden crosses" after n-th stage in the toothpick structure of A139250, including the central cross (beginning to count the crosses when their "nuclei" are totally formed with 4 quadrilaterals). - _Omar E. Pol_, Mar 06 2019
%C A323650 The graph is very close to the graph from A390468 (see the Plot 2 in the Links section). - _Omar E. Pol_, Dec 12 2025
