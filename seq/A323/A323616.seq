%N A323616 a(n) is the largest prime factor of phi(2^n-1), where phi is Euler's totient.
%C A323616 If a(n) <= 2, then a regular (2^n-1)-gon can be constructed using a straightedge and compass; if a(n) <= 3, then a regular (2^n-1)-gon can be constructed using a straightedge, compass and an angle-trisector, etc.
%C A323616 It appears that each value occurs only a few times (see the Example section below), but to prove this seems nearly impossible.
%C A323616 Although a(n) = gpf(n) for the first few n, it should more often be the case that a(n) is relatively large compared to n. It seems that gpf(phi(2^n-1)) = gpf(n) only for n = 1..16, 18, 20, 21, 25, 26, 28, 29, 32, 36, 50. See the Example section below.
%C A323616 Nevertheless, there are many n such that a(n) = a(2*n) (including 44 of the first 100 terms). Moreover, if phi(2^n-1) and phi(2^n+1) have exactly the same prime factors, then phi(2^(2*n)-1) = phi(2^n-1)*phi(2^n+1) is powerful, and this holds for 2*n = 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 16, 18, 26, 32, 36, 38, 50, 60, 62, 76, 108, 122, 254. By the way, phi(2^n-1) is also powerful for n = 9, 11, 15, 21, 25, 28, and there seem to be no other such numbers n.
