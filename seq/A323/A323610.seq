%N A323610 List of 5-powerful numbers (for the definition of k-powerful see A323395).
%C A323610 The sequence consists of the multiples of 8 that are greater than or equal to 64, together with 48. The result is due to D. Boyd, Berend, and Golan. It had been conjectured that the sequence began with 64, but Boyd discovered the set
%C A323610 {1,2,7,10,11,12,13,14,16,17,21,22,27,28,32,33,35,36,37,38,39,42,47,48},
%C A323610 which shows that 48 is 5-powerful.
