%N A323939 Number of unbranched tri-4-catafusenes under the symmetry point group C_{2v} as a function of the number of hexagons (see Cyvin et al. (1996) for precise definition).
%C A323939 From _Petros Hadjicostas_, May 25 2019: (Start)
%C A323939 According to the Schoenflies notation used in Chemistry, the point group C_{2v} is the cyclic group C_2 "with the addition of" 2 "mirror planes containing the axis of rotation (vertical planes)" (see the Wikipedia article about the Schoenflies notation).
%C A323939 According to the Wikipedia article about Molecular symmetry, a simple description of typical geometry of this group is "angular (H2O) or see-saw (SF4)" (where SF4 = sulfur tetrafluoride).
%C A323939 According to Cyvin et al. (1996, p. 496), a catafusene is a "simply connected catacondensed polyhex". "It is a system consisting of congruent regular hexagons, where any two hexagons either share exactly one edge or are disjointed". "A tri-4-catafusene is generated by contraction of exactly three of its hexagons to tetragons" (see p. 499).
%C A323939 In general (see p. 496), "any alpha-q-catafusene (q = 3-5) can be generated from a catafusene on converting alpha of its hexagons to q-gons by contraction". Here, obviously, alpha = 3 and q = 4.
%C A323939 Here, a(n) is the number of (non-equivalent) unbranched tri-4-catafusenes under the symmetry point group C_{2v}, where n = number of polygons (also known as "rings") in the unbranched tri-4-catafusenes. (Hence, n - 3 is the total number of the remaining hexagons since 3 of the original hexagons became tetragons.) In the paper, the letter r is used to denote the number of polygons rather than the letter n (see p. 496).
%C A323939 The numbers (a(n): n >= 3) = (a(r): r >= 3) appear in Table 1 on p. 500 of Cyvin et al. (1996) under the point group C_{2v}.
%C A323939 In the paper, a(n) is denoted by M_r (p. 500) and is called the total number of "mirror-symmetrical (C_{2v}) systems" (here r = n). It is decomposed into the sum C_r + L_r, where C_r is the number of "centrosymmetrical (C_{2h}) systems" (p. 499) and L_r = (1/2)*binomial(r, 3) - (1/8)*(1-(-1)^r)*(r-1) (see Eq. (15) on p. 499). The numbers L_r count some kind of symmetry described on p. 499 of the paper, but it is unclear what they exactly count.
%C A323939 The point group C_{2h} mentioned above (with the centrosymmetrical systems) is the cyclic group C_2 "with the addition of a mirror (reflection) plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation (horizontal plane)" (see the Wikipedia articles about Molecular symmetry and the Schoenflies notation).
%C A323939 Unfortunately, the letter C is used for two different purposes in the paper: to denote various point groups in three dimensions and to denote the number of non-equivalent systems of contracted catafusenes under some kind of symmetry.
%C A323939 The numbers (C_r: r >= 0), which apparently appear in Table 1 (p. 500) under the point group C_{2h} (see above), satisfy C_{2*i} = 0 and C_{2*i+3} = (1/2)*Sum_{1 <= j <= i} j*a_{i+1,j} (see Eq. (17), p. 500), where the double array a_{i,j} appears on p. 498 (Section 5) of the paper. We have a_{i,j} = binomial(i-1, j-1)*2^(i-j) = A038207(i-1, j-1) for i, j >= 1 (see Eq. (32), p. 502 in the paper).
%C A323939 Putting the above information together, we can easily prove the formulas for a(n) that appear below in the FORMULA section.
%C A323939 Note that the notation for the current sequence a(n) should not be confused with the double array a_{i,j} defined on p. 498 of the paper.
