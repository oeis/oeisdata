%C A323653 Conjecture 1 (a): This sequence consists of those m for which sigma(m)/m is an integer (thus a term of A007691), and coprime with m. Or expressed in a slightly weaker form (b): {1} followed by those m for which sigma(m)/m is an integer, but not a divisor of m. In a slightly stronger form (c): For m > 1, sigma(m)/m is always the least prime not dividing m. This would imply both (a) and (b) forms.
%C A323653 Conjecture 2: This sequence is finite.
%C A323653 Conjecture 3: This sequence is the intersection of A007691 and A351458.
%C A323653 Conjecture 4: This is a subsequence of A349745, thus also of A351551 and of A351554.
%C A323653 Note that if there existed an odd perfect number x that were not a multiple of 3, then both x and 2*x would be terms in this sequence, as then we would have: sigma(x)/x = 2, sigma(2*x)/(2*x) = 3, sigma(6*x)/(6*x) = 4. See also the diagram in A347392 and A353365.

%C A323653 Apparently for all n > 1, A336546(a(n)) = 0. [At least for n=2..23], while A353633(a(n)) = 1, for n=1..23.
%C A323653 The terms a(1) .. a(23) are only cases present among the 5721 known and claimed multiperfect numbers with abundancy <> 2, as published 03 January 2022 under Flammenkamp's site, that satisfy the condition for inclusion in this sequence.
%C A323653 They are also the only 23 cases among that data such that gcd(n, sigma(n)/n) = 1, or in other words, for which the n and its abundancy are relatively prime, with abundancy in all cases being the least prime that does not divide n, A053669(n), which is a sufficient condition for inclusion in A351458.
