%N A323831 a(0) = 5; thereafter a(n) is obtained by doubling a(n-1) and repeatedly deleting any string of identical digits.
%C A323831 Periodic with period length 20.
%C A323831 Conjecture: If we start with any nonnegative number, and repeatedly double it and apply the "repeatedly delete any run of identical digits" operation described here, we eventually reach one of 0, 1, or 5.
%C A323831 In other words, the conjecture is that eventually we reach 0 or join the trajectory shown here or the trajectory shown in A323830.
%C A323831 The number of steps to reach 0, 1, or 5 is given in A323832.
%F A323831 a(n+1) = A321801(2*a(n)). For general numbers, the "repeatedly delete any run of identical digits" operation corresponds to repeatedly applying A321801. - Chai Wah Wu, Feb 11 2019
