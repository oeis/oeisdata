%N A323310 List of e-unitary perfect numbers that are not e-semiproper perfect numbers.
%C A323310 The e-unitary perfect numbers are numbers k such that the sum of their exponential unitary divisors (A322857) equals 2k. The e-semiproper perfect numbers are numbers k such that the sum of their exponential semiproper divisors (A323309) equals 2k. Apparently most of the e-unitary perfect numbers are also e-semiproper perfect numbers: The first 41393 e-unitary perfect numbers are also the first 41393 e-semiproper perfect numbers, but the 41394th e-unitary perfect number is 4769856 which is not e-semiproper perfect. This number, which is the first term of this sequence, was found by Minculete.
%C A323310 The powerful (A001694) terms of this sequence are the primitive terms, i.e., if k is a powerful term, then m*k is a term for any squarefree (A005117) number m that is coprime to k. The only primitive terms below 10^18 are 4769856 and 357739200. If S is the sequence of primitive terms, then the asymptotic density of this sequence is Sum_{n>=1} f(S(n)) = 5.235...*10^(-8), where f(n) = (6/(Pi^2*n))*Product_{prime p|n}(p/(p+1)). - _Amiram Eldar_, May 06 2025
