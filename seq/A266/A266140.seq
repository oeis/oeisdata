%N A266140 Palindromes such that removing at most one digit will result in a term in A110784.
%C A266140 Union of A266139 and A110784. Every palindrome p can have its digits permuted to produce a term m <= p in this sequence, and this sequence is the minimal such sequence (i.e., no term in the sequence can have its digits permuted to form another term in the sequence). Palindromes modulo permutation of digits.
%C A266140 a(n) = A110751(n-1) for 2<=n<=109, which means A110751 contains numbers like 1001 and 1089 which are absent here. - _R. J. Mathar_, Aug 07 2025
%C A266140 The first entry of A002113 not in this sequence here is 1001. - _R. J. Mathar_, Aug 07 2025
