%e A266991 The first 3-digit prime is 101=a(4).
%e A266991 The following 3-digit prime is 103. It does not have the same digital type as 101, since in 103 there are 3 distinct digits, but not in 101. So a(5)=103.
%e A266991 The next two primes 107 and 109 belongs to type 103.
%e A266991 Next consider 113. Here the first two digits are the same, but in 101 and 103 they are not. So 113 is a new type, and a(6)=113.
%e A266991 It remains to find the smallest prime of form XYY. It is 199=a(7).
%e A266991 Now we see that every 3-digit prime is of one of the 4 types a(4),a(5),a(6),a(7).
%e A266991 Next we consider the first 4-digit number a(8)=1009, etc.
%Y A266991 Cf. A264406, A266946.
