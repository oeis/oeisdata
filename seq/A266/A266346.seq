%N A266346 Numbers that can be represented as a product of two numbers with an equal number of significant digits (bits) in binary system.
%C A266346 Indexing starts from zero as a(0) = 0 is a special case in this sequence.
%H A266346 Antti Karttunen, <a href="/A266346/b266346.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 0..9616</a>
%e A266346 1 can be represented as 1*1 (1 being "1" also in base-2 system), thus it is included.
%e A266346 4 can be represented as 2*2, and like any square, is included.
%e A266346 6 can be represented as 2*3, and both "10" and "11" require two bits in binary system, thus 6 is included.
