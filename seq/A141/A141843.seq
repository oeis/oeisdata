%N A141843 Triangular array T(n,k) (n >= 1, 1 <= k <= n) read by rows: row n gives the lexicographically earliest solution to the n queens problem, or n zeros if no solution exists. The k-th queen is placed in square (k, T(n, k)).
%C A141843 History: In December 2017, Matteo Fischetti and Domenico Salvagnin, using Integer Linear Programming (ILP), found solutions for n=56 to n=61; they also found solutions for higher n, but not in contiguous sequence.
%C A141843 Solutions for n=48 to n=55 were found by Wolfram Schubert, around 2010, but not entered in the OEIS.
%C A141843 Entries for board size 46 X 46 (a new solution) and for board size 47 X 47 (already known to Colin Pearson) were added to this sequence in November 2011.
%C A141843 The solution for the 46 X 46 board was discovered by _Matthias Engelhardt_ on Apr 30 2011, the solution for the 47 X 47 board by _Colin S. Pearson_ on Jan 09 2008.
%C A141843 Is it known that the rows converge to (1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 6, 8, 19, 7, 22, 10, 25, 27, 29, 31, ...) ? - _M. F. Hasler_, Jan 20 2019.
%C A141843 Comments from _Don Knuth_, Jul 23 2019: (Start)
%C A141843 (i) Concerning the above question about convergence, note that (a) this is sequence A065188, and (b) such convergence is obvious.
%C A141843 (ii) The new 2019 paper by Fischetti and Salvagnin includes solutions for n = 56-61, 63, 65, 67. 69. 71, 73, 77, 79, 85. 91. 93, 97, 101, 103, 109, 115; so the first unknown case is currently n=62.
%C A141843 (iii) I think this sequence (A141843) ought to be the "archival repository" for progress on this problem (I mean, the lexicographically first solutions to the n queens problem). However, it does not yet include Schubert's previously known solutions for n between 48 and 55. Somebody should now add the Fischetti/Salvagnin results too. Each of these is a significant benchmark example, because it's not easy to prove that a partial n-queens solution cannot be extended.
%C A141843 (iv) Here's an excerpt from a message that Matthias Engelhardt sent me on 30 Oct 2017:
%C A141843 > I do not know of a real paper where it is published; up to know, I
%C A141843 > thought it is contained in the OEIS (Online encyclopedia of integer
%C A141843 > sequences, URL https://oeis.org/A141843), but I detect now that the last

%C A141843 > 53 were computed by him and verified with my completely different program.
%C A141843 >
%C A141843 > I know I got the results from Wolfram; unfortunately, I cannot find them

%C A141843 > http://www.nqueens.de/images/firstAlfa.gif. It is linked on my page
%C A141843 > http://www.nqueens.de/sub/FirstAlfa.en.html (I detected also that I must
%C A141843 > correct a header line there).
%C A141843 >
%C A141843 > I think I should update the OEIS in the next days.
%C A141843 (v) Schubert's result for n=48 hasn't been verified independently, as far as I know. It was too hard for Fischetti and Salvagnin's integer-programming approach, and it's also too hard for my Algorithm X. Maybe a SAT solver would verify it though... .(End)

%E A141843 We extended this sequence by adding new terms 1036 to 1128 relating to two further puzzle solutions, for board size 46 X 46 (a new solution) and for board size 47 X 47. Given that the k-th queen is placed in square (k, a(n, k)), we have added the terms (1, a(46, 1)) to (47, a(47, 47)). - _Colin S. Pearson_, Nov 04 2011
