%N A141348 Number of extreme n-breakable vectors.
%C A141348 An n-breakable vector is a vector v=(v(1),v(2),...,v(n-2)) such that each v(i) is a nonnegative integer and SUM i*v(i) == 1 (mod n-1).
%C A141348 Extreme n-breakable vectors form the set of n-breakable vectors such that every n-breakable vector component-wise dominates some vector from this set, but no two distinct vectors from this set dominate one another.
%C A141348 Number of vectors from the Hilbert basis in A141347 with the first coordinate equal 1.
