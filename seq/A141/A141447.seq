%N A141447 Set m_0=0, and let m_n be the least positive integer that cannot be written in the form Sum_{k=1..oo} a_k k!, with a_k in {m_0,m_1, ..., m_{n-1}}.
%C A141447 This sequence was suggested by Kevin O'Bryant, who provided terms a(0)-a(11); a(12)-a(17) were from _David S. Newman_.
%C A141447 The numbers always come in pairs, the first even, then the following odd number.
%C A141447 The next number in the sequence exceeds 3*10^6.
%e A141447 Example: When m_0=0 and m_1=1, the numbers from 1 to 3 may be written 1=1*1!, 2=1*2!, 3= 1*1! + 1*2!, but there is no way to write 4. So m_2 is taken to be 4.
%t A141447 (* These values can be found by entering m={0,1} separately and then iterating the following program: *)

%t A141447 While[foundFalse&&i<2000000,i=i+1;
