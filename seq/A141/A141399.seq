%N A141399 Positive integers k such that all the distinct primes that divide k or k+1 are members of a set of consecutive primes. In other words, k is included if and only if k*(k+1) is contained in sequence A073491.
%C A141399 The smallest prime in the set of consecutive primes is always 2, since k*(k+1) is even.
%C A141399 No further terms thru 5*10^8. - _Ray Chandler_, Jun 24 2009
%C A141399 a(29) > 2.29*10^25, if it exists. - _Giovanni Resta_, Nov 30 2019
%C A141399 This sequence contains k such that rad(k*(k+1)) is in A055932, where rad = A007947. - _Michael De Vlieger_, Jul 13 2024
%C A141399 These 28 integers are the complete sequence. The product k*(k+1) cannot contain a complete set of prime divisors down to 2 (i.e., be pi-complete as in A055932) past k=633555 because for that to be the case the number of those prime divisors (omega(k*(k+1))) must equal the index of the greatest prime factor (pi(gpf(k*(k+1)))). However that gpf index grows faster than that omega with increasing k, such that after k=633555, that gpf index is always greater, and the factorization of k*(k+1) will always have gaps. See A391449. - _Ken Clements_, Dec 16 2025
%e A141399 20 is factored as 2^2 * 5^1. 21 is factored as 3^1 * 7^1. Since the distinct primes that divide 20 and 21 (which are 2,3,5,7) form a set of consecutive primes, then 20 is in the sequence.
