%N A141065 List of different composite numbers in Pascal-like triangles with index of asymmetry y = 1 and index of obliqueness z = 0 or z = 1.
%C A141065 For the Pascal-like triangle G(n, k) with index of asymmetry y = 1 and index of obliqueness z = 0, which is read by rows, we have G(n, 0) = G(n+1, n+1) = 1, G(n+2, n+1) = 2, G(n+3, k) = G(n+1, k-1) + G(n+1, k) + G(n+2, k) for n >= 0 and k = 1..(n+1).
%C A141065 For the Pascal-like triangle G(n, k) with index of asymmetry y = 1 and index of obliqueness z = 1, which is read by rows, we have G(n, n) = G(n+1, 0) = 1, G(n+2, 1) = 2, G(n+3, k) = G(n+1, k-1) + G(n+1, k-2) + G(n+2, k-1) for n >= 0 and k = 2..(n+2).
%C A141065 From _Petros Hadjicostas_, Jun 09 2019: (Start)
%C A141065 For the triangle with index of asymmetry y = 1 and index of obliqueness z = 0, read by rows, we have G(n, k) = A140998(n, k) for 0 <= k <= n.
%C A141065 For the triangle with index of asymmetry y = 1 and index of obliqueness z = 1, read by rows, we have G(n, k) = A140993(n+1, k+1) for 0 <= k <= n.
%C A141065 Thus, except for the unfortunate shifting of the indices by 1, triangular arrays A140998 and A140993 are mirror images of each other.
%C A141065 As suggested by _R. J. Mathar_ for sequence A141064, in each row of A140998, the composites not appearing in earlier rows are collected, sorted, and added to the sequence.
%C A141065 Obviously, instead of working with A140998, we may work with A140993: in each row of A140993, the primes not appearing in earlier rows may be collected, sorted, and added to the sequence.
%C A141065 Finally, we explain the meaning of the double recurrence in the attached photograph (about Stepan's triangles and Pascal's triangles).
%C A141065 The creator of the stone slab uses the notation G_n^k to denote either one of the two double arrays G(n, k) described above.
%C A141065 On the stone slab, the letter s is used to denote the "index of asymmetry" (denoted by y here) and the letter e is used to denote the 0-1 "index of obliqueness" (denoted by z here). Thus, as described above, there are two kinds of Stepan-Pascal triangles depending on whether e = z equals 0 or 1.
%C A141065 If e = 0, the value of k goes from 1 to n + 1, whereas if e = 1 the value of k goes from s + 1 = y + 1 (= 2 here) to n + s + 1 = n + y + 1.
%C A141065 The "index of asymmetry" s = y can take any (fixed) integer value from 0 to infinity. The fixed value of s = y determines the number of initial conditions: G(n + x + 1, n - e*n + e*x - e + 1) = 2^x for x = 0, 1, ..., s = y. In addition, there is one more initial condition: G(n, e*n) = 1.
%C A141065 The "index of asymmetry" s = y also determines the order of the recurrence (which is probably s + 2 = y + 2): G(n + s + 2, k) = G(n + 1, k - e*s + e - 1) + Sum_{1 <= m <= s + 1} G(n + m, k - e*s + m*e - 2*e).
%C A141065 Apparently, for convenience, the author of the current sequence has shifted the indices of the recurrences that appear on the stone slab (see at the beginning of the comments).
