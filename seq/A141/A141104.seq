%C A141104 Let S(n)=(1/2)*A141104(n). Is the complement of S equal to A004976?
%C A141104 This question has an affirmative answer, as proved by Russo and Schwiebert in the link below.  It can also be proved using the Walnut theorem-prover, using synchronized Fibonacci automata for the two sequences.  These automata take n and y as input, in Fibonacci (Zeckendorf) representation, and accept iff y = a(n) for the respective sequence. - _Jeffrey Shallit_, Jan 27 2024

%F A141104 Let a = (1,3,4,6,8,9,11,12,...) = A000201 = lower Wythoff sequence; let b = (2,5,7,10,13,15,18,...) = A001950 = upper Wythoff sequence. For each odd b(n), let a(m) be the least number in a such that after swapping b(n) and a(m), the resulting new a and b are both increasing. A141104 is the sequence obtained by thus swapping all odds out of A001950.
