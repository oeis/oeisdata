%N A141805 Complement of A031980.
%C A141805 Subsequence of A024670; A141806 gives the terms of A024670 that are not in this sequence.
%C A141805 Not a supersequence of A001235; 7094269 is the smallest number that is in A001235 but not in this sequence (see third example below), the next number is 11261376.

%e A141805 9 is the sum of two distinct nonzero cubes in exactly one way: 9 = 1^3 + 2^3. 9 is not in A031980 because 1 and 2 are earlier terms of A031980. Therefore 9 is a term of this sequence.
%e A141805 1729 is the sum of two distinct nonzero cubes in exactly two ways: 1729 = 9^3 + 10^3 = 1^3 + 12^3. 1729 is not in A031980 because 1 and 12 are earlier terms of A031980. Therefore 1729 is a term of this sequence.
%e A141805 7094269 is the sum of two distinct nonzero cubes in exactly two ways: 7094269 = 70^3 + 189^3 = 133^3 + 168^3. 7094269 is in A031980 because it is not the sum of cubes of two earlier terms of A031980; in the first case 189 and in the second case 133 is not a term of A031980. Therefore 7094269 is not a term of this sequence.
