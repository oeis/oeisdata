%N A141606 Decimal expansion of (W(e-1)/(e-1))^(1/(1-e)), where W(z) denotes the Lambert W function and e = 2.718281828...

%C A141606 (W((y-1)log(z))/((y-1)log(z)))^(1/(1-y)) = e^(W((y-1)log(z))/(y-1)) so that (W(e-1)/(e-1))^(1/(1-e)) = e^(W(e-1)/(e-1)). - _Ross La Haye_, Aug 27 2008
%C A141606 Consider the expression x^x^x^x... where x appears y times. For, say, y = 4 this type of expression is conventionally evaluated as if bracketed x^(x^(x^x)) and is referred to as a "power tower". However, we can also bracket x^x^x^x from the bottom up, e.g., (x^x)^x)^x = x^(x^3). In general, this bracketing will simplify x^x^x^x... to x^(x^(y-1)) when x appears y times in the expression. Solving the equation x^(x^(y-1)) = z for x gives x = (W((y-1)log(z))/((y-1)log(z)))^(1/(1-y)). And setting y = z = e gives the result indicated by this sequence. Special thanks are due to Mike Wentz for introducing me to the "bottom up" bracketing of x^x^x^x... and the motivation for its investigation.
