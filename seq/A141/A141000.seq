%N A141000 Numbers k for which there is a solution to the Jumping Grasshopper game.
%C A141000 That is, numbers k such that there is a choice of signs s_1, s_2, ..., s_k (each +1 or -1) so that (i) 0 <= Sum_{i = 1..j } i*s_i <= k for all 1 <= j <= k-1 and (ii) Sum_{i = 1..k } i*s_i = k. (This forces s_1 = s_2 = s_k = +1.)
%C A141000 It has been shown by Dick Hess and Benji Fisher that a number k >= 20 is in the sequence iff k == 0 or 1 (mod 4). (For a proof see the Applegate link.) It is easy to see that k == 0 or 1 (mod 4) is a necessary condition.
%C A141000 Further comments from _David Applegate_ and _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jul 14 2008: (Start)
%C A141000 An obvious greedy algorithm (working backwards) does the following: For j = k, k-1, ..., 1, let target_j = k - Sum_{i = j+1..k} i * s_i and set s_j = +1 if target_j >= j and s_j = -1 otherwise. This works unless we hit one of five exceptions, in which we must set s_j = -1 instead of +1.
%C A141000 The five exceptions are when (j, target_j) is (5,5), (6,9), (7,14), (8,8), or (9,13). The algorithm also works for the more general case when the target total target_k is different from k, with the additional exception of (8,20). (End)

%F A141000 a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-2) - a(n-3) for n > 9.

%e A141000 4 is a member because we can take s_1 = s_2 = s_4 = +1, s_3 = -1. Note in particular that 1 + 2 -3 + 4 = 4. (See the illustration.)
