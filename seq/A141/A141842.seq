%N A141842 a(n) = first term that can be reduced in n steps via repeated interpretation of a(n) as a base b+1 number where b is the largest digit of a(n), such that b is always 8 so that each interpretation is base 9. Terms already fully reduced (i.e., single digits) are excluded.
%C A141842 It is sometimes possible to compute additional terms by taking the last term, treating it as base 10 and converting to base 9. This may create a term minimally interpretable as base 9 which can converted back to base 10 yielding the previous term in the sequence which will itself yield N further terms. But there is no guarantee (except in base 2) that the term so derived will be the first term to produce a sequence of N+1 terms. There could be another, smaller, term which satisfies that requirement but which uses different terms. Pushing a(15) does not produce a value minimally interpretable as base 9.
%e A141842 a(3) = 680 because 680 is the first number that can produce a sequence of three terms by repeated interpretation as a base 9 number: [680] (base-9) --> [558] (base-9) --> [458] (base-9) --> [377]. Since 377 cannot be minimally interpreted as a base 9 number, the sequence terminates with 458. a(1) = 18 because 18 is the first number that can be reduced once, yielding no further terms minimally interpretable as base 9.
