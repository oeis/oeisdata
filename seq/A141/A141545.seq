%N A141545 Numbers k whose abundance is 12: sigma(k) - 2*k = 12.
%C A141545 Numbers k such that sigma(k) = 2k + 12. - _Wesley Ivan Hurt_, Jul 11 2013
%C A141545 Any term x = a(m) can be combined with any term y = A141549(n) to satisfy the property (sigma(x)+sigma(y))/(x+y) = 2.  Although this property is a necessary condition for two numbers to be amicable, it is not a sufficient one.  So far, these two sequences have not produced an amicable pair.  However, if one is ever found, then it will exhibit y-x = 12. - _Timothy L. Tiffin_, Sep 13 2016
%C A141545 From _Tomohiro Yamada_, Jan 01 2023: (Start)
%C A141545 6p belongs to this sequence if p > 3 is prime since sigma(6p) = 12(p + 1) = 12p + 12.  Moreover, 2^m * (2^(m+1) - 13) is also a term of this sequence if 2^(m+1) - 13 is prime (m+1 is a term of A096818) since sigma(2^m * (2^(m+1) - 13)) = (2^(m+1) + 1) * (2^(m+1) - 13) = 2^(m+1) * (2^(m+1) - 13) + 12.  So 24, 304, 127744, 33501184, and 8589082624 also belong to this sequence.
%C A141545 Problem: is 54 the only term of this sequence which is of neither type given above? (End)

%e A141545 30 is in the sequence since sigma(30) = sigma(2*3*5) = sigma(2)*sigma(3)*sigma(5) = 3*4*6 = 72 = 2(30)+12.  Since this is the second such number whose abundance is 12, a(2) = 30. - _Wesley Ivan Hurt_, Jul 11 2013
