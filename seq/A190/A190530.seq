%N A190530 Numbers k such that 2^k - 3 is not squarefree.
%C A190530 If for some prime p such that 2^p-1 is also prime one has n = 2^(p+1) - 3 an odd perfect number, (that is in particular not squarefree), then the even perfect number m = 2^(p-1)(2^p-1) and the odd perfect number n, are the second pair of perfect numbers (m,n) with m > n such that m/(n+1) is a power of 2. Indeed we have in this case: m/(n+1)=2^(p-2). The only other known pair of such numbers is (m,n) = (28,6), so that m/(n+1) = 28/7 = 2^2.

%C A190530 Contains all numbers k of the forms 20*j + 7 and  110*j + 88 (where 2^k - 3 is divisible by 5^2 and 11^2 respectively). - _Robert Israel_, May 22 2023
%e A190530 a(7) = 88, since 2^88 - 3 is divisible by 11^2, so that it is not squarefree.
