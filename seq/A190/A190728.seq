%N A190728 Least m>1 such that m^3 mod n^2 is 1.
%C A190728 For n = 2, 4, 5 and 8 there are the obvious solutions n^2 + 1, but these are not minimal for n = 3, 6, 7 and 9.
%C A190728 Which other n have least m less than n^2 + 1?
%C A190728 There will be a solution less than n^2 + 1 when n is divisible by 3 or by any prime == 1 (mod 3). - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, May 17 2011
%e A190728 The obvious case for 4 is 4^2 +1 = 17 and 17^3=4913 == 1 (mod 16).
%e A190728 For 6 the least m^3 is not the obvious m=36^2+1=37 but m=13 to give 13^3=2197 == 1 (mod 49).
