%N A190639 Centuries whose prime pattern repeats in the next century.
%C A190639 Alternate definition: Numbers x such that for all N in [100x,100x+99], N is prime iff N+100 is prime.
%C A190639 Contains in particular the first of two consecutive prime-free centuries, i.e., N such that there is no prime in [100 N,100 (N+2)], cf. A181098.
%C A190639 x belongs to this sequence if and only if the primality character of (100 * x) + k is the same as (100 * (x+1)) + k for all k = 0..99. - _V. Raman_, Dec 09 2012

%F A190639 a(n) ~ n. In particular there are x - 200x/log x + O(x/log^2 x) members of this sequence below x. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Dec 09 2012
%F A190639 a(n) = A219996(n) - 1. - _V. Raman_, Dec 09 2012
%e A190639 The first value refers to two consecutive prime-free centuries (cf. A181098); the second value is such that 100*a(2)+17 and 100*a(2)+117 are the only primes between 100*a(2) and 100*(a(2)+2). See the link for more examples.
%Y A190639 Cf. A181098.
