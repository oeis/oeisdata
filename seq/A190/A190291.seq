%N A190291 Number of intervals in the weak (Bruhat) order of the symmetric group S_n that are distributive lattices.
%C A190291 The intervals [u,v] in the weak order that are distributive lattices are characterized by Stembridge. They are the intervals such that u^{-1}.v is fully commutative, i.e. avoids the pattern 321.

%e A190291 Example: for n=3 there are six 1-element intervals, six 2-element intervals, and four intervals that are 3-element chains, for a total of 16.
