%N A190899 Positive integers with recursively self-conjugate partitions.
%C A190899 A partition is self-conjugate if it is fixed under conjugation and it is recursively self-conjugate if it is self-conjugate and the portions below and to the right of its Durfee square are recursively self-conjugate.  (See the Keith paper for a more detailed description.)
%C A190899 Only a finite number of positive integers do not have a recursively self-conjugate partition.  The list is given in A190900.
%C A190899 Integers expressible as a_0^2 + 2*a_1^2 + ... + 2^k*a_k^2 with [a_0, a_1, .., a_k] a non-squashing partition. [See Keith link, p. 6]

%e A190899 From _Michael De Vlieger_, Oct 23 2018: (Start)
%e A190899 None of the partitions of 5, {{5}, {4,1}, {3,2}, {3,1,1}, {2,2,1}, {2,1,1,1}, {1,1,1,1,1}} are self-conjugate, thus 5 is not in the sequence.
%e A190899 The partition {4,4,2,2} of 12 is self-conjugate and is made up of Durfee squares thus 12 is in the sequence.
%e A190899 The partition {8,5,5,5,4,1,1,1} of 30 is self-conjugate. We eliminate the Durfee square {4,4,4,4} which leaves us with {4,1,1,1} which is self-conjugate, but when we eliminate the Durfree square {1} from this, we are left with {1,1,1} which is not self-conjugate. There are no other self-conjugate partitions of 30, therefore 30 is not in the sequence.
%e A190899 Both self-conjugate partitions of 32 are not recursively so. Thus 32 is not in the sequence. (End)
