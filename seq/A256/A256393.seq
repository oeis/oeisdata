%N A256393 Start from a(1) = 2, then alternately add either the largest (if n is even), or the smallest (if n is odd) prime factor of the preceding term a(n-1) to get a(n).
%C A256393 After the initial term, each even-indexed term equals the preceding term plus its largest prime factor, and each odd-indexed term equals the preceding term plus its smallest prime factor.
%C A256393 See also sequence A076271 where a(n+1) = a(n) + lpf(a(n)).
%C A256393 Each term shares exactly one prime factor with the immediately preceding term, and because the sequence is strictly increasing, all the terms after 2 are composite. - _Antti Karttunen_, Apr 19 2015
%C A256393 From a(3) onward, the terms are alternately even and odd. - _Jan Guichelaar_, Apr 24 2015
%C A256393 a(2*n) = A070229(a(2*n-1)); a(2*n+1) = A061228(a(2*n)). - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, May 06 2015
%C A256393 For prime p let [p] denote the sequence with a(1)=p, and generated as for the terms of the current sequence (which according to this notation is then the same as [2]). It so happens that the sequence [p] (for any p?) merges with [2] sooner or later, taking the form of a "tree" as shown in the attached image (Including prime starts up to p=67). Is this pattern of merging bounded or not? Is there just one tree or are there many? Interesting to speculate. The numbers corresponding to the arrival points in [2] of [p] is the sequence 2,6,15,21,51,57,77,84.... The sequence of ("excluded") numbers which do not arise in [p] for any prime p starts as 8,16,20,25,28,32,36,44... Other sequences may refer to the number of iterations required to merge [p] into [2]. See tree picture. - _David James Sycamore_, Aug 25 2016
%C A256393 In this picture, one could also include some [c] sequences, with composite c, see A276269. - _Michel Marcus_, Aug 26 2016
