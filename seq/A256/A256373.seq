%N A256373 The decimal values of binary sequences representing the "bits" form of adjacency matrices of non-isomorphic tournament graphs.
%C A256373 For the tournaments on n vertices, the matrices consist of the first A000568(n)terms of the sequence.

%e A256373 The 4x4 non-isomorphic tournament matrices are as follows:
%e A256373 The first has "bits" value 0, then second 5, the third 34, the fourth 36, where we read the bit pattern only from the elements above the diagonal, starting at the first row, left to right, then top to bottom.
%e A256373 There are twelve 5x5 non-isomorphic tournament matrices;  their bit patterns are  0, 5, 34, 36, 100, 165, 520, 528, 544, 549, 565, 814.
