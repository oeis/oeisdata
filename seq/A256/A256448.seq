%N A256448 a(n) = A250474(n+1) - A250477(n).
%C A256448 a(n) tells how many more positive integers there are <= prime(n+1)^2 whose smallest prime factor is at least prime(n+1), as compared to how many positive integers there are <= (prime(n) * prime(n+1)) whose smallest prime factor is at least prime(n).
%C A256448 Conjecture 1: for n >= 2, a(n) > 0.
%C A256448 Conjecture 2: ratio a(n)/A256447 converges towards 1. See the associated plots in A256447 and A256449 and comments in A050216.
%C A256448 As what comes to the second conjecture, it's not necessarily true. See the plots linked into A256468. - _Antti Karttunen_, Mar 30 2015

%e A256448 For n=1, the respective primes are prime(1) = 2 and prime(2) = 3, and the ranges in question are [1, 9] and [1, 6]. The former range contains 4 such numbers whose lpf (A020639) is at least 3, namely {3, 5, 7, 9}, while the latter range contains 5 such numbers whose lpf is at least 2, namely {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, thus a(1) = 4 - 5 = -1.
%e A256448 For n=2, the respective primes are prime(2) = 3 and prime(3) = 5, and the ranges in question are [1, 25] and [1, 15]. The former range contains 8 such numbers whose lpf is at least 5, namely {5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 25}, while the latter range contains 7 such numbers whose lpf is at least 3, namely {3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15}, thus a(2) = 8 - 7 = 1.
%e A256448 For n=3, the respective primes are prime(3) = 5 and prime(4) = 7, and the ranges in question are [1, 49] and [1, 35]. The former range contains 13 such numbers whose lpf is at least 7, namely {7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 49}, while the latter range contains 11 such numbers whose lpf is at least 5, namely {5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 25, 29, 31, 35}, thus a(3) = 13 - 11 = 2.
