%N A256099 Decimal expansion of the real root of a cubic used by Omar Khayyám in a geometrical problem.
%C A256099 This geometrical problem is considered in the Alten et al. reference on pp. 190-192.
%C A256099 The geometrical problem is to find in the first quadrant the point P on a circle (radius R) such that the ratio of the normal to the y-axis  through P and the radius equals the ratio of the segments of the radius on the y-axis. See the link with a figure and more details. For Omar Khayyám see the references as well as the Wikipedia and MacTutor Archive links.
%C A256099 The ratio of the length of the normal x and the segment h on the y-axis starting at the origin is called xtilde, and satisfies the cubic equation
%C A256099   xtilde^3 -2*xtilde^2 + 2*xtilde - 2 = 0. This xtilde is the tangent of the angle alpha between the positive y-axis and the radius vector from the origin to the point P. This cubic equation has only one real solution xtilde = tan(alpha) given in the formula section. The present decimal expansion belongs to xtilde.
%C A256099 Apart from the first digit the same as A192918. - _R. J. Mathar_, Apr 14 2015
