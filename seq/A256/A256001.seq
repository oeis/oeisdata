%N A256001 Minimum sum of a nonnegative integer triple that takes n moves to reach a 0 component, where a move picks two components, subtracts the smaller from the larger, and doubles the smaller.

%C A256001 a(25) <= 850815.
%C A256001 Conjecture: last diameters n are for S = 5*2^(n-1) when n>=1, i.e. 5 for diameter 1, 10 for diameter 2, 20 for diameter 3, ... This formula works for all diameters calculated up to S=470K. The diameter of S = 5*2^(n-1) is n which is verified up to n=19; i.e., S=1310720. However, a proof is needed to confirm this formula (as we cannot exclude the possibility that higher S leads to a lower diameter). (End)

%e A256001 The triple (1,2,3) is the triple with minimum sum that has no 0's or equal members and reaches a 0 after the 2 moves (1,2,3) -> (2,2,2) -> (4,0,2). Since the sum of this triple is 6, a(2) = 6.
