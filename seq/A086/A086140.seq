%N A086140 Primes p such that three (the maximum number) primes occur between p and p+12.
%C A086140 p+12 must be a prime. - _Harvey P. Dale_, Jun 11 2015
%C A086140 A086140 is the union of A022006 and A022007. By merging the two b-files I have extended the current b-file up to n=10000 (nearly n=20000 would have been possible). I add a comparison (see Links) between the frequency of prime 5-tuples and an asymptotic approximation, which is unproven but likely to be true, and based on a conjecture first published by Hardy and Littlewood in 1923. Twins, triples and quadruplets are treated as well. - _Gerhard Kirchner_, Dec 07 2016

%e A086140 There are two types of prime 5-tuples, and both are represented in this sequence. (11, 13, 17, 19, 23) is a prime 5-tuple of the form (p, p+2, p+6, p+8, p+12), so 11 is in the sequence, and (97, 101, 103, 107, 109) is a prime 5-tuple of the form (p, p+4, p+6, p+10, p+12), so 97 is in the sequence. - _Michael B.
