%N A086979 Increasing peaks in the prime gap sequence A038664.
%C A086979 a(n) is Pi(p_k), the number of primes up to and including p_k, where p_k is the initial prime of a prime gap g = p_k+1 - p_k. All even gaps smaller than g occur at a smaller prime and the next even gap g+2 also occurs earlier.
