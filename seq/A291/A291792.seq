%N A291792 Numbers m such that Post's tag system started at the word (100)^m eventually dies (i.e., reaches the empty string).
%C A291792 These are the numbers m such that A291793(m)=0, or equivalently A284121(m)=1.
%C A291792 Comments from _Lars Blomberg_ on the method used in calculating the terms, Sep 14 2017: (Start)
%C A291792 Here is an overview of the method I have been using.
%C A291792 Build the words in a large byte array. Each iteration just adds 00 or 1101 to the end and removes 3 bytes from the beginning, without moving the whole word, just keeping track of the length of the word and where it starts within the array.
%C A291792 When the word reaches the end of the array it is moved to the beginning. This allows for very fast iterations, as long as the word is substantially shorter than the array.
%C A291792 The size of the byte array is 10^9, this is the longest word we can handle.
%C A291792 As for cycle detection, the words at iterations A: k*10^5 and B: (k+1)*10^5 are saved.
%C A291792 For iterations above B when the current word has the same length as B (a fast test), then check if the current word is equal to the one at B. If so, we have a cycle whose length can be determined simply by continued iterating. When the current iteration reaches C: (k+2)*10^5, move B->A, C->B, and continue.
%C A291792 The cycle has started somewhere between A and B and we know the cycle length. So restart two iterations at A and initially iterate one of them by the cycle length. Then iterate the two in parallel (being a cycle length apart) until they are equal, which gives the start of the cycle. Only the two words being iterated need to be stored.
%C A291792 One drawback with this method is that it cannot detect a cycle longer than 10^5 (or whatever value we choose). In that case the iterations will go on forever.
%C A291792 (End)
%C A291792 The trajectory of the word (100)^m for m=110 dies after 43913328040672 iterations, so 110 is a term in this sequence. The longest word in the trajectory is 31299218, which appeared at iteration 14392308412264. - _Lars Blomberg_, Oct 04 2017

%Y A291792 Asveld's Table 1 gives data about the behavior of Post's 3-shift tag system {00/1101} applied to the word (100)^n. The first column gives n, the nonzero values in column 2 give A291792, and columns 3 through 7 give A284119, A291793 (or A284121), A291794, A291795, A291796.
