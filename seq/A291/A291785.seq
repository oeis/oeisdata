%N A291785 Iterate the map A291784: k -> (psi(k)+phi(k))/2, starting with n, until a power of a prime (A000961) is reached, or -1 if that never happens.
%C A291785 Primes and prime powers are fixed points under the map f(k) = (psi(k)+phi(k))/2. (If n = p^k, then psi(n) = p^k(1+1/p), phi(n) = p^k(1-1/p), and their average is p^k, so n is a fixed point under the map.)
%C A291785 Since f(n)>n if n is not a prime power, there can be no nontrivial cycles.
%C A291785 Wall (1985) observes that the trajectories of 45 and 50 are unbounded, so a(45) = a(50) = -1.
%C A291785 Also 48 and many more terms seem to have unbounded trajectories. - _Hugo Pfoertner_, Sep 03 2017.
%C A291785 Obviously any number in the trajectory of a number with unbounded trajectory (in particular that of 45, A291787) again has this property. A291788 is the union of all these. - _M. F. Hasler_, Sep 03 2017
