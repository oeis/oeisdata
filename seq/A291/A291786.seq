%N A291786 a(n) = number of iterations of k -> (psi(k)+phi(k))/2 (A291784) needed to reach a prime or a power of a prime or 1, or -1 if that doesn't happen.
%C A291786 Primes and prime powers are fixed points under the map f(k) = (psi(k)+phi(k))/2, so in that case we take a(n)=0. (If n = p^k, then psi(n) = p^k(1+1/p), phi(n) = p^k(1-1/p), and their average is p^k, so n is a fixed point under the map.)
%C A291786 Since f(n)>n if n is not a prime power, there can be no nontrivial cycles.
%C A291786 Wall (1985) observes that the trajectories of 45 and 50 are unbounded, so a(45) = a(50) = -1. See A291787, A291788.
