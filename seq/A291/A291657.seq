%N A291657 Primes p such that p is a primitive root modulo prime(p).
%C A291657 The conjecture in A291615 implies that the current sequence has infinitely many terms. In fact, if there are only finitely many primes p with p a primitive root modulo prime(p) and we let P denote the product of all such primes, then by Dirichlet's theorem there is a prime q == 1 (mod 4*P) and hence any prime p with p a primitive root modulo prime(p) is a quadratic residue modulo q and hence not a primitive root modulo q.
%C A291657 Conjecture: a(n)/(n*log(n)) has a positive limit as n tends to the infinity. Equivalently, all the terms in this sequence form a subset of the set of all primes with positive asymptotic density.
