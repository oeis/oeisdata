%N A291150 Number of ways to write 2*n+1 as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 4*w^2, where x,y,z,w are nonnegative integers with x <= y <= z such that 2^x + 2^y + 2^z + 1 is prime.
%C A291150 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n = 0,1,2,..., and a(n) = 1 only for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 14, 15, 21, 23, 35, 41, 43, 59, 71, 309, 435.
%C A291150 (ii) Any positive even number not divisibly by 8 and other than 6 and 14 can be written as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2, where w is a positive odd integer, and x,y,z are nonnegative integers with 2^x + 2^y + 2^z + 1 prime.
%C A291150 (iii) Let n be a positive integer. If n is not divisible by 8, then n can be written as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 with x,y,z,w nonnegative integers such that 2^x + 2^y + 1 is prime. If n is not a multiple of 2^7 = 128, then we can write n as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 with x,y,z,w nonnegative integers such that 2^x + 2^y - 1 is prime.
%C A291150 (iv) Let n be a positive integer. If n is not divisible by 8, then n can be written as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 with x,y,z,w nonnegative integers such that 2^x + 2*2^y + 3*2^z + 4*2^w - 1 is prime. If n is not a multiple of 2^8 = 256, then we can write n as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 with x,y,z,w nonnegative integers such that 2^x + 2*2^y +3*2^z + 4*2^w + 1 is prime.
%C A291150 I have verified that a(n) > 0 for all n = 0..10^7. - _Zhi-Wei Sun_, Aug 23 2017
