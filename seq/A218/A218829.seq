%N A218829 Number of ordered ways to write n = k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that prime(k) + 2 and prime(prime(m)) + 2 are both prime.
%C A218829 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 2, and a(n) = 1 only for n = 3, 22, 25, 38, 101, 273.
%C A218829 (ii) Each n = 2, 3, ... can be written as k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that 6*k - 1, 6*k + 1 and prime(prime(m)) + 2 are all prime.
%C A218829 (iii) Any integer n > 5 can be written as k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that phi(k) - 1, phi(k) + 1 and prime(prime(m)) + 2 are all prime, where phi(.) is Euler's totient function.
%C A218829 (iv) If n > 2 is neither 10 nor 31, then n can be written as k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that prime(k) + 2 and prime(prime(prime(m))) + 2 are both prime.
%C A218829 (v) If n > 1 is not equal to 133, then n can be written as k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that 6*k - 1, 6*k + 1 and prime(prime(prime(m))) + 2 are all prime.
%C A218829 Clearly, each part of the conjecture implies the twin prime conjecture.
%C A218829 We have verified part (i) for n up to 10^9. See the comments in A237348 for an extension of this part.
