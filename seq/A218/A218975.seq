%N A218975 Number of connected cyclic conjugacy classes of subgroups of the alternating group.
%C A218975 a(n) is also the number of connected even partitions of n in the following sense. Given a partition of n, the vertices are the parts of the partition and two vertices are connected if and only if their gcd is greater than 1. We call a partition connected if the graph is connected.
