%N A349168 Numbers k such that sigma(k) and A003961(k) share a prime power divisor that is not a unitary divisor of A003961(k). Here A003961(n) is fully multiplicative function with a(prime(k)) = prime(k+1).
%C A349168 Numbers k such that A342671(k) [= gcd(sigma(k), A003961(k)] and A349161(k) [= A003961(k)/A342671(k)] share a prime factor.

%e A349168 For n = 8 = 2^3, sigma(8) = 15 = 3*5, while A003961(8) = 3^3 = 27. These share the prime power divisor 3, which however is not a unitary divisor of 27, therefore 8 is included in this sequence.
