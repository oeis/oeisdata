%N A349549 The smallest k such that a regular k-gon with all diagonals drawn contains cells with a total number of sides of 3 through n, or -1 if no such k exists.
%C A349549 If a(15) > 0 it is greater than 765.
%C A349549 Other than the 15-gon, which contains a central 15-gon by its construction, see A342222, the first k-gon to contain a 15-sided cell is the 399-gon, but it does not contain a 13-gon or a 14-gon. The 647-gon contains cells with total sides 3-12, 14, 15, but it does not contain a 13-gon.
%C A349549 The 561-gon contains cells with total sides 3-14, 16 but it does not contain a 15-gon.
%C A349549 Other than the 17-gon itself no k-gon is currently known that contains a 17-sided cell.
%C A349549 The first k-gon to contain an 18-sided cell is the 231-gon, but it does not contain cells with total sides 13, 15-17. Curiously the other known k-gons to contain 18-sided cells are 245, 469, 628, 708, and like the 231-gon, all of these are also missing the 13, 15-17 sided cells.
%C A349549 See the cross-references for images of the k-gons.
%H A349549 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A349549/a349549_1.png">Image showing a close-up of the 14-sided cell in the 211-gon</a>. Zoom in to see the vertices marked as white dots around the 14-gon, shown in violet. The bottom three vertices are extremely close together -- if the image were expanded so that the outer two of these vertices were 1 cm away from the inner vertex then the size of the entire 211-gon image would be slightly over 3.5 km in diameter.
%e A349549 The number of cells containing m sides, where 3 <= m <= n, is given below for the currently known values of n. For odd k the list of 0's leading up to the single central k-gon is shown as '...'.
