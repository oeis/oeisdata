%e A349502 2 is a term since the harmonic mean of the divisors of 2 is 4/3 = 1 + 1/3 and the elements of the continued fraction, {1, 3}, are different.
%e A349502 4 is not a term since the harmonic mean of the divisors of 4 is 12/7 = 1 + 1/(1 + 1/(2 + 1/2)) and the elements of the continued fraction, {1, 1, 2, 2}, are not distinct.
