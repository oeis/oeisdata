%N A157985 Perfect powers (m^k where m is an integer and k >= 2) multiplied by -1 when m is prime for largest k (m^k thus a prime power).
%C A157985 The rather strange phrase "largest k" in the definition refers to the fact that there can be several ways to write a number in the form m^k. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 01 2019

%F A157985 a(n) = {m^k}_n * (-1)^(Pi(m) - Pi(m-1)) where {m^k}_n is the n-th perfect power with positive integer base m corresponding to largest integer exponent k and Pi(m) is the prime counting function evaluated at m.
%F A157985 a(n) = A001597(n) * (-1)^(Pi(m) - Pi(m-1)), with m = A001597(n)^(1/{A025479(n)).
%Y A157985 Cf. A001597 (perfect powers), A025479 (largest exponents of perfect powers.
%Y A157985 Cf. A025478 (least roots of perfect powers).
%Y A157985 Cf. A157986.
