%N A157242 Number of ways to write the n-th positive odd integer in the form p+2^x+11*2^y with p a prime congruent to 5 mod 6 and x,y positive integers.
%C A157242 On Feb. 24, 2009, Zhi-Wei Sun conjectured that a(n)=0 if and only if n<15 or n=17, 20, 23, 86, 124; in other words, except for 33, 39, 45, 171 and 247, any odd integer greater than 28 can be written as the sum of a prime p=5 (mod 6), a positive power of 2 and eleven times a positive power of 2. Sun verified the conjecture for odd integers below 5*10^7. Knowing the conjecture from Sun, Qing-Hu Hou and D. S. McNeil have continued the verification for odd integers below 1.5*10^8 and 10^12 respectively, and they have found no counterexample. Compare the conjecture with Crocker's result that there are infinitely many positive odd integers not of the form p+2^x+2^y with p an odd prime and x,y positive integers.
