%C A157639 From _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Aug 03 2009, Aug 09 2009, Sep 02 2009: (Start)
%C A157639 Consider an arbitrarily large lattice. Define S1 as the square having both X and Y in the closed interval [1,3]. From a single viewpoint at (2,2), every lattice point on or inside S1 is visible. S1 (including its edges) covers 3 rows X 3 columns of lattice points, so a(3)=1. Also, since an n-row X n-column subset of S1 that includes the one viewpoint can be selected for n=1 and for n=2, this 1-viewpoint example is sufficient to show that a(n)=1 for n = 1..3.
%C A157639 Define S2 as the square having both X and Y in [1,5]. Every lattice point in S2 is visible from at least one of the two viewpoints (3,1) and (3,4). S2 covers 5 rows X 5 columns of points, so a(5) <= 2. Since a 4-row X 4-column subset of S2 that includes the two viewpoints can also be selected, a(4) <= 2. Since no 1-viewpoint solution exists for n > 3, we have a(n)=2 for n=4 and n=5.
%C A157639 Proceeding similarly, every lattice point where X and Y are both in [1,23] is visible from at least one of the three viewpoints (14,14), (15,14), and (14,15), so a(n) <= 3 for n = 2..23. Since no 2-viewpoint solution exists for n > 5, we have a(n)=3 for n = 6..23.
%C A157639 Together, the three 4-viewpoint solutions {(20,20), (21,20), (20,21), (21,21)}, {(43,51), (72,65), (58,80), (57,66)}, and {(28,34), (105,105), (34,99), (99,40)} are sufficient to show that a(n) <= 4 for n = 24..132: in these solutions, every lattice point where X and Y are both in [1,m], where m = 40, 128, and 132, respectively, is visible from at least one viewpoint, and all four viewpoints would fit in a k-row X k-column subset of the m-row X m-column square, for k as small as 2, 30, and 78, respectively. Thus these three solutions demonstrate that a(n) <= 4 for the overlapping ranges n = 2..40, n = 30..128, and n = 78..132, respectively. Since (per an exhaustive search) no 3-viewpoint solution exists for n = 24..132, we have a(n)=4 for n = 24..132.
%C A157639 Per exhaustive search, no 4-viewpoint solution exists for n=133, so a(133)=5.
%C A157639 In summary: a(1..3)=1, a(4..5)=2, a(6..23)=3, a(24..132)=4, a(133)=5. (End)
