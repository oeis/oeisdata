%N A157188 Number of ways to write prime(n) as p*q-(p+q) with primes p<=q.
%C A157188 Records in this sequence are given in A157189, the corresponding primes in A157190.

%e A157188 a(1)=0 since prime(1) = 2 cannot be written as pq-(p+q) for primes p,q.
%e A157188 a(2)=2 since prime(2) = 3 = 2*5-(2+5) = 3*3-(3+3) are the two possibilities.
