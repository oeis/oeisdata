%N A031561 that the continued fraction for sqrt(k) has even period and if the last term of the periodic part is deleted the central term is 63.
%C A031561 The "central term" is the term appearing at 1/2 the length of the period of the continued fraction, not the term succeeding that term. For instance, the periodic part of the continued fraction of sqrt(4139) is {2, 1, 63, 1, 2, 128}. - _Harvey P. Dale_, Sep 07 2012
