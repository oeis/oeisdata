%N A105489 Number of partitions of {1...n} containing 3 detached pairs of consecutive integers, i.e., partitions in which only 1- or 2-strings of consecutive integers can appear in a block and there are exactly three 2-strings.
%C A105489 Number of partitions enumerated by A105480 in which the maximal length of consecutive integers in a block is 2.
%C A105489 With offset 3t, number of partitions of {1...N} containing 3 detached strings of t consecutive integers, where N = n + 3j, t = 2 + j, j = 0, 1, 2, ..., i.e., partitions of {1,..,N} in which only v-strings of consecutive integers can appear in a block, where v=1 or v=t and there are exactly three t-strings.

%F A105489 a(n) = binomial(n-3, 3)*Bell(n-4), which is the case r=3 in the general case of r pairs, d(n,r) = binomial(n-r, r)*Bell(n-r-1), which is the case t=2 of the general formula d(n,r,t) = binomial(n-r*(t-1), r)*Bell(n-r*(t-1)-1).
%e A105489 a(6) = 2 because the partitions of {1,2,3,4,5,6} with 3 detached pairs of consecutive integers are 12/34/56, 1256/34.
