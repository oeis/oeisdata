%N A105266 a(1)=1 and, for n>1, a(n) is the smallest integer greater than a(n-1) such that no three terms x,y,z of the sequence, with x<y<z, satisfy z-y=y-x+1.
%C A105266 It appears that {a(n)] consists exactly of those positive integers whose base-3 representation satisfies (i) only 0's follow a 1 and (ii) a final run of 0's must follow a 1.
