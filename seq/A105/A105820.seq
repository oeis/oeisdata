%N A105820 Triangle giving the numbers of different forests of m trees of smallest order 2, i.e., without isolated vertices.
%C A105820 Forests of order N with m components, m > floor(N/2) must contain an isolated vertex since it is impossible to partition N vertices in floor(N/2) + 1 or more trees without giving only one vertex to a tree.

%F A105820 a(n) = sum over the partitions of N: 1K1 + 2K2 + ... + NKN, with exactly m parts and no part equal to 1, of Product_{i=1..N} binomial(A000055(i)+Ki-1, Ki).
%F A105820 G.f.: 1/Product_{i>=2}(1 - x*y^i)^A000055(i). - _Vladeta Jovovic_, Apr 27 2005
%e A105820 a(12) = 1 because 5 nodes can be partitioned into two trees only in one way: one tree gets 3 nodes and the other tree gets 2. Since A000055(3) = A000055(2) = 1, there is only one forest. (The forests of order less than or equal to 5 are depicted in the Weisstein link.)
