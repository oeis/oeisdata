%N A105491 Number of partitions of {1...n} containing 5 detached pairs of consecutive integers, i.e., partitions in which only 1- or 2-strings of consecutive integers can appear in a block and there are exactly five 2-strings.
%C A105491 Number of partitions enumerated by A105482 in which the maximal length of consecutive integers in a block is 2.
%C A105491 With offset 5t, number of partitions of {1,...,N} containing 5 detached strings of t consecutive integers, where N=n+5j, t=2+j, j = 0,1,2,..., i.e., partitions of {1,...,N} in which only v-strings of consecutive integers can appear in a block, where v=1 or v=t and there are exactly five t-strings.

%e A105491 a(10)=15; the enumerated 15 partitions of {1,...,10} with 5 detached pairs of consecutive integers include (1,2,5,6,9,10)(3,4,7,8) and (1,2,9,10)(3,4,7,8)(5,6).
