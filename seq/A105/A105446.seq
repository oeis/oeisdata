%N A105446 Number of symbols in the Roman Fibonacci number representation of n.
%C A105446 The Roman Fibonacci numbers are composed from the values of the Fibonacci Numbers (A000045) with the grammar of the Roman Numerals (A006968) and a few rules to disambiguate.
%C A105446 The alphabet: {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, A=13, B=21, C=34, D=55, E=89, F=144, ...}.
%C A105446 Rule one: of the infinite set of representations of integers by this grammar, always restrict to the subset of those with shortest length.
%C A105446 Rule two: if there are two or more in the subset of shortest representations, restrict to the subset with fewest subtractions [A31 preferred to 188, B31 preferred to 1AA, CA preferred to 8D, DB preferred to AE].
%C A105446 Rule three: if there are two or more representations per Rules one and two, restrict to the subset with the most duplications of characters [22 preferred to 31, 33 preferred to 51, 55 preferred to 82, 88 preferred to A3, BBB preferred to D53, CC preferred to BE]. We do not need a Rule four for a while...
%C A105446 Lemma: no Roman Fibonacci number requires three consecutive instances of the same symbol. Proof: 3*F(i) = F(i+2) + F(i-2).
%C A105446 Question: what is the asymptotic length of the Roman Fibonacci numbers?

%F A105446 a(n) = number of symbols in the Roman Fibonacci number representation of n, as defined in "Comments." a(n) = 1 iff n is an element of A000045. a(n) = 2 iff the shortest Roman Fibonacci number representation of n is as the sum or difference of two elements of A000045 and n is not an element of A000045.
%e A105446 a(1) = 1 because 1 is a Fibonacci number, equal to its own representation as a Roman Fibonacci number.
%e A105446 a(4) = 2 because 4 is not a Fibonacci number, but can be represented as the sum or difference of two Fibonacci numbers, with its Roman Fibonacci number representation being "22" (not "31" per rule three).
%e A105446 a(17) = 3 because the Roman Fibonacci number representation of 17 has three symbols, namely "A22" (not "188" per rule two).
%e A105446 a(80) = 4 because the Roman Fibonacci number representation of 80 has four symbols, namely "DB22".
%Y A105446 A105447 = integers with A105446(n) = 2. A105448 = integers with A105446(n) = 3. A105449 = integers with A105446(n) = 4. A105450 = integers with A105446(n) = 5. A023150 = integers with A105446(n) = 6. A105452 = integers with A105446(n) = 7. A105453 = integers with A105446(n) = 8. A105454 = integers with A105446(n) = 9. A105455 = integers with A105446(n) = 10.
%Y A105446 Cf. A000045, A006968.
%Y A105446 Appears to be a duplicate of A058978.
