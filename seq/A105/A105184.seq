%N A105184 Primes that can be written as concatenation of two primes in decimal representation.
%C A105184 Primes that can be written as the concatenation of two distinct primes is the same sequence.
%C A105184 Number of terms < 10^n: 0, 4, 48, 340, 2563, 19019, 147249, ... - _T. D. Noe_, Oct 04 2010

%e A105184 193 is in the sequence because it is the concatenation of the primes 19 and 3.
%e A105184 197 is in the sequence because it is the concatenation of the primes 19 and 7.
%e A105184 199 is not in the sequence because there is no way to break it into two substrings such that both are prime: neither 1 nor 99 is prime, and 19 is prime but 9 is not.
