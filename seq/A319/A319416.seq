%N A319416 Cuts-resistance of n: number of applications of Lernormand's "raboter" map needed to transform the binary expansion of n to the empty string.
%C A319416 Here we are using Lenormand's "raboter" map in a stricter sense than in A318921 and A319419. If S is a binary string with successive runs of lengths b,c,d,e,..., the "raboter" map sends S to the binary string with successive runs of lengths b-1,c-1,d-1,e-1,... Runs of length 0 are omitted (they are indicated by dots in the examples below).
%C A319416 To get a(n), start with S equal to the binary expansion of n beginning with the most significant bit, and keep applying the map until we reach the empty string.
%C A319416 After the first step, the string may start with a string of 0's: this is acceptable because we are working with strings, not binary expansions of numbers.
%C A319416 For example, 34 = 100010 -> .00.. = 00 -> 0. = 0 -> . (the empty string), taking 3 steps, so a(34) = 3.
%C A319416 Note: this is not the same as the number of applications of the map k -> A318921(k) needed to reduce the binary expansion of n to zero (because A318921 does not distinguish between 0 and the empty string).
%C A319416 This is also not the same as the number of applications of the map k -> A319419(k) needed to reduce the binary expansion of n to -1 (because A319419 does not distinguish between a string of 0's and a single 0).
%C A319416 The value k appears for the first time when n = 2^k - 1.
