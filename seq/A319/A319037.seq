%N A319037 a(n) is the length of the longest run of consecutive triangular numbers with n divisors.
%C A319037 Every number with an odd number of divisors is a square, and no two consecutive positive triangular numbers are squares, so for all odd n, a(n) = 1 if a triangular number with n divisors exists, 0 otherwise.
%C A319037 9 <= a(48) <= 13. - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Feb 13 2021
%C A319037 T(190254647) = 18098415447674628 is the smallest triangular number that begins a run of 9 consecutive triangular numbers with 48 divisors. Does a longer run exist? - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, May 29 2022
%e A319037 a(1) = 1 because there is only one triangular number T(k) = k*(k+1)/2 with 1 divisor: T(1) = 1.
%e A319037 a(2) = 1 because there is only one triangular number with 2 divisors: T(2) = 3, the only prime triangular number.
%e A319037 a(3) = 0 because there is no triangular number with 3 divisors.
%e A319037 a(4) = 4 because {6, 10, 15, 21} is the longest run of consecutive triangular numbers with 4 divisors.
%e A319037 a(16) = 6 because T(692993)..T(692998) is a run of 6 consecutive triangular numbers with 16 divisors, and no longer run of such triangular numbers exists.
%e A319037 a(24) = 7 because T(1081135121474335700644)..T(1081135121474335700650) is a run of 7 consecutive triangular numbers with 24 divisors, and no longer run of such triangular numbers exists. - _Jinyuan Wang_, Aug 23 2020
