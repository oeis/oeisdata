%N A319908 Lesser of twin primes pair p, such that the Mersenne numbers 2^p - 1 and 2^(p+2) - 1 have the same number of prime factors.
%C A319908 The corresponding number of prime factors is 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 5, 4, 2, ...
%C A319908 Assuming that Mersenne numbers (2^p-1 with p prime) are always squarefree, the distinction between number of prime factors with multiplicity (A001222) and number of different prime factors (A001221) is inessential.
%e A319908 3 is in the sequence since 3 and 5 are twin primes pair, and 2^3-1=7 and 2^5-1=31 are both primes, thus having the same number of prime factors.
%e A319908 71 is in the sequence since 71 and 73 are twin primes pair and 2^71-1 and 2^73-1 both have 3 prime factors.
