%N A319796 Even numbers that have middle divisors, where "middle divisor" means a divisor in the half-open interval [sqrt(n/2), sqrt(n*2)).
%C A319796 Even numbers k such that the symmetric representation of sigma(k) has an odd number of parts.
%C A319796 An even number A005843 is in this sequence iff A067742(t) != 0.
%C A319796 For the definition of middle divisors, see A067742.

%C A319796 From _Hartmut F. W. Hoft_, Mar 28 2023: (Start)
%C A319796 By Theorem 1 (iii) in A067742, the number of middle divisors of a(n) equals the width of the symmetric representation of sigma(a(n)), SRS(a(n)), on the diagonal which equals the triangle entry A249223(n, A003056(n)). The maximum widths of the center part of SRS(a(n)) need not occur at the diagonal.
%C A319796 For example, a(7) = 2 * 3^2 = 18, SRS(18) has a single part with maximum width 2 while its width at the diagonal equals 1 = A067742(18), and divisor 3 is the only middle divisor of a(7). (End)
