%e A319250 11 and 13 are a pair of twin primes both having 2 as a primitive root, so 0 is a term.
%e A319250 59 and 61 are a pair of twin primes both having 2 as a primitive root, so 2 is a term.
%e A319250 Although 227 and 229 are a pair of twin primes, neither of them has 2 as a primitive root, so 9 is not a term.
