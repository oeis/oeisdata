%N A319035 Triangular numbers T(k) that have the same number of divisors as their successors T(k+1).
%C A319035 Not every term T(k) has the same prime signature as its successor triangular number T(k+1); the first counterexample is the pair (T(52), T(53)) = (1378, 1431) = (2 * 13 * 53, 3^3 * 53), each of which has 8 divisors. The first counterexample in which the two triangular numbers have the same number of distinct prime factors is (T(45630), T(45631)) = (1041071265, 1041116896) = (3^3 * 5 * 13^2 * 45631, 2^5 * 23 * 31 * 45631), each of which has 48 divisors.

%e A319035 T(2) = 6 is a term because 6 = 2 * 3 has 4 divisors (1, 2, 3, 6) and T(3) = 10 = 2 * 5 also has 4 divisors (1, 2, 5, 10).
%e A319035 T(17) = 153 is a term because 153 = 3^2 * 17 has 6 divisors (1, 3, 9, 17, 51, 153) and T(18) = 171 = 3^2 * 19 also has 6 divisors (1, 3, 9, 19, 57, 171).
