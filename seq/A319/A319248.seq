%N A319248 Lesser of the pairs of twin primes in A001122.
%C A319248 Primes p such that both p and p + 2 are both in A001122.
%C A319248 Apart from the first term, all terms are congruent to 11 mod 24, since terms in A001359 are congruent to 5 mod 6 apart from the first one, and terms in A001122 are congruent to 3 or 5 mod 8.
%C A319248 Note that "there are infinitely many pairs of twin primes" and "there are infinitely many primes with primitive root 2" are two famous and unsolved problems, so a stronger conjecture implying both of them is that this sequence is infinite.
%C A319248 Also note that a pair of cousin primes can't both appear in A001122, while a pair of sexy primes can.

%F A319248 a(n) = A319249(n) - 2.
%F A319248 For n >= 2, a(n) = 24*A319250(n-1) + 11.
%e A319248 11 and 13 is a pair of twin primes both having 2 as a primitive root, so 11 is a term.
%e A319248 59 and 61 is a pair of twin primes both having 2 as a primitive root, so 59 is a term.
%e A319248 Although 101 and 103 is a pair of twin primes, 101 has 2 as a primitive root while 103 doesn't, so 101 is not a term.
