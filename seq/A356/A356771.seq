%N A356771 a(n) is the sum of the Fibonacci numbers in common in the Zeckendorf and dual Zeckendorf representations of n.
%C A356771 The Zeckendorf and dual Zeckendorf representations both express a number n as a sum of distinct positive Fibonacci numbers; these distinct Fibonacci numbers can be encoded in binary (see A022290 for the decoding function):
%C A356771 - in the Zeckendorf representation (or greedy Fibonacci representation):
%C A356771   - Fibonacci numbers are as big as possible (see A035517),
%C A356771   - and the corresponding binary encoding, A003714(n),
%C A356771     cannot have two consecutive 1's;
%C A356771 - in the dual Zeckendorf representation (or lazy Fibonacci representation):
%C A356771   - Fibonacci numbers are as small as possible (see A112309),
%C A356771   - and the corresponding binary encoding, A003754(n+1),
%C A356771     cannot have two consecutive nonleading 0's.
%C A356771 See A356326 for a similar sequence.

%F A356771 a(n) = A022290(A003714(n) AND A003754(n+1)) (where AND denotes the bitwise AND operator).
%F A356771 a(n) = 0 iff n belongs to A331467.
%F A356771 a(n) = n iff n belongs to A000071.
%e A356771 For n = 28:
%e A356771 - using F(k) = A000045(k),
%e A356771 - the Zeckendorf representation of 28 is F(8) + F(5) + F(3),
%e A356771 - the dual Zeckendorf representation of 28 is F(7) + F(6) + F(5) + F(3),
%e A356771 - F(5) and F(3) appear in both representations,
%e A356771 - so a(28) = F(5) + F(3) = 7.
