%N A356700 Numbers k such that Mordell's equation y^2 = x^3 - k has a record number of integral solutions.
%C A356700 Indices of records in A081120. For the record values see A356702.
%e A356700 207 is a term since the equation y^2 = x^3 + 207 has 14 integral solutions, and the number of solutions to y^2 = x^3 - k is less than 14 for 0 < k < 207.
