%N A356404 The number of closed routes of the chess knight, different in shape, consisting of 2 * n jumps on a checkered field without repeating cells of the route.
%C A356404 Various closed routes of a chess knight on an unbounded checkered field are considered. The closed route of the chess knight means that with the last jump the chess knight returns to its original cell. A chess knight cannot jump into the same square twice.
%C A356404 The first three members of the sequence were found by me manually, the remaining members were found by _Talmon Silver_ using a computer program.

%e A356404 a(1)=1, since the only closed route for n=1 can be considered two jumps of a chess knight from any cell and back;
%e A356404 a(2)=3 because the chess knight has 3 closed routes consisting of 4 jumps. We list them in the coordinate plane Oxy:
%e A356404    1st route: (0;0), (1;2), (3;3), (2;1), (0;0);
%e A356404    2nd route: (0;1), (1;3), (3;2), (2;0), (0;1);
%e A356404    3rd route: (0;1), (2;2), (4;1), (2;0), (0;1).
