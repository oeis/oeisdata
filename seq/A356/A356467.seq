%N A356467 Smallest prime congruent to 1 (mod prime(n)) which is the norm of some principal ideal in the ring of prime(n)-th cyclotomic integers.
%C A356467 For the p-th cyclotomic ring of integers, primes which are norms of principal ideals should have asymptotic density 1/(h(p)*(p-1)) where h(p) is the class number of the p-th cyclotomic field.
%e A356467 a(3) = 11 since 11 is the smallest prime congruent to 1 mod 5 (prime(3) = 5), which is the norm of some element in the 5th cyclotomic ring of integers. The algebraic integer x^2-x-1 has norm 11 where x is a primitive 5th root of unity.
%e A356467 a(2) - a(8) are the smallest primes congruent to 1 mod prime(n) as those corresponding cyclotomic fields have class number 1.
%e A356467 a(9) = 599. The 23-rd cyclotomic ring of integers does not have class number 1. The smallest prime congruent to 1 (mod 23) is 47, and there is no cyclotomic integer with norm 47. The algebraic integer x^3-x-1 has norm 599 where x is a primitive 23-rd root of unity.
