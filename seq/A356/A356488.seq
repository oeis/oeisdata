%N A356488 Numbers k such that the equation x^2 - k*y^4 = -1 has a solution for which |y| > 2.
%C A356488 For k > 2, the equation x^2 - k*y^4 = -1 has at most one positive integer solution. If this solution (x, y) exists, we have v = y^2, where v is the smallest integer satisfying the Pell equation u^2 - k*v^2 = -1 (A130227).

%e A356488 The equation x^2 - 2*y^4 = -1 has only two positive solutions (1, 1) and (239, 13), so 2 is in the sequence.
