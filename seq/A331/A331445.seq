%N A331445 Complete list of numbers of twisted cubics on a general Calabi-Yau threefold which is a complete intersection in some projective space.
%C A331445 There are exactly five types of such threefolds: the quintic in P^4, the complete intersections (3, 3) and (2, 4) in P^5, the complete intersection (2, 2, 3) in P^6 and finally (2, 2, 2, 2) in P^7. The counts are listed in that order.
