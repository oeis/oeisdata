%N A331939 Triangle read by rows: Take a pentagon with all diagonals drawn, as in A331929. Then T(n,k) = number of k-sided polygons in that figure for k = 3, 4, ..., n+5.
%C A331939 See the links in A331929 for images of the pentagons.

%e A331939 A pentagon with no other points along its edges, n = 1, contains 10 triangles, 1 pentagon and no other n-gons, so the first row is [10,0,1,0]. A pentagon with 1 point dividing its edges, n = 2, contains 120 triangles, 40 quadrilaterals, 10 pentagons and no other n-gons, so the second row is [120, 40, 10, 0, 0].
