%N A331867 Numbers n for which R(n) + 3*10^floor(n/2-1) is prime, where R(n) = (10^n-1)/9 (repunit: A002275).
%C A331867 The corresponding primes are a subsequence of A105992: near-repunit primes.
%C A331867 In base 10, R(n) + 3*10^floor(n/2-1) has ceiling(n/2) digits 1, one digit 4, and again floor(n/2-1) digits 1. For odd and even n, the digit 4 is just to the right of the middle of the number.
%C A331867 For odd n = 2m + 1, f(n) = R(n) + 3*10^floor(n/2-1) is divisible by 3, 7 or 13 when m is congruent 1 or 4, 3 or 5, resp. 0 or 2 (mod 6): there can't be an odd term.
%C A331867 For even n = 2m, f(n) is divisible by 3 or 7 when m is congruent to 0 or 3, resp. 1 or 2 (mod 6). When m = 6k + 4, then f(n) is prime for k = 5 and 437 (and no further k <= 600), and divisible by 23 or 53 when k is congruent to 10 (mod 11) resp. 3 (mod 13). When m = 6k + 5, f(n) is prime for k = 457 and 591 and no other value up to 600, and divisible by 23, 47, 53, 97, 163, 181, 859, ... for k congruent to 5 (mod 11), 11 (mod 23), 5 (mod 13), 0 (mod 32), 13 (mod 27), 26 (mod 30), 3 (mod 13), ..., respectively.
