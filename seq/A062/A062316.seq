%N A062316 Neither the sum or difference of 2 squares.
%C A062316 Elements of A022544 congruent to 2 (mod 4).
%C A062316 Union of numbers congruent to 6 mod 8 (A017137) with numbers of the form 2 * A084109(n). - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Jan 21 2007
%C A062316 Explanation: odd numbers are equal to the difference between two successive squares and among even numbers, multiples of 4 are of the form (k+2)^2-k^2, thus odd numbers and multiples of 4 are not in the sequence. Conversely, a difference of 2 squares cannot equal 2 (mod 4), thus this sequence contains the integers of the form 4k+2 that are in A022544 (not the sum of two squares); among integers of form 4k+2, this sequence contains all the integers of the form 8n+6 (A017137) that are not the sum of 2 squares because they have at least one prime factor congruent to 3 (mod 4) to an odd power; it also contains integers of the form 8n+2 = 2(4n+1) with 4n+1 not the sum of two squares, which is sequence A084109. - _Jean-Christophe Hervé_, Oct 24 2015

%F A062316 a(n) == 2 (mod 4). Subsequence of A016825 (non-differences of squares). All first differences are either 4 or 8, each of which occurs infinitely often. - _David W. Wilson_, Mar 09 2005

%e A062316 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, 46, ... are in the sequence because they equal 6 (mod 8).
%e A062316 42 = 2*3*7, 66 = 2*3*11, 114 = 2*7*11 are also in the sequence: of the form 2*(4n+1) with 4n+1 not the sum of 2 squares.
