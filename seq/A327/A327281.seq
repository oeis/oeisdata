%N A327281 Numbers less than the maximum possible determinant A301371(8)=27296640 not occurring as determinant of an 8 X 8 matrix whose entries are a permutation of the multiset {1^8,..,8^8}.
%C A327281 The sequence terms are based on numerical results. No proof for the non-existence of a matrix with given determinant value less than Gasper's upper bound (see Corollary 3 in Sigg) is known. The number of sequence terms is <= 205426. Candidates for a continuation of the sequence are provided as external file.
