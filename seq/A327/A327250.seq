%N A327250 Numbers k such that s(k) = s(k+1), where s(k) is A059975.
%C A327250 Madeleine Farris named these numbers "Euler-totient Ruth-Aaron numbers" (in analogy to the Ruth-Aaron numbers, A039752). She proved that the number of terms <= x is O(x*(log(log(x))^4)/(log(x))^2) and that the sum of their reciprocals is bounded.
