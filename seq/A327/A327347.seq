%N A327347 The 54 prime dates of each year of the form concatenate(day,month) with leading zero for months 1, 3, 7, 9 (no leading zero for days).
%C A327347 All these dates come from January, March, July, September and  November, sorted this d.m way, with 11, 9, 9, 13 and 12 dates, respectively, summing to 54. Note that all September dates without leading zero of month m = 9 from A327346 survive after inserting the 0. The November dates coincide, of course.
