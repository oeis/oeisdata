%N A327346 The 74 prime dates of each year of the form concatenate(day,month) without leading zeros for month (and day), sorted by date, including duplicates.
%C A327346 All these prime dates come from January, March, July, September and November, in the form d.m with no 0 in front of the months m = 1, 3, 7, and 9, with 16, 17, 16, 13 and 12 dates, respectively, which sum to 74.
%C A327346 There are just two duplicates, 211 (Jan. 21 and Nov. 2) and 311 (Jan. 31 and Nov. 3).
