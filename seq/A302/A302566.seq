%N A302566 a(n) is the least positive integer not yet in the sequence in which the largest digit of a(n-2) appears among its digits, and a(n) cannot share digits with a(n-1); a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2.
%C A302566 The only pairs of consecutive numbers are 1, 2; 3, 4; 5, 6; 7, 8.
%C A302566 The 2-digit numbers that are not in the sequence are 12, 21, 34, 43, 56, 65, 89, 98 (78 and 87 do appear at n = 76 and n = 78, respectively).
%C A302566 The last 2-digit number to appear is 91 at n = 113.
%C A302566 Starting from a(73) = 79, the first term of alternating terms must contain 9, and the second term must contain 8.
%C A302566 If the initial terms of this sequence are swapped (by defining a(1)=2 and a(2)=1) then the resulting sequence is identical to this for n>12. - _R. J. Cano_, Apr 13 2018

%e A302566 a(4) = 22 since it contains the largest digit from a(2) = 2, and can't be 12 since the digit 1 appears in a(3) = 10.
