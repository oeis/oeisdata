%N A302140 Numbers n with the property that for every m coprime to n, there are solutions to x^(psi(n)/ord(m,n)) == m (mod n), where psi(n) = A002322(n) and ord(m,n) is multiplicative order of m modulo n.
%C A302140 Contains A033948 as a subsequence.
%C A302140 n cannot be divisible by 16. If n is divisible by 4 (but not by 16), all odd prime factors of n must be == 3 (mod 4). If an odd number n is in this sequence, so is 2n.
%C A302140 Decompose the multiplicative group of integers modulo n as a product of cyclic groups C_{k_1} x C_{k_2} x ... x C_{k_m}, where k_i divides k_j for i < j, then n is a term if and only if gcd(k_i,k_j/k_i) = 1 for i < j. - _Jianing Song_, Apr 29 2018
%C A302140 Terms < N become more and more sparse as N increases. The number of terms below 100, 1000, 10000 and 100000 are 73, 539, 4238 and 35559, respectively. - _Jianing Song_, Sep 05 2018

%e A302140 A002322(21) = 6, and 21 is in this sequence because for every m coprime to 21, x^(6/ord(m,21)) == m (mod 21) has solutions (e.g., ord(4,21) = ord(16,21) = 3 and we have 2^2 == 4 (mod 21), 4^2 == 16 (mod 21); ord(8,21) = ord(13,21) = ord(20,21) = 2 and we have 2^3 == 8 (mod 21), 19^3 == 13 (mod 21), 20^3 == 20 (mod 21)). Also, the multiplicative group of integers modulo 21 is isomorphic to C_2 x C_6, and since gcd(2,6/2) = 1, 21 is a term.
%e A302140 A002322(15) = 4, and 15 is not in this sequence because ord(11,15) = 2, but x^2 == 11 (mod 15) has no solution. Also, the multiplicative group of integers modulo 15 is isomorphic to C_2 x C_4, and since gcd(2,4/2) = 2, 15 is not a term.
