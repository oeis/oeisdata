%S A140955 0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,38
%N A140955 Even integers that do not have at least two partitions into 2 distinct primes.
%C A140955 If A056636(3) = 128 (as is conjectured), then 38 is the last term in the sequence. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Sep 07 2022
%e A140955 8 is a term because 3+5 is the only sum of primes = 8.
%e A140955 16 is not in the sequence because 16 = 3+13 and 5+11.
%e A140955 The only ways to express 10 as a sum of two unordered primes are 3+7 and 5+5. In one of the sums the primes are distinct. Thus, 10 is in this sequence. - _Tanya Khovanova_, Sep 07 2022
