%N A140831 Numbers in whose canonical prime factorization the powers of the primes do not form an increasing sequence.
%C A140831 Previous name was: Let p^b(n,p) be the largest power of the prime p that divides n. The integer n is included if the list of p^b(n,p)'s, where each p is a distinct prime divisor of n, arranged by size of each p^b(n,p) is not in the same order as the list of p^b(n,p)'s arranged by size of each prime p.
%C A140831 This sequence contains no squarefree integers.
%C A140831 90 is the smallest integer in this sequence but not in sequence A126855.
%C A140831 The number of terms < 10^n: 0, 12, 151, 1575, 16154, 161630, 1617052, ..., . - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Aug 31 2008
%C A140831 If k is in the sequence, then all powers of k are in the sequence. - _Mike Jones_, Jun 16 2022
%C A140831 If k is in the sequence then k*A020639(k)^m is in the sequence for m >= 0. - _David A. Corneth_, Jun 16 2022
%C A140831 Conjecture: There are infinitely many terms k such that k+1 is also a term. - _Mike Jones_, Jun 18 2022

%e A140831 The prime factorization of 90 is, when arranged by size of the distinct primes, 2^1 * 3^2 * 5^1. Since 3^2 is > 5^1, even though 5 > 3, 90 is in the sequence.
