%N A140834 Primes that are the sum of at most four nonzero 4th powers.
%C A140834 This sequence was checked by _T. D. Noe_, who had supplied the b-list for A004833. A037896 is a subset of {Primes that are the sum of at exactly 2 nonzero 4th powers}, itself a subset of A002645 Quartan primes: primes of the form x^4 + y^4, x>0, y>0.
%F A140834 A000040 INTERSECTION A004833. {A133740 = Primes that are the sum of at exactly 4 nonzero 4th powers} UNION {A085318 = Primes that are the sum of at exactly 3 nonzero 4th powers} UNION {A002645 = Primes that are the sum of at exactly 2 nonzero 4th powers}.
