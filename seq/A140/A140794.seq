%N A140794 One of the four smallest counterexamples to the conjecture that the cardinality of the sumset is less than or equal to the cardinality of the difference set of every finite set of integers.
%C A140794 This sequence is the reflection of A102282: a(n) = 14 - A102282(9-n).
%C A140794 Keywords: sum-dominant sets, MSTD sets.
%C A140794 A set with more sums than differences is called an MSTD set. Hegarty has constructed many such examples.
%C A140794 Comment from _N. J. A. Sloane_, Mar 10 2013: Out of the 2^n subsets S of [0..n-1], let
%C A140794 AG(n) = number of S with |S+S|>|S-S|,
%C A140794 AE(n) = number of S with |S+S|=|S-S|,
%C A140794 AL(n) = number of S with |S+S|<|S-S|.
%C A140794 A140794 says AG(n) = 0 for n <= 14. These three sequences are respectively A222807, A118544, A222808.

%e A140794 Let A = {0, 2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14}. Then the cardinality of the sumset, |A + A| = 26, while the cardinality of the difference set, |A - A| = 25.
