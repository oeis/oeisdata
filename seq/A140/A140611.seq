%N A140611 Consecutive N at which the prime running totals of prime factors in composites are found.

%F A140611 Compute prime factors (without multiplicity) of consecutive composite N. Maintain a running sum of these prime factors. Whenever the running total at N is prime, add to the sequence.
%e A140611 a(2)=6 because when N=6 the sum of composite prime factors is 7 and this total is prime (nonprime totals are not in this sequence). The prime factor (without multiplicity) of the first composite 4 is 2; the second composite is 6 with prime factors 3 and 2, so 2+2+3=7, the prime sum of prime factors at N=6.
