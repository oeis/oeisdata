%N A140172 Powerful happy numbers; if a prime p divides n then p^2 must also divide n and also n must have trajectory under iteration of sum of squares of digits map includes 1.
%C A140172 For n=10^x such that x is an integer greater than 1, n is both powerful and happy.

%e A140172 2 --> 4 --> 16 --> 37 --> ... --> 4, which repeats with period 8, so never reaches 1, so 2 (and 4, 16 etc.) are unhappy.
%e A140172 7 --> 7^2=49 --> 4^2+9^2=97 --> 9^2+7^2=130 --> 1^2+3^2+0^2=10 --> 1^2+0^2=1
%e A140172 However, 7 divides by 7 and not 7^2.
%e A140172 32 --> 3^2+2^2=13 --> 1^2+3^2=10 --> 1^2+0^2=1
%e A140172 and 32 divides by 2 (and no other prime number) and by 2^2. So 32 is powerful and happy
