%N A140531 Concatenate subsequences 0, 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^k.
%C A140531 A sequence B is called a reluctant sequence of sequence A, if B is triangle array read by rows: row number k coincides with first k elements of the sequence A. Sequence A140531 is the reluctant sequence of A131577. - _Boris Putievskiy_, Dec 12 2012
