%N A063769 Aspiring numbers: numbers whose aliquot sequence terminates in a perfect number.
%C A063769 There are many numbers whose aliquot sequences have not yet been completely computed, so this sequence is not fully known. In particular, 276 may, perhaps, be an element of this sequence, although this is very unlikely.
%C A063769 Numbers less than 1000 whose aliquot sequence is not known that could possibly be in this sequence are: 276, 306, 396, 552, 564, 660, 696, 780, 828, 888, 966, 996. - _Robert Price_, Jun 03 2013
%D A063769 No number terminates at 28, the second perfect number.

%e A063769 The divisors of 95 less than itself are 1, 5 and 19. They sum to 25. The divisors of 25 less than itself are 1 and 5. They sum to 6, which is perfect.
