%N A278243 Filter-sequence for Stern polynomials: Least number with the same prime signature as A260443(n).
%C A278243 This sequence can be used for filtering certain Stern polynomial (see A125184, A260443) related sequences, because it matches only with any such sequence b that can be computed as b(n) = f(A260443(n)), where f(n) is any function that depends only on the prime signature of n (some of these are listed under the index entry for "sequences computed from exponents in ...").
%C A278243 Matching in this context means that the sequence a matches with the sequence b iff for all i, j: a(i) = a(j) => b(i) = b(j). In other words, iff the sequence b partitions the natural numbers to the same or coarser equivalence classes (as/than the sequence a) by the distinct values it obtains.
%C A278243 Some of these are listed on the last line ("Sequences that partition N into ...") of Crossrefs section.

%Y A278243 Cf. A046523, A260443.
%Y A278243 Cf. also A278222, A278226, A278234, A278235, A278236, A278261.
%Y A278243 Sequences that partition or seem to partition N into same or coarser equivalence classes: A002487, A126606, A277314, A277315, A277325, A277326, A277700, A277705.
%Y A278243 The following are less certain: A007302 (not proved, but the first 10000 terms match), A072453, A110955 (uncertain, but related to A007302), A218799, A218800.
%Y A278243 Note that the base-2 related sequences A069010 and A277561 (= 2^A069010(n)) do not match, although at first it seems so, up to for at least 139 initial terms. Also A028928 belongs to a different family.
