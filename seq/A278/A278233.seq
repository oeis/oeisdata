%N A278233 Filter-sequence for GF(2)[X]-factorization: sequence that gives the least natural number with the same prime signature that (0, 1)-polynomial encoded in the binary expansion of n has when it is factored over GF(2).
%C A278233 a(n) = the least number with the same prime signature as A091203(n).
%C A278233 This sequence works as an A046523-analog in the polynomial ring GF(2)[X] and can be used as a filter which matches with (and thus detects) any sequence in the database where a(n) depends only on the exponents of irreducible factors when the polynomial corresponding to n (via base-2 encoding) is factored over GF(2). These sequences are listed in the Crossrefs section, "Sequences that partition N into ...".
%C A278233 Matching in this context means that the sequence a matches with the sequence b iff for all i, j: a(i) = a(j) => b(i) = b(j). In other words, iff the sequence b partitions the natural numbers to the same or coarser equivalence classes (as/than the sequence a) by the distinct values it obtains.

%F A278233 a(n) = A046523(A091203(n)) = A046523(A091205(n)) = A046523(A235042(n)). [Because of the "sorting" essentially performed by A046523, any map from GF(2)[X] to Z can be used, as long as it is fully (cross-)multiplicative and preserves also the exponents intact.]
%F A278233 Other identities. For all n >= 1:
%F A278233 a(A014580(n)) = 2.
%F A278233 a(n) = a(A057889(n)) = a(A193231(n)).
%F A278233 a(A000695(n)) = A278238(n).
%F A278233 a(A277699(n)) = A278239(n).
%e A278233 3 is "11" in binary, encodes polynomial x + 1, and 7 is "111" in binary, encodes polynomial x^2 + x + 1, both which are irreducible over GF(2). We can multiply their codes with carryless multiplication A048720 as A048720(3,7) = 9, A048720(9,3) = 27, A048720(9,7) = 63. Now a(27) = a(63) because the exponents occurring in both codes 27 and 63 are one 1 and two 2's, and their order is not significant when computing prime signature. Moreover a(27) = a(63) = 12 because that is the least number with a prime signature (1,2) in the more familiar domain of natural numbers.
%e A278233 a(25) = 2, because 25 is "11001" in binary, encoding polynomial x^4 + x^3 + 1, which is irreducible in the ring GF(2)[X], i.e., 25 is in A014580, whose initial term is 2.
