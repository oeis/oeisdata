%N A278341 a(n) is the number of decompositions of n into unordered form p + c*q, where p, q are terms of A274987 and the difference of trits for p and q is no more than 1, c=1 for even n-s and c=2 for odd n-s.
%C A278341 p=q is allowed.
%C A278341 It is conjectured that this sequence has only 208 zero terms listed in sequence A278342.
%C A278341 This sequence is tested up to n=200000 without more zero terms.
%C A278341 a(n) <= A276520(n).

%e A278341 For n=6, c=1, 6=3+3, 3=10 in balanced ternary(BT).  3 is a 2 trits BT number. 2-2=0<1, so this one counts, a(6)=1;

%e A278341 For n=20, c=1, 20=3+17=7+13.  For 3 and 17 pair, 3=10(BT), 17=1T0T(BT), the difference of trits of these two primes is 2. This does not count.  For 7 and 13 pair, 7=1T1(BT), 13=111(BT), the difference of trits of these two primes is 0.  This is counted.  So a(20)=1;

So a(29)=2.
