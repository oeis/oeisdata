%N A224953 Number of ways a digit can be appended or prepended to n and form a prime.
%C A224953 The prime number may be formed by adding a digit either before or after n, though only odd numbers can become prime by having digits added before n.
%C A224953 Appending a zero before n produces a prime if and only if n is prime. Conversely, for all prime numbers p, a(p) > 0.
%C A224953 In theory, a maximum of 7 digits could be added before any n, and 3 of the odd digits after n in cases where [10*n, 10*n+9] contains a number that is a factor of 3, 5 and 7 (the three single-digit odd primes). In practice, it appears that all 10 possibilities are never realized. There are 9 possibilities for n = {1, 3, 7, 19}.
%C A224953 The only example of a prime being formed two different ways is for n = 1, which can become 11 if a 1 is appended to either the front or the back. These are naively counted as two distinct alternatives.
%C A224953 The term a(29587) is the first occurrence of 10. The primes are 29587, 129587, 329587, 429587, 729587, 929587, 295871, 295873, 295877, and 295879. This is the only occurrence of 10 for n < 10^8. - _T. D. Noe_, Apr 21 2013

%e A224953 a(0) = 4 because there are 4 ways to concatenate a digit to 0 to produce a prime number: 02, 03, 05, and 07.
%e A224953 a(3) = 9 because a digit can be concatenated to 3 in 9 ways to produce a prime number: 03, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83, 31, and 37.
