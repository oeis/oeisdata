%N A224771 Numbers that are the sum of 3 distinct and primitive nonzero squares.
%C A224771 This sequence gives the increasingly ordered numbers m which satisfy A224772(m) > 0.
%C A224771 This sequence is a proper subsequence of A004432. The first imprimitive members of A004432 are 56, 84, 104, 116, 120, 140, 152, 164, 168, 180, 184, 196, 200, ...

%F A224771 a(n) is the n-th largest number m which satisfies:  m = a^2 + b^2 + c^2, with integers a, b, and c, 0 < a < b < c, and gcd(a,b,c) = 1. Such a solution is denoted by the triple (a, b, c).
%e A224771 The first triples (a, b, c) are:
