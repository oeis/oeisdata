%N A139124 Starting from 1, at any step count the appearances of k, where k ranges from the highest number to 1.
%e A139124 Start from 1. There is just one 1. So the sequence becames 1,1. Then count two 1s.
%e A139124 So we have 1,1,2. Then one 2 and two 1 -> 1,1,2,1,2. Then two 2 and three 1 -> 1,1,2,1,2,2,3. Then one 3, three 2, three 1 -> 1,1,2,1,2,2,3,1,3,3. Then three 3, three 2 and four 1 -> 1,1,2,1,2,2,3,1,3,3,3,3,4. And so on.
