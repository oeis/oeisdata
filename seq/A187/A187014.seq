%N A187014 Number of isomorphism classes of simply embedded (i.e., loop-free and without parallel edges bounding a disk) bipartite quadrangulations of RP^2 of minimum degree 3 with n nodes and n-1 faces.
%C A187014 Also the number of isomorphism classes of homologically trivial basic nets on RP^2 with n-1 nodes and n faces.
%C A187014 Also the number of isomorphism classes of simple quadrangulations of the sphere of minimum degree 3 with 2n nodes and 2n-2 faces which admit an orientation reversing involution without fix nodes and fix edges such that the bipartite coloring is preserved under the involution.
