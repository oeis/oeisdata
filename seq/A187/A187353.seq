%N A187353 Number of Possible Ways to Fill Out NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament Office Pool by Year, 1939-2011
%C A187353 The number a(n) is 2^(k-1) where k is the number of teams in the tournament in year n. The sequence includes any play-in games in preliminary rounds but does not include regional or national third place games.
%C A187353 The number of teams year by year is as follows (source: Wikipedia, detailled list in the b-file):
%C A187353 1939-1950: eight teams; 1951-1952: 16 teams; 1953-1974: varied between 22 and 25 teams; 1975-1978: 32 teams; 1979: 40 teams; 1980-1982: 48 teams; 1983: 52 teams (four play-in games before the tournament); 1984: 53 teams (five play-in games before the tournament); 1985-2000: 64 teams; 2001-2010: 65 teams (with an opening round game to determine whether the 64th or 65th team plays in the first round); 2011-future: 68 teams (four play-in games before the tournament, the nominal first round).
%C A187353 An office pool is where people try to predict the outcome of every single NCAA Tournament game before it starts. The probability of doing so perfectly by randomly choosing is 1/a(n).
