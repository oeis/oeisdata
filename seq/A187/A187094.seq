%N A187094 Good primes (version 3): p such that p-1 has a prime factor between (log p)^2 and 2 (log p)^2.
%C A187094 The notation can be generalized: call n an (a,b)-good number if n-1 has a prime factor in [a * log(p)^2, b * log(p)^2]. In that case these are (1,2)-good primes.
%C A187094 Related to AKS-class primality proving: in particular, these primes can be directly (that is, without an ECPP reduction) proved prime by Cheng's version of AKS in time O((log n)^(4+eps)).
%C A187094 Cheng conjectures that there is a positive constant lambda such that the fraction of primes in (n - 2 sqrt(n) + 1, n + 2 sqrt(n) + 1) that are members of this sequence is greater than lambda/log log n for all sufficiently large n.  If it exists, lambda <= (log 2)/2 = 0.346....

%F A187094 a(n) ~ n log n log log n / log 2.  More generally, Cheng proves that there are pi(x) log(b/a)/(2 log log x) * (1 + O(1/log log x)) (a,b)-good primes up to x.
%e A187094 log(23)^2 is about 9.8, so 23 is good if 22 has a prime factor between 10 and 19 inclusive.  11 | (23 - 1) so 23 is a member of this sequence.
