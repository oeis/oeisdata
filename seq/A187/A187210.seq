%N A187210 Q-toothpick sequence (see Comments for precise definition).
%C A187210 We define a "Q-toothpick" to be a quarter-circle. The length of a Q-toothpick is equal to Pi/2 = 1.570796...
%C A187210 In order to construct this sequence we use the following rules:
%C A187210 - Each new Q-toothpick must lie on the square grid (or circular grid) such that the Q-toothpick endpoints coincide with two opposite vertices of a unit square.
%C A187210 - Each exposed endpoint of the Q-toothpicks of the old generation must be touched by the endpoints of two q-toothpicks of new generation without creating a corner or vertex between these three arcs such that the couple of new Q-toothpicks should look like a "gullwing".
%C A187210 Note that in the Q-toothpick structure sometimes there is also an internal growth of the Q-toothpicks.
%C A187210 The sequence gives the number of Q-toothpicks in the structure after n stages. A187211 (the first differences) gives the number of Q-toothpicks added at n-th stage.
%C A187210 Note that the structure of the Q-toothpick cellular automaton contains distinct types of geometrical figures, for example: circles, diamonds, hearts, heads or flower vases (which appears only on the main diagonal) and also an infinity family of objects (blobs) where every object is a closed region which contains 2^k virtual circles with radius 1 and 2^k-1 virtual diamonds, for example: a 2 X 2 object is a closed region which contains exactly four virtual circles and three virtual diamonds, a 2 X 4 object is a closed region which contains exactly 8 virtual circles and 7 virtual diamonds, etc. Note that a "heart" can be considered a 1 X 2 object which contains two virtual circles and a virtual diamond. What is the better name for these figures? Note that there is a correspondence between this last family of objects and the squares and rectangles of the hidden crosses in the toothpick structure of A139250. For more information about the connection with the toothpick sequence see A139250, A160164 and A187220.
%C A187210 It appears that the number of hearts present in the n-th generation equals the number of rectangles of area = 2 present in the (n-2)nd generation of the toothpick structure of A139250, assuming the toothpicks have length 2, if n >= 3 (see also A188346 and A211008). - _Omar E.

%C A187210 From _Omar E. Pol_, Jan 23 2016: (Start)
%C A187210 Consider the initial Q-toothpick with the virtual center at (0,0) and its endpoints at (0,1) and (1,0).
%C A187210 If n is a power of 2 plus 2 and n >> 1 then the structure of this C.A. essentially looks like a square which contains four parts (or sectors) as follows:
%C A187210 1) NW quadrant, but whose origin is at (-1,1). In this quadrant the number of Q-toothpicks after n generations equals the number of toothpicks in the toothpick structure of A139250 after n-2 generations, if n >= 2. Note that here the toothpick sequence A139250 is represented with Q-toothpicks arranged in an asymmetric structure.
%C A187210 2) SE quadrant, but whose origin is at (1,-1). This quadrant is a reflected copy of the NW quadrant, hence the number of Q-toothpicks after n generations equals A139250(n-2), n >= 2, the same as in the NW quadrant.
%C A187210 3) SW quadrant, but with the origin in the first quadrant at (1,1). In this quadrant the number of Q-toothpicks after n generations is 1 + A267694(n-1), n >= 1.
%C A187210 4) NE quasi-quadrant. In this sector the number of Q-toothpicks after n-generations is A267698(n-2) - 2, if n >= 6. (End)
%C A187210 After the first few generations the behavior is similar to the Gullwing cellular automaton of A187220, but the growth is faster than A187220 and thus it's much faster than A139250. For an animation see Applegate's The movie version in the Links section. - _Omar E. Pol_, Sep 13 2016
