%N A187067 Let i be in {1,2,3} and let r >= 0 be an integer. Let p = {p_1, p_2, p_3} = {-2,0,1}, n = 2*r + p_i and define a(-2)=0. Then, a(n) = a(2*r + p_i) gives the quantity of H_(7,3,0) tiles in a subdivided H_(7,i,r) tile after linear scaling by the factor x^r, where x = sqrt(2*cos(Pi/7)).
%C A187067 Theory. (Start)
%C A187067 1. Definitions. Let T_(7,j,0) denote the rhombus with sides of unit length (=1), interior angles given by the pair (j*Pi/7,(7-j)*Pi/7) and Area(T_(7,j,0)) = sin(j*Pi/7), j in {1,2,3}. Associated with T_(7,j,0) are its angle coefficients (j, 7-j) in which one coefficient is even while the other is odd. A half-tile is created by cutting T_(7,j,0) along a line extending between its two corners with even angle coefficient; let H_(7,j,0) denote this half-tile. Similarly, a T_(7,j,r) tile is a linearly scaled version of T_(7,j,0) with sides of length x^r and Area(T_(7,j,r)) = x^(2*r)*sin(j*Pi/7), r>=0 an integer, where x is the positive, constant square root x = sqrt(2*cos(j*Pi/7)); likewise let H_(7,j,r) denote the corresponding half-tile. Often H_(7,i,r) (i in {1,2,3}) can be subdivided into an integral number of each equivalence class H_(7,j,0). But regardless of whether or not H_(7,j,r) subdivides, in theory such a proposed subdivision for each j can be represented by the matrix M=(m_(i,j)), i,j=1,2,3, in which the entry m_(i,j) gives the quantity of H_(7,j,0) tiles that should be present in a subdivided H_(7,i,r) tile. The number x^(2*r) (the square of the scaling factor) is an eigenvalue of M=(U_1)^r, where
%C A187067   U_1= (0 1 0)
%C A187067        (1 0 1)
%C A187067        (0 1 1).
%C A187067 2. The sequence. Let r>=0, and let C_r be the r-th "block" defined by C_r = {a(2*r-2), a(2*r), a(2*r+1)}. Note that C_r - C_(r-1) - 2*C_(r-2) + C_(r-3) = {0,0,0}, with C_0 = {a(-2),a(0),a(1)} = {0,0,1}. Let n = 2*r + p_i. Then a(n) = a(2*r + p_i) = m_(i,3), where M = (m_(i,j)) = (U_1)^r was defined above. Hence the block C_r corresponds component-wise to the third column of M, and a(n) = m_(i,3) gives the quantity of H_(7,3,0) tiles that should appear in a subdivided H_(7,i,r) tile. (End)
%C A187067 Combining blocks A_r, B_r and C_r, from A187065, A187066 and this sequence, respectively, as matrix columns [A_r, B_r, C_r] generates the matrix (U_1)^r, and a negative index (-1)*r yields the corresponding inverse [A_(-r), B_(-r), C_(-r)] = (U_1)^(-r) of (U_1)^r. Therefore, the three sequences need not be causal.
%C A187067 Since a(2*r-2) = a(2*(r-1)) for all r, this sequence arises by concatenation of third-column entries m_(2,3) and m_(3,3) from successive matrices M = (U_1)^r.
%C A187067 a(2*n) = A006053(n+1), a(2*n+1) = A028495(n).
