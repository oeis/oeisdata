%N A100671 A Graham-Pollak-like sequence with multiplier 3 instead of 2.
%C A100671 When the multiplier in the recurrence is 2, we have the Graham-Pollak sequence, where there is a remarkable exact explicit formula for a(n) in terms of the union of the set of integers and the set of integer multiples of Sqrt(2). As Weisstein summarizes Borwein & Bailey: "It is not known if sequences such as a(n) = Floor(Sqrt(3*a(n-1)*(a(n-1)+1))) have corresponding properties." This sequence is the given one, with a(0) = 1. Through n=40, the primes are when n = 1, 3, 6, 9, 14, 25, 28, 29. Through n=40, the semiprimes are when n = 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 21, 22, 26, 27, 30, 31, 38.

%F A100671 a(0) = 1, a(n) = Floor(Sqrt(3*a(n-1)*(a(n-1)+1))).
%e A100671 a(9) = 193 because a(8) = 111; so a(9) = Floor(Sqrt(3*111*(111+1))) = floor(sqrt(37296)) = 193, which happens to be prime.
