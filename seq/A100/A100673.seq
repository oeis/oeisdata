%N A100673 A Graham-Pollak-like sequence with cube root instead of square root.
%C A100673 When the multiplier in the recurrence is 2 and the recurrence has two terms inside a square root, we have the Graham-Pollak sequence, where there is a remarkable exact explicit formula for a(n) in terms of the union of the set of integers and the set of integer multiples of Sqrt(2). As Weisstein summarizes Borwein & Bailey: "It is not known if sequences such as ... a(n) = a(n) = Floor((2*a(n-1)*(a(n-1)+1)*(a(n-1)+2))^(1/3)) have corresponding properties." This sequence is the given one, having the multiplier in the recurrence as 2 and three terms inside a cube root and with a(0) = 1. Through n=50, the primes are when n = 1, 2, 3, 6, 13, 20, 21, 24, 25, 31. Through n=50, the semiprimes are when n = 4, 7, 9, 10, 19, 23, 32, 34, 36, 40, 42, 47, 49.

%e A100673 a(6) = 11 because a(5) = 8; so a(6) = Floor((2*8*(8+1)*(8+2))^(1/3))
%e A100673 = floor(1440^(1/3)) = 11, which happens to be prime.
%e A100673 a(45) = 119209 because a(44) = 94616, so a(45) = Floor((2*94616*(94616+1)*(94616+2))^(1/3)) = floor(1694094050176992^(1/3)) = 119209 = 23 * 71 * 73, which happens to be a 3-brilliant number.
