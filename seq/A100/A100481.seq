%F A100481 a(n) = A006530(n + A000720(n)) = greatest prime factor in (n + A000720(n)).
%e A100481 a(1) = 1 = A006530(1+0).
%e A100481 a(3) = 5 because 3 + pi(3) = p + number of primes less than or equal to 3, of which there are 2 (namely 2 and 3) hence a(3) = 3 + 2 = 5. This is prime, hence equal to its greatest prime factor. a(5) = 2 because 5 + pi(5) = 5 + 3 = 2 * 2 * 2 hence the greatest prime factor is 2.
