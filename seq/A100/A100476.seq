%N A100476 a(1)=a(2)=a(3)=a(4)=1; for n > 4: a(n) = A000720(a(n-1)+a(n-2)+a(n-3)+a(n-4)).
%C A100476 For n > 29 we have a(n) = 24. Starting with other values of a(1), a(2), a(3), a(4) what behaviors are possible? The sequence is in any case bounded. If for some k a(k)+a(k+1)+a(k+2)+a(k+3) > 400, then a(k+4) is smaller than the average of a(k),a(k+1), a(k+2) and a(k+3), which means that the sequence will always stick at a single integer after some point or go into a loop. Are there values a(1), a(2), a(3), a(4) such that the sequence would indeed exhibit cyclic behavior?
