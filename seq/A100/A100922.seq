%N A100922 n appears A000120(n) times (appearances equal number of 1-bits).
%C A100922 Clearly every positive integer appears at least once in this sequence.

%F A100922 a(n) = the least k such that A000788(k) > n. - _Antti Karttunen_, Jun 20 2014
%e A100922 The binary representation of 16 is 10000, which has one 1-bit (and four 0-bits), hence 16 appears once in this sequence (and four times in A100921).
