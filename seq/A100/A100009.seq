%N A100009 Iterated pentatope numbers, starting with Ptop(2) = 5. The pentatope number of the pentatope number of the pentatope number ... of 2.
%C A100009 The next term has 90 digits.
%C A100009 This can been seen as a 4-dimensional parallel to the 3-dimensional A099179 (Iterated tetrahedral numbers) and 2-dimensional A007501 Iterated triangular numbers. This need not start at 2. For example, starting at a(0) = 17, which is not a pentatope number, we have a(1) = Ptop(17) = 17*(17+1)*(17+2)*(17+3)/24 = 4845 = 3 * 5 * 17 * 19 {which happens to be the product of two twin-prime pairs); a(2) = Ptop(Ptop(17)) = Ptop(4845) = 4845*(4845+1)*(4845+2)*(4845+3)/24 = 22988020743780.

%F A100009 a(1) = 2; for n>1, pentatope number Ptop(n) = n*(n+1)*(n+2)*(n+3)/4!; for k>1, a(k+1) = Ptop(a(k)) = (a(k))*(a(k)+1))*(a(k)+2))*(a(k)+3))/24.
%e A100009 a(3) = 1088430 because a(0) = 2 is the seed for this instance of the more general recurrence, a(1) = Ptop(2) = 2*(2+1)*(2+2)*(2+3)/24 = 5; a(2) = Ptop(Ptop(2)) = Ptop(5)= 5*(5+1)*(5+2)*(5+3)/24 = 70; a(3) = Ptop(Ptop(Ptop(2))) = Ptop(70)= 70*(70+1)*(70+2)*(70+3)/24 = 1088430.
