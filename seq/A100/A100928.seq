%N A100928 Number of partitions of n into parts free of odd octagonal (star) numbers: k(3k-2) and the only number with multiplicity in the unrestricted partitions is the number 2 with multiplicity of the form :4k+2l, k a positive integer and l=0,1.
%C A100928 This is also the inverted graded of the generating function for partitions of n into parts free of octagonal numbers.
