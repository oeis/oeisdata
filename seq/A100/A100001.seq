%N A100001 Number of self-dual combinatorial configurations of type (n_3).
%C A100001 A combinatorial configuration of type (n_3) consists of an (abstract) set of n points together with a set of n triples of points, called lines, such that each point belongs to 3 lines and each line contains 3 points.
%C A100001 Interchanging the roles of points and lines gives the dual configuration. A configuration is self-dual if there is an isomorphism from it to its dual.

%e A100001 Example: the Fano plane is the only (7_3) configuration and is self-dual. It contains 7 points 1,2,...7 and 7 triples, 124, 235, 346, 457, 561, 672, 713.
%e A100001 The unique (8_3) configuration is also self-dual. It consists of the triples 125, 148, 167, 236, 278, 347, 358, 456.
