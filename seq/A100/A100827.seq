%N A100827 Highly cototient numbers: records for a(n) in A063741.
%C A100827 Each number k on this list has more solutions to the equation x - phi(x) = k (where phi is Euler's totient function, A000010) than any preceding k except 1.
%C A100827 This sequence is a subset of A063741. As noted in that sequence, there are infinitely many solutions to x - phi(x) = 1. Unlike A097942, the highly totient numbers, this sequence has many odd numbers besides 1.
%C A100827 With the expection of 2, 4, 8, all of the known terms are congruent to -1 mod a primorial (A002110). The specific primorial satisfying this congruence would result in a sequence similar to A080404 a(n)=A007947[A055932(n)]. - Wilfredo Lopez (chakotay147138274(AT)yahoo.com), Dec 28 2006
%C A100827 Because most of the solutions to x - phi(x) = k are semiprimes p*q with p+q=k+1, it appears that this sequence eventually has terms that are one less than the Goldbach-related sequence A082917. In fact, terms a(108) to a(176) are A082917(n)-1 for n=106..174. [_T. D. Noe_, Mar 16 2010] This holds through a(229).  [_Jud McCranie_, May 18 2017]

%e A100827 a(3) = 8 since x - phi(x) = 8 has three solutions, {12, 14, 16}, one more than a(2) = 4 which has two solutions, {6, 8}.
