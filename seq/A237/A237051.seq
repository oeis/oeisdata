%N A237051 Smallest set of distinct numbers such that the sum of their reciprocals is 1 and each number is of the form p^i*q^j where p and q are distinct primes and i and j are positive.
%C A237051 In other words, smallest set of distinct numbers in A007774 (i.e., numbers that are divisible by exactly 2 different primes) whose reciprocals sum to 1.
%C A237051 This is the only set of 20 distinct numbers with the specified property. (The sum of the reciprocals of the first 19 numbers that are divisible by exactly 2 different primes is 229926/230945, which is less than 1, so no set of fewer than 20 such numbers can have reciprocals that sum to 1.)
%C A237051 There exist 8 such sets of 21 numbers, and 218 such sets of 22 numbers.
%C A237051 For a set of 25 distinct numbers having the specified property, see A201463.
%C A237051 The Magma program (as of Feb 12 2014) is very fast at n=20, but very slow if n is changed to a value of 22 or larger. The main opportunity for improving its efficiency may be in the way it handles the search for the last two terms of a set, given the first n-2 terms at the current point in the search tree. Specifically, if the remainder r = 1 - (1/i[1] + 1/i[2] + ... + 1/i[n-2]) is close to zero, e.g., 10^-8, then it tests about 10^8 values of i[n-1] (from about 10^8 to about 2*10^8), instead of applying some smarter approach that makes use of the factorization of the denominator of the remainder r.
