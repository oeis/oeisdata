%N A237130 Number of ordered ways to write n = k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that both {3*k - 1, 3*k + 1} and {phi(m) - 1, phi(m) + 1} are twin prime pairs, where phi(.) is Euler's totient function.
%C A237130 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 8.
%C A237130 (ii) Any integer n > 6 can be written as k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that both {prime(k), prime(k) + 2} and {phi(m) - 1, phi(m) + 1} are twin prime pairs.
%C A237130 (iii) Each n = 12, 13, ... can be written as p + q (q > 0) with p, p + 6, phi(q) - 1 and phi(q) + 1 all prime.
%C A237130 (iv) If n > 2 is neither 10 nor 430, then n can be written as k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that both {3k - 1, 3*k + 1} and {6*m - 1, 6*m + 1} are twin prime pairs.
%C A237130 Note that each part of the above conjecture implies the twin prime conjecture.
