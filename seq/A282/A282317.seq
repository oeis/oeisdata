%N A282317 Lexicographically earliest infinite cubefree word over alphabet {0,1}.
%C A282317 From _Jean-Paul Allouche_, May 25 2017: (Start)
%C A282317 Proof that this sequence exists:
%C A282317 Consider the set of all infinite binary sequences equipped with the usual topology (two sequences are "close" if they coincide on a long prefix). This is a metrizable topology which--essentially--makes this set "equal" to the real numbers in [0,1) ("essentially" because of the ambiguity caused by the fact that positive rational numbers k/2^m have two representations, ending with all 0's or all 1's).
%C A282317 The subset F of all infinite cubefree binary sequences is nonempty (it contains the Thue-Morse sequence A010060). It admits an infimum (having a lower bound in the whole set) which may or may not be cubefree.
%C A282317 To prove that this infimum is cubefree, it would be enough to prove that the set F is (topologically) closed. Alternatively, that its complement G, the set of sequences containing at least one cube, is an open set.
%C A282317 Take a binary sequence S containing a cube. Take a prefix of S that is long enough to contain this cube. All sequences with this prefix contain a cube and are close to S, and provide an open interval of noncubefree sequences centered at S. So G is an open set. QED (End)
%C A282317 10000 terms were computed using depth-first search with backtracking with 200 guard elements. The observed backtracking depths were small, strongly suggesting that all 10000 terms are correct. - _David W. Wilson_, Feb 11 2017
%C A282317 However, at present it is only a conjecture that the terms from 1000 to 10000 are correct. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, May 22 2017
%C A282317 I reproduced these 10000 terms with an algorithm that did not need any backtracking in the strict sense (cf. PARI code), as follows: (1) Start with S := 0. (2) Let W := S. (3) While SW is not cubefree, "increment" W (see below for details) at the point where the first cube in SW ends. (4) Let S := SW and goto (2). By "increment W at the point k" we mean: if W[k]=1 then decrease k until W[k]=0; now set W[k]=1 and delete all further digits (i.e., W := concat(W[1..k-1],1)). If this never results in a maximal cubefree word S (cf. A282133), then the algorithm yields the correct sequence (minimal and cubefree by construction and infinite by hypothesis). - _M. F. Hasler_, May 20 2017
%C A282317 To prove that the terms of an initial segment W of this sequence computed in this way (which ensures that it is the lex-order earliest cubefree sequence of that length) are correct, it is sufficient to show that W can be extended to an infinite cubefree sequence. This is the case if WT is cubefree, where T = A010060 is the Thue-Morse sequence (or any left-truncation of it, also cubefree and overlap-free). Following an idea of _N. J. A. Sloane_, we show that it is sufficient to check that WT' is cubefree, where T' is T truncated to twice the length of W. (This is indeed the case for the first 999 terms.) Indeed, if WT = XXX... with length(X) > length(W), let X = WY, then WT = WYWYWY... so T = YWYWY... = ABABA... with YW =: AB, length(A) = 1, which is impossible since T is known to be overlap-free (see A010060). Thus, if WT starts with a cube XXX, then length(X) <= length(W). To cover the case where the cube XXX would start later in WT, repeat the reasoning for all left-truncations of W. This completes the proof. (If length(W) = n, we need only to check for cubes of length <= 3n starting at the beginning, of length <= 3(n-1) starting at the second digit of W, etc.) - _M. F. Hasler_, May 21 2017 and May 22 2017
%C A282317 See A286940 for the lengths of the words W successively appended by this algorithm. These lengths L are sufficient to reconstruct the words W = concat(S[0..L-2],1) (except for the first two 1's which correspond to W = 0). There we give a pattern for that sequence of lengths conjectured to be valid for about 65*3^8 terms, corresponding to more than 10^7 terms of A282317. Beyond that point the behavior is unclear. - _M. F. Hasler_, May 21 2017
%C A282317 Following earlier comments, the 10001 terms in the b-file were verified by appending a bit more than twice as many terms of the Thue-Morse sequence, and verifying that the derived sequence was still cubefree. However, starting with the first or second term of A010060 did not give a cubefree sequence. Starting with the third term did. That's enough, since any left truncation of Thue-Morse is also cubefree and overlap-free, which are the crucial properties needed by the proof. The same is true if the original algorithms here are run to produce 4 million terms (although in that case verification works starting with the first Thue-Morse term). - _Tim Peters_, Jul 16 2025
