%N A282231 First term of A175304 with a given prime signature.
%C A282231 Conjecturally the sequence is infinite.
%C A282231 The sequence of the corresponding prime signatures begins  p, p*q, p^2*q, p^2*q*r, p*q*r, p^3*q^2, p^5*q, p^3, p^7, ...
%C A282231 There are no prime signatures of perfect squares. Indeed, A175304 contains no squares (see our comment there). - _Vladimir Shevelev_, Feb 10 2017
%C A282231 A037916(a(n)) gives a numerical version of the second comment: {1,11,21,211,111,32,51,3,7,31,311,221,511,321,72,2111,61,2211,1111,...}, however due to the limitations of the notation in A037916, we cannot represent a(20)=2048 since A037916(2^10)=digit 10, which is not a valid decimal digit. A037916 is useful if we refrain from rendering the multiplicities as decimal digits, instead maintaining them as a list. - _Michael De Vlieger_, Feb 10 2017

%e A282231 From _Michael De Vlieger_, Feb 10 2017: (Start)
%e A282231 a(1) = 3 since 3 is prime and has a prime signature of "1"; it is the very first prime in the sequence, followed by {5,11,17,29,41,...}. The prime signature "1" is the first distinct signature encountered in the sequence
%e A282231 a(2) = 6 since it is a squarefree semiprime with prime signature "11"; it is the very first such number in the sequence, followed by {10,22,34, 35,51,...}. This prime signature is the second distinct signature encountered in the sequence.
%e A282231 a(3) = 12 since it has a prime signature of "21" (i.e., the exponents of  p^2*q^1, A037916(12)=21) and this signature is the third distinct signature encountered. It is the very first number with this signature, followed by {44,92,147,236,332,...}. (End)
