%N A179309 The smallest number that has more copies of some digit than any previous number in the sequence.
%C A179309 These are, for each digit d and each natural number k, the smallest positive number in which the digit d appears k (or more) times, in numerical order. They are all numbers with all digits repeated except numbers of the form 10^m.
%C A179309 If we started with 0 the term 10 would be missed and all other terms would be the same.
%e A179309 100 is included because no previous term contains two 0's. 111 is included because no previous term contains more than 2 1's. Every number between 101 and 110 inclusive is omitted because each contains at most 2 1's (no more than 11) and at most 1 of any other digit (no more than 2 thru 10).
