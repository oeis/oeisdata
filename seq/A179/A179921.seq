%N A179921 a(n) = prime(n) if n<=3; for n>3, a(n) is the smallest prime >a(n-1), such that the denominator of fraction (a(n-1)-a(n-2))/(a(n)-a(n-1)) did not appear earlier.
%C A179921 Using Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions, it is easy to prove that the sequence is infinite.  The sequence of the corresponding denominators begins with 2,1,3,5,4,11,7,6,17, ...
%e A179921 The first four terms 2,3,5,13 give three denominators: 2,1,3. Then a(5) is not in {17, 19}, since (13-5)/(17-13) = 2/1, (13-5)/(19-13) = 4/3 and denominators 1 and 3 already appeared earlier. Since (13-5)/(23-13) = 4/5 and 5 is not yet in the denominator sequence, a(5) = 23.
