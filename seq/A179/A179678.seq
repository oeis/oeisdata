%N A179678 Primes which are the fifth element of a generalized Wieferich sequence.
%C A179678 A generalized Wieferich sequence is an increasing sequence of primes p[1],p[2],... such that a=p[n+1] is a Wieferich prime to base b=p[n], i.e., a^(b-1)=1 (mod b^2).
%C A179678 The present sequence is a subsequence of A179400. The numbers 728437, 1051139, 144 449603 and 5176 948723 found by M. Kamada and D. Broadhurst are also in this sequence. The last two numbers are even 7th elements of a generalized Wieferich sequence, cf. the link.

%e A179678 The smallest generalized Wieferich sequence of length 5 is (3, 11, 71, 331, 359): 3^10=1 (mod 11^2), 11^70=1 (mod 71^2), 71^330=1 (mod 331^2) and 331^358=1 (mod 359^2). Therefore, a(1)=359.
%e A179678 It happens that after a(2)=6211, there are four subsequent elements of A179400, namely 13477, 19069, 20431 and 22567, which are also member of a sequence of length 5 and thus in this sequence.
