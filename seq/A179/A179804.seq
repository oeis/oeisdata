%N A179804 Number of letter combinations on a standard telephone keypad represented by the digits in n.
%F A179804 If n contains a 1 or 0, then a(n) = 0
%F A179804 Otherwise, if d=number of digits in n, then a(n)=3^d.
%e A179804 If any digit in n is 1 or 0, then a(n) = 0 because telephone keys 1 and 0 represent no letters
%e A179804 a(2)=3 because "3" on a keypad can represent "d", "e", or "f".
%e A179804 a(23)=9 because "2" on a keypad represents the letters "abc" and "3" represents "def", and there are 9 possible combinations taking one letter from each of these sets in this order.
