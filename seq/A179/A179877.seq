%e A179877 From _Michael De Vlieger_, Jul 30 2018: (Start)
%e A179877 10 is in the sequence since the reduced residue system of 10 is {1, 3, 7, 9} and that of 11 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, the mean of the squares of these 2 systems, divided by the mean of the systems themselves, is 7 in both cases.
%e A179877 6 is not in the sequence, because though the RRS of 6, {1, 5}, and that of 7, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, have the same contraharmonic mean of 13/3, it is not integral. (End) [corrected by _Hilko Koning_, Aug 20 2018]
