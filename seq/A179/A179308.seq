%N A179308 List of positive integers, omitting any number n if another number with the same set of digits as n has already been listed.
%C A179308 Numbers 1 to 10 are all new sets of digits. 11 is omitted because its digit set {1} is the same as that of 1. The following numbers are included, until 21 which has the same digit set as 12, and 22 which has the same set as 2.
%C A179308 This sequence is of course finite and has 1022 terms; the number of possible digit sets excluding the empty set and {0}.
