%N A153250 Array A(x,y): A(0,0), A(1,0), A(0,1), A(2,0), A(1,1), A(0,2), ... formed by growing a bud (a single V-node) on the y-th leaf of the binary tree A014486(x).
%C A153250 Note: the leaf positions are indexed so that the rightmost one in the tree is leaf 0, etc., up to the leftmost one, which is the leaf with index A072643(x). In this manner, terms on each row stay in monotone order. Row n (starting from row 0) contains A072643(n)+1 nonzero terms and then an infinite number of zeros after that. A153249 gives only the nonzero terms. Can be used to compute "fleeing tree" sequences for Catalan bijections. See comments at A153246.

%e A153250 By inserting a bud (\/) at leaf position 1 of binary tree A014486(2) (leaf positions numbered for clarification):

%e A153250 which is the 5th binary tree encoded by A014486. Thus A(2,1)=5.
