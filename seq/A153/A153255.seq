%N A153255 Arises in enumerating orientable small covers over cubes.
%C A153255 A small cover, as defined by Davis and Januszkiewicz, is an n-dimensional closed smooth manifold M with a smooth action of standard real torus (Z_2)^2 action such that the action is locally isomorphic to a standard action of (Z_2)^2 on R^n and the orbit space M/(Z_2)^2 is a simple convex polytope. For instance, RP^n with a natural action of (Z_2)^2 is a small cover over an n-simplex. In general, real toric manifolds, the set of real points of a toric manifold, provide examples of small covers.
%C A153255 Hence we may think of small covers as a topological generalization of real toric manifolds in algebraic geometry. Small covers over hypercubes are known to be real Bott manifolds, which is obtained as iterated RP^1 bundles starting with a point, where each fibration is the projectivization of a Whitney sum of two real line bundles [Masuda and Panov]. Choi found the 1-1 correspondence between the set of real Bott manifolds and the set of acyclic digraphs in a previous work.
