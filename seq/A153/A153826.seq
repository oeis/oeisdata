%N A153826 Index sequence to A089840: positions of bijections that preserve A127301 (the non-oriented form of general trees).
%C A153826 These terms form a subgroup in A089840 (A089839). Because A127301 can be computed as a fold and most of the recursive derivations of A089840 (i.e., tables A122201-A122204, A122283-A122290, A130400-A130403) are also folds, this sequence also gives the indices to those derived tables where bijections preserving A127301 occur.
