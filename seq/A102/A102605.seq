%N A102605 Number of ways of writing 2n+1 as p+q+r where p,q,r are primes with p < q < r, offset=0.
%C A102605 The graph of this function shows two main branches, each with further subdivisions. It seems that the main branches result from the fact that values a(3k+1) are in the mean roughly 30% lower than values a(3k) and a(3k+2). This can be explained by the fact that the sum of 3 primes (with equal probability of being congruent to 1 or to 5 mod 6) is congruent to 3 (mod 6) in only 2 out of 8 cases, and congruent to 1 or to 5 (mod 6) in 3 out of 8 cases, for each of these two residues. Analyzing the frequencies of the possible residues mod 30 explains the further sub-branches: A sum of 3 primes is congruent to 1, 3, ..., 29 (mod 30) in (42, 29, 33, 39, 29, 36, 36, 30, 39, 30, 39, 30, 36, 37, 27) out of 512 cases. - _M.
