%N A102911 Number of unlabeled (and unrooted) trees on 2n nodes with a bicentroid.
%C A102911 A tree has either a center or a bicenter and either a centroid or a bicentroid. (These terms were introduced by Jordan.)
%C A102911 If the number of edges in a longest path in the tree is 2m, then the middle node in the path is the unique center, otherwise the two middle nodes in the path are the unique bicenters.
%C A102911 On the other hand, define the weight of a node P to be the greatest number of nodes in any subtree connected to P. Then either there is a unique node of minimal weight, the centroid of the tree, or there is a unique pair of minimal weight nodes, the bicentroids.
%C A102911 A 2n-node tree with a bicentroid consists of two n-node rooted trees with the roots joined by an edge.

%F A102911 a(n) = r(n)*(r(n)+1)/2 where r(n) = A000081(n) is the number of rooted trees on n nodes.
%F A102911 Let f(n) = a(n/2) if n is even, = 0 otherwise. Then f(n) + A027416(n) = A000055(n).
