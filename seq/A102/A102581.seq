%N A102581 Numbers n such that denominator of Sum_{k=0 to 2n+1} 1/k! is (2n+1)!/2.
%C A102581 The denominator of Sum_{k=0 to m} 1/k! is m!/d, where d = A093101(m). If m > 1 is odd, say m = 2n+1, then d is even. n is a member when d = 2. If m > 3 and m = 3 (mod 4), so that n > 1 is odd, then d is divisible by 4. So except for 1 the members are even.
