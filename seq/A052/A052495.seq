%N A052495 Take n-th prime p, let P = all primes having same digits; a(n) = q-p where q is smallest prime in P >p if q exists; otherwise a(n) = p-r where r is largest prime in P <p if r exists; otherwise a(n) = 0.
%C A052495 The primes in P are required to have the same number of digits as p; thus internal 0's must remain internal 0's.
%e A052495 a(41)=18 because the 41st prime is 179. The primes having these digits are 179, 197, 719 and 971. The distance from 179 to 197 = 18.
