%N A373610 Positive integers that cannot be written as a sum of a practical number and an octagonal number.
%C A373610 Somu and Tran (2024) conjectured that there are finitely many such integers. It was also conjectured that 4005819 is the largest such integer. This conjecture was checked up to 10^8.
