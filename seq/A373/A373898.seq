%e A373898 a(1) = 1 because the only divisor of 1 is 1 and (1/1)^1 (mod (1/1 + 1)) = 1;
%e A373898 a(6) = 1 because (6/1)^1 mod (6/1 + 1) = 6 (not equal to 1), (6/2)^2 mod (6/2 + 2) = 4 (not equal to 2), (6/3)^3 mod (6/3 + 3) = 3 and (6/6)^6 mod (6/6 + 6) = 1 (not equal to 6), where 1, 2, 3 and 6 are divisors of 6.
