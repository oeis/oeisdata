%N A373597 Non-multiples of 3 whose multiplicies of prime factors of types 3m-1 and 3m+1 are both multiples of 3.
%C A373597 A multiplicative semigroup: if m and n are in the sequence, then so is m*n. This is generated by semigroups A373589 and A373590.

%e A373597 20 = 2*2*5 has 0 primes of type 3m+1 (A002476) and 3 primes of type 3m-1 (A003627) in its prime factorization, and as 0 and 3 are both multiples of 3, 20 is included as a term.
%e A373597 21952 = 2^6 * 7^3 is term because there are 3 primes of type 3m+1 and 6 primes of type 3m-1, and as 6 and 3 are both multiples of 3, 21952 is included as a term.

%Y A373597 Cf. A002476, A003627, A373596 (characteristic function).
%Y A373597 Subsequences: A373589 and A373590.
%Y A373597 Subsequence of A001651, and of A145784.
%Y A373597 Subsequence of the sequences A369659, A369644, A327863, A289142, A373385, and some of their intersections: A373473, A373475, A373478, A373492, A373494.
%Y A373597 Differs from A373492 for the first time at n=91, where a(91) = 1325, which skips the value A373492(91) = 1323 present in A373492.
%Y A373597 Cf. also A046337 (roughly analogous sequence for k=2, instead of k=3).
