%N A373487 Numbers k such that A276085(k) is a multiple of A003415(k), where A003415 is the arithmetic derivative and A276085 is the primorial base log-function.
%C A373487 Sequence A276086(A380527(.)) when sorted into ascending order gives the {intersection of this sequence with A048103}. As A380527 is a subsequence of A381035, this intersection is by the given correspondence a subsequence of (primes U A080364). Note that this applies also to the third known nonsquarefree term of this sequence, 855523 (= 67 * 113^2), which indeed disproves the conjecture I had made in A380527, while the first two nonsquarefree terms 28 and 33212 are both multiples of 4, and thus outside of the intersection.- _Antti Karttunen_, Jan 28 2026
