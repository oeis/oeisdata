%N A373599 Numbers k such that k and A327860(k) are both multiples of 3, where A327860 is the arithmetic derivative of the primorial base exp-function.
%C A373599 If x and y are terms and if A329041(x,y) = 1 (i.e., when adding x and y together will not generate any carries in the primorial base), then x+y is also a term. This follows from the quasi-exponential nature of A276086 and because A373144 is a multiplicative semigroup.

%e A373599 18 = 3*6 is included, because also A327860(18) = 75 is a multiple of 3.
%e A373599 222 = 3*74 is included, because also A327860(222) = 135 is a multiple of 3.
%e A373599 240 = 3*80 is included, because also A327860(240) = 18 is a multiple of 3.
%e A373599 258 = 3*86 is included, because also A327860(258) = 8025 is a multiple of 3. Note that A049345(18) = 300, A049345(240) = 11000, and A049345(240+18) = 11300, so the sum in this case is carry-free (cf. the comment).
%e A373599 2556 = 3*852 is included, because also A327860(2556) = 2556 is a multiple of 3 (see also A328110 and A373144).

%Y A373599 Intersection of A008585 and A369654.
%Y A373599 Differs from A008600 (multiples of 18) for the first time at a(13) = 222, which is not a multiple of 18.
