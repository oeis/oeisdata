%N A167526 Prime factors of the speed of light in a vacuum, c = 299792458 (m/s).
%C A167526 Note that each prime factor of 299792458 appears with multiplicity 1 in this number.
%C A167526 Giving the speed of light in km/s or cm/s would yield the same prime factors > 5. If time is measured in hours, or distance in miles, feet, inches or similar, then the numerical value of c is no longer an integer.
%F A167526 299792458 = 2 * 7 * 73 * 293339.
