%N A167783 Numbers that are repdigits with length > 2 in more than one base.
%C A167783 Definition requires "length > 2" because all numbers n > 2 are trivially represented as "11" in base n-1.

%C A167783 0 = 00 = 000 = 0000 = 00000 = 000000 = 0000000 = 00000000 = ... in any positional number representation (includes fixed base radix b > 1, mixed base radix with each b_i > 1, i >= 0, such as factorial and primorial based radix...)
%C A167783 The sequence definition should be read as:
%C A167783 Nonnegative integers that are repdigits with length > 2 in more than one fixed base radix b > 1.
%C A167783 Considering all fixed and mixed base radix would include many more nonnegative integers (but not the integers 1 to 6) which are repdigits with length > 2 in more than one radix. (End)

%C A167783 In this sequence data, the first number which is repdigit, with length > 2, in more than two bases is the twelfth Mersenne number 4095 with four Brazilian representations: M_12 = 4095 = 111111111111_2 = 333333_4 = 7777_8 = (15 15 15)_16.
%C A167783 The Mersenne number M_15 is the first number which is repdigit in exactly three bases with M_15 = 32767 = 111111111111111_2 = 77777_8 = (31 31 31)_32.
%C A167783 Only two numbers are repunits in more than one base: the Mersenne primes 31 and 8191 (Examples and A119598).
%C A167783 Some numbers are once repunit and once multiple of a Brazilian prime such that Mersenne number M_9 = 511 = 7 * 73 = 111111111_2 = 7 * 111_8 = 777_8.
%C A167783 Some numbers are once repunit and once multiple of a composite repunit such that Mersenne number M_6 = 63 = 3 * 21 = 111111_2 = 3 * 111_4 = 333_4.
%C A167783 Some numbers are repdigits in two different bases: 546 = 666_9 = 222_16. (End)
