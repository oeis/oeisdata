%N A167198 Fractal sequence of the interspersion A083047.
%C A167198 As a fractal sequence, if the first occurrence of each term is deleted, the remaining sequence is the original. In general, the interspersion of a fractal sequence is constructed by rows: row r consists of all n, such that a(n)=r; in particular, A083047 is constructed in this way from A167198.
%C A167198 a(n-1) gives the row number which contains n in the dual Wythoff array A126714 (beginning the row count at 1), see also A223025 and A019586. - _Casey Mongoven_, Mar 11 2013

%F A167198 Following is a construction that avoids reference to A083047.
%F A167198 Write initial rows:
%F A167198 Row 1: .... 1
%F A167198 Row 2: .... 1
%F A167198 Row 3: .... 2..1
%F A167198 Row 4: .... 2..3..1
%F A167198 For n>=4, to form row n+1, let k be the least positive integer not yet used; write row n, and right before the first number that is also in row n-1, place k; right before the next number that is also in row n-1, place k+1, and continue. A167198 is the concatenation of the rows. (If "before" is replaced by "after", the resulting fractal sequence is A003603, and the associated interspersion is the Wythoff array, A035513.)
%e A167198 To produce row 5, first write row 4: 2,3,1, then place 4 right before 2, and then place 5 right before 1, getting 4,2,3,5,1.
%Y A167198 Cf. A003603, A083047, A035513, A000045.
