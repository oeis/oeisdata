%N A392185 Smallest number of sets a(n) in a collection C of sets of size n such that C does not have Property B (see comments).
%C A392185 A collection has Property B if the elements of the sets in C can be partitioned into sets such that every set in C contains at least 1 element from each set.
%C A392185 Given a finite set X, a collection C of subsets of X has Property B if X can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets Y and Z such that every set in C meets both Y and Z.
%C A392185 Any hypergraph whose vertices can be 2-colored such that every hyperedge contains at least one vertex of each of the 2 colors has Property B.
%C A392185 29 <= a(5) <= 51, last improved in 2020 (from a lower bound of 28 to 29).
