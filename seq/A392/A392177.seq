%N A392177 Consider the square spiral with its cells numbered starting at 0, as in A308884 and A274641. Two players, Black and Red, take turns. When it is Black's turn, he places a knight at the smallest unoccupied cell not attacked by an existing Red knight, and when it is Red's turn, she places a knight at the smallest unoccupied cell not attacked by an existing Black knight. Sequence lists squares occupied by a Black knight.
%C A392177 There is a subtle point about the definition. Because the players take turns in placing a knight, the spiral is not filled in consecutively. To obtain the sequence, one must first fill in the whole spiral, and then return to the start, and record the Black knights that are encountered as one walks along the spiral.
%C A392177 This is a problem, not a game. The (unsolved) problem is to explain the extraordinary patterns formed by the Black and Red knights (see the links).
%C A392177 By considering the evolution of the spiral as the number of terms grows, it seems clear that, apart from narrow bands along the x- and y-axes, the upper half-plane will be occupied by red knights, and the lower half-plane by black nights.
%C A392177 The reason for this is unclear.
