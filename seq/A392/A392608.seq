%N A392608 Number of nonzero digits in the primorial base representation of n (A049345) such that their corresponding radix prime divides n.
%C A392608 For n > 0, a(n) is the number of prime factors p of n such that the primorial base representation of n (A049345) has a nonzero digit under that same radix p, which is equal to the number of prime factors of n that divide A276086(n) [or vice versa], i.e., number of prime factors shared by n and A276806(n).

%F A392608 a(0) = 0, for n > 0, a(n) = Sum_{p|n, p prime} [A276086(n) == 0 (mod p)], where [ ] is the Iverson bracket.
%F A392608 a(n) = A001221(A324198(n)).
%F A392608 a(n) = A267263(n) - A392610(n).
%F A392608 For n > 0, a(n) = A001221(n) - A392609(n).
%e A392608 a(0) = 0 as A049345(0) = 0 does not contain any nonzero digits.
%e A392608 a(1) = 0 as A049345(1) = 1, so the corresponding radix prime is 2, and 2 does not divide 1.
%e A392608 a(15) = 2 as A049345(15) = 211, with the corresponding radix primes 2, 3 and 5, of which 3 and 5 divide 6.
%e A392608 a(140) = 2 as A049345(140) = 4310, with nonzero digits having radix primes 3, 5, 7, of which the two latter divide 140 = 2^2 * 5 * 7.
%e A392608 a(392) = 1 as A049345(392) = 16010 [thus A276086(392) = 11^1 * 7^6 * 3^1], with nonzero digits having radix primes 11, 7, 3, of which only 7 divides 392 = 2^3 * 7^2.
