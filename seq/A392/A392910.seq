%N A392910 Semiperfect numbers that cannot be represented as a sum of their nontrivial divisors.
%C A392910 Equivalently, numbers k such that some subset of the numbers {1 <= d < k : d | k}, but no subset of {1 < d < k : d | k} adds up to k.
%C A392910 Equivalently, numbers k such that k is the sum of a subset of its proper divisors, and every such subset must necessarily include the divisor 1.
%C A392910 The sequence could be called 'unit-anchored' (or 1-anchored) semiperfect numbers.
%C A392910 All perfect numbers (A000396) are terms of this sequence, as the sum of their divisors is n.
%C A392910 The sequence is a subsequence of the primitive pseudoperfect numbers (A006036).
%C A392910 The only known odd term is a(161) = 351351 (A122036).

%F A392910 k is term if and only if 1 is element of intersection{ S subset D(n) : n = Sum(S) } where D(n) = {1 <= d < n : d | k}. (Note that this implies the intersection is nonempty, meaning at least one such subset exists.)
%e A392910 k = 20: Proper divisors are {1, 2, 4, 5, 10}. Subset summing to 20 is {10, 5, 4, 1} and every valid subset requires 1.
