%N A392654 Binary-encoded contents of pin 3, after n moves, when moving infinitely many disks in the Tower of Hanoi starting from pin 1, via the optimal algorithm.
%C A392654 Disks are numbered 0,1,2,... with the smallest numbered 0.  Write a(n) in base 2; the powers 2^i appearing therein tells you what disks are on pin 3.  Initially infinitely many disks are on pin 0.
%e A392654 Move 1 moves a disk from pin 1 to pin 2, move 2 moves a disk from pin 1 to pin 3, move 3 moves a disk from pin 2 to pin 3, move 4 moves a disk from pin 1 to pin 2, move 5 moves a disk from pin 3 to pin 1. Since a(4) = 3, pin 2 holds disks 0 and 1 after 4 moves, and since a(5) = 2, pin 2 contains disk number 1 only.
