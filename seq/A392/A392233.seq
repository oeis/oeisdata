%N A392233 Composite numbers (not multiples of 10) whose constant congruence speed equals the product of the constant congruence speeds of all their prime factors.
%C A392233 For the definition of "constant congruence speed", see A373387 and Def. 1.2 (and also Def. 1.1) of "Number of stable digits of any integer tetration" in Links (for all positive integers m > 1 and not a multiple of 10, this corresponds to A373387(m)).
%C A392233 Here, prime factors are considered with their multiplicity (e.g., the prime factors of 75 are 3, 5, and 5 and thus the product of their constant congruence speeds equals 1*2*2=4).
%C A392233 Furthermore, if the product of two positive integers m' and m'' is not divisible by 10, then the constant congruence speed of m'*m'' is necessarily greater than or equal to the minimum of the constant congruence speeds of m' and m'' (see Equation 2.4 of "A Compact Notation for Peculiar Properties Characterizing Integer Tetration" in Links).
%C A392233 By definition, this sequence contains no prime number.

%e A392233 a(2) = 6 since the constant congruence speed of 6 is 1, the constant congruence speed of 2 is 1, the constant congruence speed of 3 is 1 and 1 is equal to 1*1.
