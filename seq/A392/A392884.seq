%N A392884 a(n) is the minimum total surface area of four-element sets of distinct integer-sided cuboids that fill an n X n X n cube.
%C A392884 Total surface area of four-element sets of cuboids is given by the sum of surface area 2*(x*y+y*z+z*x) of each cuboid x X y X z in the set.
%e A392884 According to A384311(3) there are four sets of cuboids in total that fill 3 X 3 X 3 cube:
%e A392884  {(3 X 3 X 2), (3 X 2 X 1), (2 X 1 X 1), (1 X 1 X 1)} with total area = 80,
%e A392884  {(3 X 3 X 2), (3 X 1 X 1), (2 X 2 X 1), (2 X 1 X 1)} with total area = 82,
%e A392884  {(3 X 3 X 1), (3 X 2 X 2), (2 X 2 X 1), (2 X 1 X 1)} with total area = 88,
%e A392884  {(3 X 3 X 1), (3 X 2 X 1), (2 X 2 X 2), (2 X 2 X 1)} with total area = 92.
%e A392884 Therefore a(3) = 80 since the minimum total surface area of the four cuboids is 80.
