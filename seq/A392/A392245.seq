%N A392245 Number computed by Wolfram's 2-state 2-symbol Turing machine 1285 when started with n on the tape.
%C A392245 Used as simple example Turing machine in Wolfram (2026): start the Turing machine with the binary digits of some integer n on its tape. The machine starts in the cell of the least significant bit of n and in state U. Then run the Turing machine, stopping if the Turing machine's head goes further to the right than where it started. The value of the function with input n is then read off from the binary digits that remain on its tape when the Turing machine stops.
%C A392245 The state transitions for machine 1285 are: 1U -> 1UL, 0U -> 0DL, 1D -> 0UL, 0D -> 0DR, where the notation 1U -> 1UL means if the cell under the head is 1 and the head is in the U (up) state, then that cell remains 1, the head remains up, and the head moves to the left.
%C A392245 Also computed by machines 261 and 3333.
%C A392245 From _M. F. Hasler_, Feb 08 2026: (Start)
%C A392245 All terms are multiples of 4, because these TM's can reach position -1 only after having written two zeros on the last two positions of the tape.
%C A392245 These three machines (eventually) overwrite with zeros all cells they visit, but if there are two consecutive bits 0 in the input, they never go further to the left than that. This gives a simple formula for the result: just set to zero all bits of n to the right of the rightmost string of "00" in its binary expansion. (End)
