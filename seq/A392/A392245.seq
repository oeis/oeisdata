%N A392245 Number computed by Wolfram's 2-state 2-symbol Turing machine 1285 when started with n on the tape.
%C A392245 Used as simple example Turing machine in Wolfram (2026): start the Turing machine with the binary digits of some integer n on its tape. The machine starts in the cell of the least significant bit of n and in state U. Then run the Turing machine, stopping if the Turing machine's head goes further to the right than where it started. The value of the function with input n is then read off from the binary digits that remain on its tape when the Turing machine stops.
%C A392245 The state transitions for machine 1285 are: 1U -> 1UL, 0U -> 0DL, 1D -> 0UL, 0D -> 0DR, where the notation 1U -> 1UL means if the cell under the head is 1 and the head is in the U (up) state, then that cell remains 1, the head remains up, and the head moves to the left.
%C A392245 Also computed by machines 261 and 3333.
