%N A392536 a(n) is the smallest number not yet in the sequence that has a prime factor in common with a(n-2) (either 2 or odd) and an odd prime factor in common with a(n-1); a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6 (see comments for details).
%C A392536 The terms in the sequence > a(1) have to be composite since a(n) has to share one common factor with a(n-1) and another one with a(n-2). In the case the factor is the same, it is counted with multiplicity 2.
%e A392536 a(3) = 12 since it has the even prime factor 2 in common with a(1) = 2 and the odd prime factor 3 in common with a(2) = 6.
%e A392536 a(4) = 9 since it has the odd prime factor 3 in common with a(2) = 6 and the odd prime factor 3 in common with a(3) = 12.
