%N A392812 The z values of solutions to x + y = z with x >= y, x and y coprime, and the distinct prime factors of x*y*z are consecutive primes starting with 2.
%C A392812 Also: The z values of solutions to x + y = z with x >= y, x and y coprime, and x*y*z is in A055932.
%C A392812 When A376926(z) = k, then the value z appears k times in the sequence.

%C A392812 For any number m we possible conclude that m is not in the sequence as follows:
%C A392812 If m is 1 then m is not in the sequence.
%C A392812 Let p be the largest prime factor of m. Let pp be the product of primes <= p. Let d be the product of distinct prime factors of m.
%C A392812 The largest value x*y can take is floor(z^2/4). Therefore the largest value x*y*z can take is z*floor(z^2/4). We need pp <= z*floor(z^2/4). Else m can most definitely not be in the sequence.
%C A392812 x, y and z are pairwise coprime. Proof: x and y are coprime by definition. If x and z are not coprime then y = z-x has the same divisor > 1 as x and z have in common and so x and y are not coprime. A contradiction. Equivalently y and z are coprime. (End)

%e A392812 The number 49 appears at here 3 times because A376926(49) = 3, which is because there are 3 ways to write 49 as x + y that satisfy x >= y, x and y coprime, and so that the distinct prime factors of x*y*49 are consecutive primes starting with 2:
%e A392812   45 + 4 = 49 and 45 * 4 * 49 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5 * 7^2.
%e A392812   40 + 9 = 49 and 40 * 9 * 49 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 5 * 7^2.
%e A392812   25 + 24 = 49 and 25 * 24 * 49 = 2^3 * 3 * 5^2 * 7^2.

%e A392812 13 is not in the sequence. If z = 13 then x*y*z <= z*floor(z^2/4) = 546. The largest prime factor of 13 is 13. The product of primes <= 13 is 30030. We have 30030 > 546 so 13 is most definitely not in the sequence.
%e A392812 z = 55 is in the sequence 4 times. We have x*y <= floor(55^2/4) = 756 and x*y*z <= 756*55 = 41580. The largest primorial that is at most 41580 is 30030 whose largest prime divisor is 13. The largest prime factor of 55 is 11. Therefore the distinct prime factors of x*y*z are {2, 3, 5, 7, 11} or {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}.
%e A392812 From z = 55 we get the prime factors 5 and 11. As x, y and z are pairwise coprime {5, 11} is removed from the possible prime sets for x*y*z to find those for x*y. This leaves {2, 3, 7} or {2, 3, 7, 13} as possible prime sets. For any x*y the product of these sets must be a divisor. So if the distinct prime divisors of x*y are {2, 3, 7} then 2*3*7 = 42 is a divisor of x*y.
%e A392812 Therefore the possible values x*y can take if z = 55 are {42, 84, 126, 168, 252, 294, 336, 378, 504, 546, 588, 672, 756}. As z = 55 = x+y we can check each of these numbers m if the solution to x+y = 55 and x*y = m gives a solution using the quadratic formula. It turns out we get solutions for each m in {294, 336, 546, 756} having (x, y) in {(49, 6), (48, 7), (42, 13), (28, 27)} respectively. (End)
