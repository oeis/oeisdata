%N A392178 Consider the square spiral with its cells numbered starting at 0, as in A308884 and A274641. Two players, Black and Red, take turns. When it is Black's turn, he places a knight at the smallest unoccupied cell not attacked by an existing Red knight, and when it is Red's turn, she places a knight at the smallest unoccupied cell not attacked by an existing Black knight. Sequence lists squares occupied by a Red knight.
%C A392178 This is a problem, not a game. The (unsolved) problem is to explain the extraordinary patterns formed by the Black and Red knights (see the links).
