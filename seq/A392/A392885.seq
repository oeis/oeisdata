%N A392885 a(n) is the maximum total surface area of four-element sets of distinct integer-sided cuboids that fill an n X n X n cube.
%C A392885 Total surface area of four-element sets of cuboids is given by the sum of surface area 2*(x*y+y*z+z*x) of each cuboid x X y X z in the set.
%e A392885 According to A384311(3) there are four sets of cuboids in total that fill 3 X 3 X 3 cube:
%e A392885  {(3 X 3 X 2), (3 X 2 X 1), (2 X 1 X 1), (1 X 1 X 1)} with total area = 80,
%e A392885  {(3 X 3 X 2), (3 X 1 X 1), (2 X 2 X 1), (2 X 1 X 1)} with total area = 82,
%e A392885  {(3 X 3 X 1), (3 X 2 X 2), (2 X 2 X 1), (2 X 1 X 1)} with total area = 88,
%e A392885  {(3 X 3 X 1), (3 X 2 X 1), (2 X 2 X 2), (2 X 2 X 1)} with total area = 92.
%e A392885 Therefore a(3) = 92 since the maximum total area of four cuboids is 92.
