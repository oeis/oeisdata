%N A392304 Squares whose sum of prime factors (with multiplicity) is also a perfect square.
%C A392304 A number x = m^2 is in the sequence if sopf(x) is a perfect square, where sopf(k) is the sum of prime factors of k with multiplicity (A001414).
%C A392304 Except for a(1)=1, all values of sopfr(a(n)) are even perfect squares because sopfr(n^2) = 2*sopfr(n).
%C A392304 For any prime p and any positive integer k, the number x = p^(p * (2*k)^2) is a term of the sequence.
%e A392304 a(1) = 1: 1 is a square (1^2) and its sopf is 0 (empty sum), which is 0^2.
%e A392304 a(2) = 4: 4 = 2^2. Prime factors are 2, 2. Sum: 2+2 = 4, which is 2^2.
%e A392304 a(3) = 225: 225 = 15^2. Prime factors are 3, 3, 5, 5. Sum: 3+3+5+5 = 16, which is 4^2.
%e A392304 a(4) = 256: 256 = 16^2 = 2^8. Prime factors are eight 2's. Sum: 2*8 = 16, which is 4^2.
%e A392304 a(5) = 324: 324 = 18^2. Prime factors of 324 are 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3. Sum: 2+2+3+3+3+3 = 16, which is 4^2.
