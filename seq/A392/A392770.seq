%N A392770 a(n) is the smallest number not yet in the sequence that has an odd prime factor in common with a(n-2) and a prime factor (either 2 or odd) in common with a(n-1); a(1) = 3, a(2) = 6 (see comments for details).
%C A392770 Aside from the initial term, the numbers in the sequence have to be composite since a(n) has to share one common factor with a(n-1) and another one with a(n-2). In the case the factor is the same, it is counted with multiplicity 2.
%e A392770 a(3) = 9 since it has the odd prime factor 3 in common with a(1) = 3 and the odd prime factor 3 in common with a(2) = 6.
%e A392770 a(4) = 18 since it has the odd prime factor 3 in common with a(2) = 6 and the odd prime factor 3 in common with a(3) = 9.
%e A392770 a(5) = 12 since it has the odd prime factor 3 in common with a(3) = 9 and the even prime factor 2 in common with a(4) = 18.
