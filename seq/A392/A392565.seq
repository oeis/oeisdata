%N A392565 Positive integers (not multiples of 10) whose constant congruence speed is smaller than the sum of the constant congruence speeds of all their prime factors.
%C A392565 For the definition of "constant congruence speed" (in radix-10), see Def. 1.2 (and also Def. 1.1) of "Number of stable digits of any integer tetration" in Links (for all positive integers m > 1 and not a multiple of 10, this corresponds to A373387(m)).
%C A392565 Here, prime factors are considered with their multiplicity (e.g., the prime factors of 75 are 3, 5, and 5 and thus the sum of their constant congruence speeds equals 1+2+2 = 5).
%C A392565 Furthermore, if the product of two positive integers r and s is not divisible by 10, then the constant congruence speed of r*s is necessarily greater than or equal to the minimum of the constant congruence speeds of r and s.
%C A392565 By definition, this sequence contains no prime number.

%e A392565 a(1)=4 since the constant congruence speed of 4 is 1. 4=2^2, the constant congruence speed of 2 is 1 and 1 < 1+1.
