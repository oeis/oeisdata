%N A392636 Number of graphs with n vertices that have no induced regular subgraph of order 6 or greater.
%C A392636 By Ramsey's Theorem, this sequence eventually becomes zero. It is known that a(20) is large, but it is not known whether a(21) is zero or positive.
%C A392636 For the analogous sequences counting graphs with no induced regular subgraph of order k or greater, the location where the sequence becomes zero is known for all k < 6.
