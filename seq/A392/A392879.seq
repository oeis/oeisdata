%N A392879 Let p = A129252(n), if p = 1, then a(n) = n, otherwise a(n) = n * p^((e%p)-e) * q^floor(e/p), where e is p-adic valuation of n and q is the least prime number greater than p.

%F A392879 A276085(a(n)) = A276085(n).
%e A392879 For n = 12 = 2^2 * 3, the least prime that "overflows" (has an exponent >= the prime itself) is 2, so we divide by 2^(2-(2 mod 2)) and multiply by 3^floor(2/2), i.e., divide by 4 and multiply by 3, to obtain a(12) = 9.
%e A392879 For n = 27 = 3^3, the least prime which overflows is 3, so we divide by 3^(3-(3 mod 3)) and multiply by 5^floor(3/3), i.e., divide by 3^3 and multiply by 5, to obtain a(27) = 5.
%e A392879 For n = 36 = 2^2 * 3^2, the least prime which overflows is 2, so we divide by 2^2 and multiply by 3, to obtain a(36) = 3^3 = 27.
%e A392879 For n = 54 = 2^1 * 3^3, the least prime which overflows is 3, so we divide by 3^(3-(3 mod 3)) and multiply by 5^floor(3/3), i.e., divide by 3^3 and multiply by 5, to obtain a(54) = 2*5 = 10.
%e A392879 For n = 72 = 2^3 * 3^2, the least prime which overflows is 2, so we divide by 2^(3-(3 mod 2)), i.e., by 2^2, and multiply by 3^floor(3/2), i.e., by 3, to obtain a(72) = 54 = 2 * 3^3.
