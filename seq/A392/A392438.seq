%N A392438 2-composable numbers: even numbers k for which k/2 is a sum of the other nontrivial divisors of k.
%C A392438 An integer n > 1 is a term if and only if n is even, and its largest proper divisor L = n/2 can be represented as the sum of some subset of its other nontrivial divisors. A 'nontrivial divisor' d of n is any divisor that is 1 < d < n. Let D_{2}(n) = {1 < d < L : d | n}. Then n is a term if there exists a subset S of D_{2}(n) such that L = Sum(S). Written in this form, n is recognizable as a p-composable number with p = 2, where the case for general p is defined in A392440.
%C A392438 Differs first from A136446 at n = 220, where the first odd semiperfect number 945 (resp. the first odd abundant number) appears in A136446, see A005231.

%e A392438 12 is 2-composable as it can be written as the sum of a subset of its nontrivial divisors, namely as 2 + 4 + 6, and {2, 4} is a subset drawn from divisors strictly smaller than 6.
%e A392438 6 is not 2-composable although it is semiperfect (1 + 2 + 3 = 6).
