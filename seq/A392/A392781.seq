%N A392781 Length of the longest reduced word in the cyclic group C_n.
%C A392781 a(n) is also defined as the diameter of the Cayley graph for C_n.
%C A392781 This sequence is additive with a(1) = 0, a(2^k) = (k + (k mod 2))/2, and a(p^k) = k*(p-1)/2, p an odd prime. To show additivity, let n = k*m, gcd(k,m) = 1. Let w be a reduced word in C_k, v a reduced word in C_m, and let S(C_n) = S(C_k) U S(C_m) be the union of their generating sets. S(C_n) is disjoint by coprimality of k and m. If L(x) is the length of the reduced word x, then L(w*v) = L(w) + L(v), for w*v in C_n. If r and s are the longest words in C_k and C_m respectively, then r*s is the longest word in C_n and L(r*s) = L(r) + L(s).

%e A392781 a(5) = 2 as every reduced word in C_5 is made up of at most 2 letters. Equivalently, a(5) = (5-1)/2 = 2.
%e A392781 a(10) = 3 as every reduced word in C_10 is made up of at most 3 letters. Equivalently, a(10) = a(2*5) = a(2) + a(5) = 1 + (5-1)/2 = 3.
%e A392781 a(36) = 3 as every reduced word in C_36 is made up of at most 3 letters. Equivalently, a(36) = a(2^2) + a(3^2) = 1 + 2*(3-1)/2 = 3.
