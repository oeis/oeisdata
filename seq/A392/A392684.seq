%N A392684 Number of ways to write n as x + y + z with x >= y >= z >= 1 such that lcm(x,y,z) is a product of three consecutive integers.
%C A392684 Conjecture: (i) For any integer k > 2, each integer n >= 2^k - 2 can be written as x_1 + ... + x_k with x_1,...,x_k positive integers such that lcm(x_1,...,x_k) is a product of k consecutive integers.
%C A392684 (ii) For each integer k > 2, let N(k) be the least positive integer N such that any integer n >= N  can be written as x_1 + ... + x_k with x_1,...,x_k positive integers such that lcm(x_1,...,x_k) is a product of k consecutive integers. Then N(3) = 6, N(4) = 13, N(5) = 18, N(6) = 33, N(7) = 40, N(8) = 153 and N(9) = 226.
%C A392684 It seems that for every integer k > 2 any positive integer n < N(k) cannot be written as x_1 + ... + x_k with x_1,...,x_k positive integers such that lcm(x_1,...,x_k) is a product of k consecutive integers.
