%N A392539 a(n) = the least common multiple of all natural numbers k such that phi(k) <= n.
%C A392539 phi(n) = A000010(n). The range of the phi function is A002202; the latter excludes odd numbers > 1 and some even numbers as well, and explains why some terms in this sequence are repeated. The (multi-valued) inverse of the phi function is A032447. Note that in computing the least common multiple for the present sequence, only prime power values of k are required, which makes the search shorter.
%C A392539 All terms of this sequence are the least having that prime signature (A025487).
%C A392539 It appears that log(a(n))/n approaches 1 as n increases without bound.
%e A392539 a(4) = the least common multiple of all natural numbers k such that phi(k) <= 4. The full list of such k is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12}, and the least common multiple of that set is 120.
