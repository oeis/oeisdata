%N A392130 Integers k such that there are i groups of order k+1 up to isomorphism, for i=1,2,3,4,5,6,7.
%C A392130 First 13 terms are all terms up to 5 * 10^14.
%C A392130 Each term is 72 modulo 144.
%C A392130 Let g(k) (= A000001(n)) denote the number of groups with k elements.
%C A392130 The factorization of even k where g(k) = c for small c is very constrained.
%C A392130 This is a subsequence of A392129 (length 6 sequences), which has more comments.
%C A392130 If we write k = 144m + 72, then k+1 = 144m + 73, k+2 = 2(72m + 37), k+4 = 4(36m + 19), and k+6 = 6(24m + 13).
%C A392130 The only way g(k+2) can be 2 is if 72m + 37 is prime (Olsson 2006).
%C A392130 The only way g(k+4) can be 4 is if 36m + 19 is prime (Miller 1932).
%C A392130 The only way g(k+6) can be 6 is if 24m + 13 is prime (Mahmoud 2024).
%C A392130 For g(k+1) to be 1, 144m + 73 must be squarefree (necessary and easy to sieve, but not sufficient).
%C A392130 This sequence is infinite assuming the Bateman-Horn conjecture is true. We can construct a subsequence where the odd k+i also have a nice factorization by restricting k+3 mod 5^2, then k+5 mod 7^4, then k+7 mod 11^4*43^2 (or many other examples). E.g. if k = 233992702112400m + 1301555283912, with all of 233992702112400m + 1301555283913, 116996351056200m + 650777641957, 15599513474160m + 86770352261, 58498175528100m + 325388820979, 682194466800m + 3794621819, 38998783685400m + 216925880653, and 4088422800m + 22741343 prime, then that's a subsequence of this sequence which is infinite assuming Bateman-Horn (these large linear forms show up when we factor out the gcd from k+1, k+2, etc., and the gcds are constructed so that they have the requisite group number, and then we multiply them by a prime that does not interact).

%e A392130 For k = 5973822114120, the factorizations of k+1 thru k+7 are as follows:
%e A392130 5973822114121 = 37 * 109 * 487 * 3041551 (squarefree with no relations p | q - 1, so we have one group per Olsson 2006, namely the cyclic group)
%e A392130 5973822114122 = 2 * 2986911057061 (squarefree with one relation because 2 | 2986911057061 - 1, so we have two groups per Olsson 2006, namely the cyclic group C2p and the dihedral group D2p)
%e A392130 5973822114123 = 3 * 19 * 137 * 764991947 (squarefree with 3 | 19 - 1 and 19 | 764991947 and no other relations, so we have three groups per Olsson 2006)
%e A392130 5973822114124 = 2^2 * 1493455528531 (squarefree besides 2^2, with one relation because 2 | 1493455528531 - 1, so we have four groups per Miller 1932, namely C2 x C2 x Cp, C4 x Cp, C2 x D2p, and D4p)
%e A392130 5973822114125 = 5^3 * 2719 * 17576527 (squarefree besides 5^3, no relations, so we have five groups per Miller 1932, namely C5 x C5 x C5 x C47790576913, C5 x C25 x C47790576913, C125 x C47790576913, (C5 semidirect product C25) x C47790576913, and Heisenburg(Z_5) x C47790576913. The five possibilities for the size 125 subgroup are listed in Conrad, and because 47790576913 is coprime to the size of the automorphism group for each of these, there are no nontrivial semidirect products, just the direct product)
%e A392130 5973822114126 = 2 * 3 * 995637019021 (squarefree with 2 | 3 - 1, 2 | 995637019021 - 1, and 3 | 995637019021 - 1, so we have six groups per Mahmoud 2024)
%e A392130 5973822114127 = 7^2 * 97^2 * 17 * 181 * 4211 (squarefree besides 7^2 and 97^2 with no relations p | q - 1, 7 | 97 + 1, and no other relations p | 7 + 1 or p | 97 + 1, so we have seven groups per Mahmoud 2024)
