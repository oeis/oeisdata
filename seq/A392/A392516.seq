%N A392516 Number of graceful Prüfer codes on n vertices with n-2 in the last position of the code.
%C A392516 Any labeled tree on n vertices admits a unique Prüfer code. A graceful labeling of a tree on n vertices assigns the labels {0, 1, ..., n-1} to the vertices such that the induced edge labels (absolute differences of endpoint labels) are exactly {1, 2, ..., n-1}. This sequence counts the Prüfer codes of gracefully labeled trees on n vertices with n-2 in the last position of the code.

%e A392516 For example, for a(8)=1. By Cayley's formula, there are 8^(8-2) = 262144 distinct Prüfer codes, corresponding bijectively to the 262144 labeled trees on 8 vertices. Among these, only some labelings are graceful.
%e A392516 There are A033472(8) = 752 gracefully labeled trees on 8 vertices. We enumerate all these 752 graceful labelings, compute their Prüfer codes, and count how many of them have n-2 = 6 in the last position of the code. Exactly one such Prüfer code exists: (7, 7, 0, 7, 3, 6). The edges of this graph are: (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (4, 0), (6, 3), (5, 3), (7, 6).
