%N A392319 Palindromes of the form b^k + 1 or b^k - 1, with b, k > 1.
%C A392319 Intersection of A080262 and A002113.
%C A392319 Cunningham numbers that are palindromes.
%C A392319 This sequence has infinitely many terms, since 10^k + 1 and 10^k - 1 are palindromes for all k > 1.
%C A392319 This sequence explores the predecessors and successors of perfect powers. Sequence A075786 gives the perfect powers that are palindromes, where it is conjectured that there are no palindromic perfect powers with prime exponent > 3. Without considering the case when b = 10, this sequence records prime exponents greater than 3, for example, 2^5 + 1 = 33, 3^5 - 1 = 242, and 6^5 + 1 = 7777.
%C A392319 Are there more Cunningham palindromes with prime exponents greater than 3, with b != 10?
%e A392319 323 is a term, it is already a palindrome and furthermore 323 = 18^2 - 1.
