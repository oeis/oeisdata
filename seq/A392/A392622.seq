%N A392622 Lexicographically least increasing sequence of positive integers so that no term is the sum of two consecutive terms, or except for the first term a partial sum of the sequence.
%e A392622 3 is not a term, since 1 and two are the starting numbers, and 1+2=3.
%e A392622 7 is not a term, since 1+2+4 is 7, with 4 being the next of the smallest numbers.
