%N A392655 Binary-encoded contents of pin 2, after n moves, when moving infinitely many disks in the Tower of Hanoi starting from pin 1, via the optimal algorithm.
%C A392655 Disks are numbered 0,1,2,... with the smallest numbered 0.  Write a(n) in base 2; the powers 2^i appearing therein tells you what disks are on pin 2.  Initially infinitely many disks are on pin 0.
%C A392655 The number k appears in this sequence if and only if it appears in A165404.
%e A392655 Move 1 moves a disk from pin 1 to pin 2, move 2 moves a disk from pin 1 to pin 3, move 3 moves a disk from pin 2 to pin 3.   Since a(3) = 0, there are no disks on pin 2 after 3 moves, and since a(4) = 4, pin 2 contains disk number 2 only.
%Y A392655 Cf. A165404, A391638, A392654.
