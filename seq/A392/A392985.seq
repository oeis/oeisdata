%N A392985 Composite numbers, k, whose prime factors, viewed on a log log scale, have a large standard deviation defined with respect to bigomega(k), as specified in the comments.
%C A392985 The complement of A379271 within the composite numbers.
%C A392985 Composite numbers k (written as a product of primes p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_m) such that s( {log(log(p_i)) : 1 <= i <= m} ) >= s( {i : 1 <= i <= m} ), where s is standard deviation and m = bigomega(k).
%C A392985 Loosely described, these are numbers whose prime factors, including repetitions, are relatively far apart. (Note we get the same criterion irrespective of whether s is sample standard deviation or population standard deviation.)
%C A392985 The use of a log log scale relates to the spacing on this scale of factors of large integers. Taking the log twice of the median factors given in A281889, we get 0.094..., 0.665..., 1.803..., 2.775..., ~3.75, ... (noting that the first two values can be seen as affected by "noise" from the small terms 3 and 7).
%C A392985 Proper subset of A024619.
%C A392985 Proper subset of A080259.
%C A392985 The sequence is closed under application of A253550(.). So if we divide a term by its greatest prime factor and multiply by a larger prime we get another term.
%C A392985 Smallest powerful term is a(544653) = A001694(2684) = 1737124 = 1318^2 = 2^2 * 659^2. This term is A001597(1451) = A303606(652), a perfect power k^m with squarefree composite k and m > 1.
%C A392985 Smallest term also an Achilles number is A052486(811731) = 502479065288 = 2^3 * 250619^2.
%C A392985 The first terms divisible by p^k but not p^(k+1) for some prime p exist for all k >= 1, occur in order of k and with p = 2. For k = 1, 2, 3 these are a(1) = 14 = 2^1 * 7, a(36) = 212 = 2^2 * 53, a(22414) = 76696 = 2^3 * 9587. The first term, a(n), with k = 4, has n > 2^20.
%C A392985 The smallest term also in A386762 is 2^4 * prime(7505209077)^2 = 559245523686209129483536.
%C A392985 A term also in A383394 is: 2^6 * (2^A000043(13)-1)^4 = 2^6 * (2^521-1)^4 (659 decimal digits).
