%N A392396 Numbers k whose Collatz trajectory can be used as successive segment lengths of a self-avoiding closed walk in the square lattice, with all adjacent walk segments at right angles to one another.
%C A392396 The number of terms in the trajectory must be even so the final return to the origin makes a right angle there.

%e A392396 14 is a term because its Collatz trajectory of {14, 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1} can be arranged as lengths of successive segments of a self-avoiding closed walk in the square lattice, with all adjacent walk segments at right angles to one another, as alternating x and y moves as follows: [14, 0] + [0, 7] + [22, 0] + [0, 11] + [34, 0] + [0, 17] - [52, 0] + [0, 26] - [13, 0] - [0, 40] - [20, 0] - [0, 10] + [5, 0] - [0, 16] + [8, 0] + [0, 4] + [2, 0] + [0, 1] = [0, 0]. See Links for a graphical representation.
%e A392396 1 is not a term because its trajectory has 1 term and a closed walk of all distinct length segments requires at least 6 terms.
%e A392396 3 is not a term because its trajectory yields an axis that cannot be divided evenly.
%e A392396 6 is not a term because its trajectory has an odd number of terms, which would result in the first and last terms sharing the same orientation.
%e A392396 34 is not a term because the only closed walks that its trajectory can produce are self-intersecting.
