%N A392969 Positive integers whose multiset of digits cannot be reduced to {0} by repeatedly replacing two digits with the digits of their sum, absolute difference, or product.
%C A392969 The sequence is finite and complete. Proof: Any number with a repeated digit is reducible (subtract to get 0, then 0 * x = 0 clears the rest). All C(9,3) = 84 three-element subsets of {1,...,9} are reducible (verified computationally). Any number with more than 3 distinct nonzero digits contains such a subset, so only 1- and 2-digit terms qualify.
%C A392969 Note: Including integer division (where the result is exact) does not change the sequence, so it is excluded from the definition.
%e A392969 12 is in the sequence. Multiset {1,2}: 1+2=3 replaces {1,2} with {3}; |1-2|=1 replaces {1,2} with {1}; 1*2=2 replaces {1,2} with {2}. None yield {0}.
%e A392969 48 is in the sequence. Multiset {4,8}: 4+8=12 replaces {4,8} with {1,2} (see above); |4-8|=4 gives {4}; 4*8=32 gives {3,2}, which also cannot be reduced to {0}.
%e A392969 847 is not in the sequence. Multiset {8,4,7}: 8*4=32 replaces {8,4} with {3,2}, giving {7,3,2}; 7+3=10 replaces {7,3} with {1,0}, giving {2,1,0}; 1*0=0 gives {2,0}; 2*0=0 gives {0}. Reduced.
%e A392969 98 is the largest term.
