%N A392776 a(n) is the number of solutions of (x^2+y^2+z^2)/(x*y + x*z + y*z) = A331605(n), such that 0 < |x| <= |y| <= z <= A331605(n), gcd(|x|,|y|,z) = 1.
%C A392776 It appears that a(n) > 0, n > 2; i.e., if there exist unbounded solutions for some n > 2, then the bounded one exists too.
%e A392776 a(1) = 1, solution is (1,1,1).
%e A392776 a(2) = 0, as potential solutions (0,1,1) and (1,1,4) are out of the bounds.
%e A392776 a(11) = 4, solutions are (-2,3,7), (-2,3,55), (-5,7,22), (-17,30,43), A331605(11) = 62.
%Y A392776 Cf. A331605, A392646.
