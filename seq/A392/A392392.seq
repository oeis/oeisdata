%N A392392 Number of free polyquarcs with n cells.
%C A392392 The cells of a polyquarc are quarter circular arcs of equal radii. Two cells are connected if one end from each meet along a common tangent line head to head, so that no cusp is created at the junction. However, such cusps are allowed to exist provided that the polyquarc is connected via non-cusp junctions.
%C A392392 Cells can be represented as integer points in the plane, with the neighbors of (x,y) being (x,y-s), (x-r,y), (x+r,y-s), (x-r,y+s), where r = (-1)^(x mod 2) and s = (-1)^(y mod 2).
