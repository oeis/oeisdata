%N A392389 Number of free polybends with n cells.
%C A392389 The cells of a polybend are quarter annuli with a fixed outer radius R and inner radius 2-R, where 1 < R < sqrt(2), with the two straight parts of their boundaries parallel to the coordinate axes. Cells are connected along their straight edges. Overlapping cells are not permitted.
%C A392389 Alternatively, the cells can be taken to be isosceles right triangles (like polyaboloes) which can be glued along their short sides. Cells are allowed to meet along their long sides, but the polybends must be connected through short side connections only.
%C A392389 Cells can be represented as integer points in the plane, with the neighbors of (x,y) being (x,y-s), (x-r,y), (x+r,y-s), (x-r,y+s), where r = (-1)^(x mod 2) and s = (-1)^(y mod 2). If (x,y) is a cell, the cells (x+r,y) and (x,y+s) are not permitted in the same polybend.
