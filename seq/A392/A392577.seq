%N A392577 a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) = a(n-1) - A056240(n) if nonnegative and not already in the sequence, otherwise a(n) = a(n-1) + A056240(n), where A056240(n) is the smallest number whose prime divisors, counted with multiplicity, sum to n.
%C A392577 A variation of Recaman's sequence A005132 where the step size is A056240(n) instead of n.
%C A392577 After one million terms the values that have not appeared are 4, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, ... . It is unknown if all values will appear, although a(619755) = 13, indicating smaller values may eventually be reached after many terms.
%C A392577 The first number to appear twice is 294, at n = 43 and n = 55.

%e A392577 a(6) = 15 as a(5) = 7 while A056240(6) = 8. As 8 > 7 the next term is 7 + 8 = 15. This is the first term to differ from A005132.
%Y A392577 Cf. A056240, A005132.
