%N A392001 Numbers k such that k + 1 is not a power of an odd prime and 2*k + 1 is not a prime power.
%F A392001 k is term <=> A093880(k) = A093880(k+1), i.e., k is term if and only if LCM(2*k) * LCM(k + 1) = (LCM(2*k + 2) * LCM(k), where LCM(k) = lcm(1, 2, ..., k).
%F A392001 If p is prime and p != 13 => (p is term <=> 2*p + 1 is not prime), i.e., if p is prime then p is a non-Sophie-Germain prime (A053176), and apart from 13 all non-Sophie-Germain primes are terms.
%F A392001 Apparently A045979 \ {1, 13} is a subsequence.
%e A392001 7 is a term because 8 is even and 15 is not a prime power.
%e A392001 13 is not a term because 27 is a prime power.
%e A392001 32 is a term because both 33 and 65 are not a prime power.
