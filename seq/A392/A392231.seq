%N A392231 Positive integers (not multiples of 10) whose constant congruence speed is smaller than the product of the constant congruence speeds of all their prime factors (see A373387 for the definition of "constant congruence speed").
%C A392231 For the definition of "constant congruence speed", see Def. 1.2 (and also Def. 1.1) of "Number of stable digits of any integer tetration" in Links (for all positive integers m > 1 and not a multiple of 10, this corresponds to A373387(m)).
%C A392231 Here, prime factors are considered with their multiplicity (e.g., the prime factors of 75 are 3, 5, and 5 and thus the product of their constant congruence speeds equals 1*2*2 = 4).
%C A392231 Furthermore, if the product of two positive integers m' and m'' is not divisible by 10, then the constant congruence speed of m'*m'' is necessarily greater than or equal to the minimum of the constant congruence speeds of m' and m'' (see Equation 2.4 of "A Compact Notation for Peculiar Properties Characterizing Integer Tetration" in Links).
%C A392231 By definition, this sequence contains no prime number.
%C A392231 This sequence belongs to a family of 11 related sequences comparing the constant congruence speed A373387(m) with various combinations of the speeds of its prime factors. See Crossrefs.

%e A392231 a(1) = 14 since the constant congruence speed of 2 is 1, the constant congruence speed of 7 is 2, the constant congruence speed of 2*7 is 1, and 1 is smaller than 1*2.
