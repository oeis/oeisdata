%N A392129 Integers k such that there are i groups of order k+i up to isomorphism, for 1 <= i <= 6.
%C A392129 Each term is 72 modulo 144.
%C A392129 Let g(k) (= A000001(n)) denote the number of groups with k elements.
%C A392129 The factorization of even k where g(k) = c for small c is very constrained.
%C A392129 If we write k = 144m + 72, then k+1 = 144m + 73, k+2 = 2(72m + 37), k+4 = 4(36m + 19), and k+6 = 6(24m + 13).
%C A392129 The only way g(k+2) can be 2 is if 72m + 37 is prime (Olsson 2006).
%C A392129 The only way g(k+4) can be 4 is if 36m + 19 is prime (Miller 1932).
%C A392129 The only way g(k+6) can be 6 is if 24m + 13 is prime (Mahmoud 2024).
%C A392129 For g(k+1) to be 1, 144m + 73 must be squarefree (necessary and easy to sieve, but not sufficient).
%C A392129 For any prime p > 3, in general p cannot divide 72m + 37, 72m + 38, or 72m + 39, unless it equals 72m + 37, 36m + 19, or 24m + 13 respectively.
%C A392129 Thus there are three "bad" residues modulo any prime.
%C A392129 Each bad residue is allowed for at most one m, for example if 36m + 19 = p for some m, then that m is allowed, but no other m where p divides 36m + 19 is allowed.
%C A392129 I believe that the number of "candidate" k that meet all these restrictions up to M is O(M/log(M)^3), due to considering the product of (1 - (3p + 1)/p^2) over all p > 3: modulo p, there are 3 bad residues, and modulo p^2, there is one more.
%C A392129 We can find candidates efficiently by sieving, and then we must check the g(k+3) = 3, g(k+5) = 5, and g(k+1) = 1 conditions by factoring.
%C A392129 It is possible to use sieves to fully check the k+1 and k+3 conditions, but doing this is expensive (94 bits per entry instead of 1, plus more computation steps) and much less effective.
%C A392129 The number of k up to M where g(k+3) = 3 is about (1/300)M, whereas the density of "candidate" k drops as k gets larger and larger.
%C A392129 This sequence is infinite assuming the Bateman-Horn conjecture is true.  We can construct a subsequence where the odd k+i also have a nice factorization by restricting k+3 mod 5^2, then k+5 mod 7^4, then k+7 mod 11^4*43^2 (or many other examples). Eg if k = 8643600m + 1995912, with all of 8643600m + 1995913, 4321800m + 997957, 576240m + 133061, 2160900m + 498979, 25200m + 5819, and 1440600m + 332653 prime, then that's a subsequence of this sequence which is infinite assuming Bateman-Horn (these large linear forms show up when we factor out the gcd from k+1, k+2, etc, and the gcds are constructed so that they have the requisite group number, and then we multiply them by a prime that does not interact).

%e A392129 For k = 2943610, the factorizations of k+1 thru k+6 are as follows:
%e A392129 29436121 = 11 * 13 * 205847 (squarefree with no relations p | q - 1, so we have one group per Olsson 2006, namely the cyclic group)
%e A392129 29436122 = 2 * 14718061 (squarefree with one relation because 2 | 14718061 - 1, so we have two groups per Olsson 2006, namely the cyclic group C2p and the dihedral group D2p)
%e A392129 29436123 = 3 * 43 * 173 * 1319 (squarefree with 3 | 43 - 1 and 43 | 173 - 1 and no other relations, so we have three groups per Olsson 2006)
%e A392129 29436124 = 2^2 * 7359031 (squarefree besides 2^2, with one relation because 2 | 7359031 - 1, so we have four groups per Miller 1932, namely C2 x C2 x Cp, C4 x Cp, C2 x D2p, and D4p)
%e A392129 29436125 = 5^3 * 235489 (squarefree besides 5^3, no relations, so we have five groups per Miller 1932, namely C5 x C5 x C5 x Cp, C5 x C25 x Cp, C125 x Cp, (C5 semidirect product C25) x Cp, and Heisenburg(Z_5) x Cp. The five possibilities for the size 125 subgroup are listed in Conrad, and because p=235489 is coprime to the size of the automorphism group for each of these, there are no nontrivial semidirect products, just the direct product)
%e A392129 29436126 = 2 * 3 * 4906021 (squarefree with 2 | 3 - 1, 2 | 4906021 - 1, and 3 | 4906021 - 1, so we have six groups per Mahmoud 2024)
