%N A392848 Number of 4-regular planar graphs with n vertices whose diagonal graphs are exactly 2-vertex connected and 3-edge connected.
%C A392848 This sequence counts graphs H where vertex connectivity k(H) = 2 and edge connectivity l(H) >= 3. These graphs correspond to the diagonal graphs (also known as face graphs) of the duals of 4-regular 3-connected planar graphs.
%C A392848 For a 4-regular 3-connected planar graph with n vertices, the two diagonal graphs in its dual decomposition each have exactly n edges. This allows for a direct structural partition of the total number of 4-regular 3-connected planar graphs (A007022).
%C A392848 Specifically, this sequence represents the subset of 4-regular polyhedra whose dual decomposition results in 2-vertex-connected components, whereas A002880 represents those that decompose into 3-connected components.
%F A392848 a(n) = A007022(n) - A002880(n).
%Y A392848 Cf. A002880, A007022.
