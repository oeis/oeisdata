%N A392308 Composite numbers c satisfying the congruence c * sigma_k(c) == 2 (mod phi(c)) that are "flanked" by 14 at k-1 and k+1.
%C A392308 Here, "flanking by 14" means that when (composite) c satisfies the congruence c * sigma_k(c) == 2 (mod phi(c)) at k, 14 satisfies the same congruence for both k-1 and k+1 (see Example).
%C A392308 If c != 4, 6 is flanked by 14 at some k, then it is flanked by 14 at any k for which it satisfies the congruence.
%C A392308 Union of rows k in A392306 such that rows k-1 and k+1 include 14.
%C A392308 The Kominers article below shows that 14 is the only integer that can flank in this way and also gives a precise characterization of the flanked c.

%e A392308 22 is a term because it satisfies the congruence for k = 1,5,9,13,..., and in each instance, 14 "flanks" it.
%e A392308 Likewise, the A392306 Example illustrates that 14 flanks 262 (k=5), 166 (k=9), and 118, 454, and 65542 (k=13).
%e A392308 4 and 6 are the only irregular terms, in the sense that they satisfy the congruence for every k, and thus are flanked by 14 in some instances (e.g., k=1, 3) but not in others (e.g., k=2, 4).
