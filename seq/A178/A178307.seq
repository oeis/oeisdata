%N A178307 Remove powers of 2 from A000069. Let b(n) be n-th term of the remaining sequence. Then a(n) is the least number m such that (b(n))^m is in A001969.
%C A178307 The sequence {b(n)} coincides with A075930. Conjecture. For every n>=1, a(n) does exist.
%C A178307 The sequence b(n) is A075930 (Positions of check bits in code in A075928); see comment in that sequence. [From _Jeremy Gardiner_, May 26 2010]
%F A178307 If k=b(n)=2^m*b(s), where b(s) is odd, then a(n)=a(s).
