%N A178526 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of nodes of cost k in the Fibonacci tree of order n.
%C A178526 A Fibonacci tree of order n (n>=2) is a complete binary tree whose left subtree is the Fibonacci tree of order n-1 and whose right subtree is the Fibonacci tree of order n-2; each of the Fibonacci trees of order 0 and 1 is defined as a single node. In a Fibonacci tree the cost of a left (right) edge is defined to be 1 (2). The cost of a node of a Fibonacci tree is defined to be the sum of the costs of the edges that form the path from the root to this node.
%C A178526 The sum of the entries in row n is A001595(n) = 2F(n+1) - 1, where F(m)=A000045(m) (the Fibonacci numbers).
%C A178526 Sum(k*T(n,k), 0<=k<=n)=A178525(n).

%C A178526 The falling diagonals are, starting from the rightmost one, with index 0:
%C A178526   d_0(i) = F(i-1), i >= 0;
%C A178526   d_j(i) = F(i+1), j >= 1, i >= 0.
%C A178526 Equivalently, as a single expression:
%C A178526   d_j(i) = F(i+1-2*0^j), j >= 0, i >= 0. (End)

%F A178526 T(n,k)=F(k+1) if k<n; T(n,n)=F(n-1); T(n,k)=0 if k>n; here F(m)=A000045(m) (the Fibonacci numbers).

%F A178526 The enumerating polynomials P[n] of row n are given by P[0]=1, P[n]=P[n-1]+F(n-1)*(t^{n-1}+t^n) for n>=1, where F(m)=A000045(m) (the Fibonacci numbers).
%e A178526 In the Fibonacci tree /\ of order 2 we have a node of cost 0 (the root), a node of cost 1 (the left leaf), and a node of cost 2 (the right leaf).
