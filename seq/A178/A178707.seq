%N A178707 Position of the start of the first occurrence of n (expressed in binary) after the binary point in the binary expansion of Pi.
%C A178707 Here the first 2 bits of Pi are ignored, in A332929 they are included in the binary digits to search. - _M. F. Hasler_, Feb 06 2026
%e A178707 The first nonnegative integer is 0; its binary expansion is 0, which is found at the first digit after Pi's binary point; therefore the first term in the sequence is "1".
%e A178707 The sixth nonnegative integer is 5; its binary expansion is 101, which is found starting at the 16th digit after Pi's binary point; therefore the sixth term in the sequence is "16".
