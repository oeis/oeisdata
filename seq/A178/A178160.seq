%N A178160 Digits (after the leading "0.") of "Type-2 Trott-like Constants" (see Comments lines for definition).
%C A178160 Consider a finite sequence S consisting of k single-digit positive numbers d_1, d_2, ..., d_k (k>0).
%C A178160 Let rMin and rMax, respectively, be the minimum and maximum values that can be expressed as a decimal number having 0 to the left of the decimal point and an infinite number of nonzero digits to the right, beginning with the k digits of S.
%C A178160 Let fMin and fMax, respectively, be the minimum and maximum values that can be expressed as a continued fraction of the form f=0+d_1/(d_2+d_3/(d_4+d_5/(d_6+...))) using an infinite number of terms, beginning with the k digits of S.
%C A178160 Define the decimal number having 0 to the left of the decimal point and only the k digits of S to the right as a "type-2 Trott-like constant" if and only if the intervals [rMin,rMax] and [fMin,fMax] intersect.
%C A178160 Under this definition, type-2 Trott-like constants are plentiful, but their density approaches zero as the number of digits increases (see A178161).
%C A178160 With extremely few exceptions (see A178162), any type-2 Trott-like constant can be extended to an arbitrary number of digits, yielding an arbitrarily large number of digits of agreement between the digits of the decimal expansion and the terms of the continued fraction (for example, see A178163 and A178164, and their associated b-files, for the first few thousand digits of the smallest and largest arbitrarily long type-2 Trott-like constants).
%C A178160 The constant of A091694 (discovered by Michael Trott, and referred to as "Trott's second constant" or the "second Trott constant") is special in that the terms given for it yield an especially large number of digits of agreement.

%e A178160 27 is in the sequence because the minimum and maximum values that can be expressed as 0.27ddd (where the "ddd" represents an infinite number of nonnegative digits, not necessarily the same) are 0.27111... and 0.27999...,
%e A178160 and the minimum and maximum values that can be expressed as 0+2/(7+d_1/(d_2+d_3/(...))) (where each d_i represents a single-digit positive term, of which there are an infinite number in the continued fraction) are
%e A178160 0+2/(7+9/(1+1/(9+9/(1+1/(9+9/...))))) = 0.12891... and
%e A178160 0+2/(7+1/(9+9/(1+1/(9+9/(1+1/...))))) = 0.28340...,
%e A178160 and the intervals [0.27111...,0.27999...] and [0.12891...,0.28340...] intersect, so 0.27 is a type-2 Trott-like constant.
%e A178160 28 is not in the sequence because the corresponding intervals do not intersect.
