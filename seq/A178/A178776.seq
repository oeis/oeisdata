%N A178776 a(n) is the largest number that appears twice in an n X n multiplication table of positive integers, disregarding the pairs that are obviously produced by the commutative property.
%C A178776 It appears that all terms of this sequence are multiple of 4 (checked up to 10^7). - _Michel Marcus_, Aug 26 2013
%C A178776 Marcus's comment is true. Indeed, the proof follows by induction and by noticing that both x*(x-1) and y*(y-1) are even. - _Sela Fried_, Nov 15 2025
%F A178776 Let x*y = n be the factorization of n such that x+y is a minimum. We then have a(4) = 4 and a(n) = max{a(n-1), x*y*(x-1)*(y-1)} for all n>4.
%e A178776 The first term is 4, which appears twice in a 4 X 4 multiplication table. a(4) = 2*2 = 4*1 = 4. For all n = prime a(n) = a(n-1) so a(5) = 4. a(6) = 12 = 2*6 = 3*4, a(7) = 12, a(8) = 24 = 3*8 = 4*6, a(9) = 36 = 4*9 = 6*6.
