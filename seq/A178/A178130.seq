%N A178130 Numbers whose fifth power is the sum of a positive square and cube: n^5 = x^2 + y^3 with x, y > 0.
%C A178130 If a number appears more than once, it can be expressed in as many ways as its occurrence.
%C A178130 Zeros are not allowed otherwise 8 would appear twice, since 8^5 = 0^2 + 32^3 = 104^2 + 28^3. - _Michel Marcus_, Feb 25 2013
%C A178130 Cubes are not allowed to be negative, otherwise there would be two 8 and two 32, since 8^5 = 192^2 - 16^3 and 32^5=36352^2 - 1088^3. - _Giovanni Resta_, Feb 25 2013
%C A178130 Sequence is infinite: if k is a term then k*m^6, for any m, is also a term. For example, {8, 19, 24, 28, 32, 36}*2^6 = {512, 1216, 1536, 1792, 2048, 2304}, or terms 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 multiplied by 2^6 = terms 23, 34, 39, 42, 48, and 50. - _Zak Seidov_, Jun 27 2013
%e A178130 For n=4 a(4)=28 since 28^5 = 3912^2 + 124^3.
%e A178130 Multiple representation can happen like 3528^5 = 714208320^2 + 331632^3 = 464679936^2 + 691488^3.
%e A178130 432 is the smallest having multiple representation, since 432^5 = 3732480^2 + 10368^3 = 3359232^2 + 15552^3.

%E A178130 It seems that 1392 is wrong and should be omitted. - _Zak Seidov_, Jun 25 2010
%E A178130 Script also found that 1392 is wrong, so 1392 has been removed and 2304 has been appended instead. - _Michel Marcus_, Feb 27 2013
