%N A178981 2^A003418(n); for n >= 1, the least number > 1 that can be expressed simultaneously as a k-th power of some integer for all 1 <= k <= n.
%C A178981 Equivalently, for n >= 1, the least number > 1 of objects that can be arranged as a k-cube (k-dimensional hypercube) for all 1 <= k <= n.
%C A178981 a(7) = 2^420 contains 127 decimal digits.
%C A178981 From _Jianing Song_, Jul 20 2021: (Start)
%C A178981 Let F_q be the finite field with q elements, then F_a(n) is the smallest extension field of F_2 such that every polynomial of degree at most n splits into linear factors.
%C A178981 Union_{n>=0} F_a(n) is the algebraic clousre of F_2, which is the unique algebraically closed field with characteristic 2 and transcendence degree 0 (note that an algebraically closed field is uniquely determined by its characteristic and transcendence degree). Union_{n>=0} F_(2^(n!)) = Union_{n>=0} F_A050923(n) gives the same field.
%C A178981 Obviously, here 2 can be replaced by any prime p provided that {a(n)} is defined as a(n) = p^A003418(n). (End)
