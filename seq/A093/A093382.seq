%N A093382 a(n) = length k of longest binary sequence x(1) ... x(k) such that for no n <= i < j <= k/2 is x(i) ... x(2i) a subsequence of x(j) ... x(2j).
%C A093382 Doesn't the binary sequence 000010011001110011101010101010101010101100110 demonstrate that a(2)>=45 ? - _R. J. Mathar_, Jul 29 2007 Answer: No - see the following comment.
%C A093382 The sequence of length 45 above does not satisfy the requirements of the definition: Subsequences are not required to be consecutive. Therefore it cannot show a(2)>=45. In the sequence we find for i=2, j=3: x(i..2i) is 000; x(j..2j) is 001001; and 000 is a subsequence of 001001. - _Don Reble_, May 13 2008
%D A093382 a(1) - a(3) computed by R. Dougherty, who finds that a(4) >= 187205.
