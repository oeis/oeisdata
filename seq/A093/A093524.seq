%N A093524 Decimal expansion of 3977/216000 - Pi^2/2160.
%C A093524 Average volume of a tetrahedron picked at random in a unit cube.
%C A093524 From _Amiram Eldar_, Aug 25 2020: (Start)
%C A093524 The exact value of this constant was first calculated by Zinani (2003).
%C A093524 Equals (1/5) times the probability that 5 points independently and uniformly chosen in a cube are the vertices of a re-entrant (concave) polyhedron, i.e., one of the points falls within the tetrahedron formed by the other 4 points. Do and Solomon (1986) evaluated this probability using simulations, and their result is equivalent to an estimate of 0.0139 of this constant, with a 95% confidence interval of [0.01358, 0.01420] (Zinani, 2003).
