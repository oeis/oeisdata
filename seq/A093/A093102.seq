%N A093102 An "L" digit is a digit "looking to the Left" (1,2,3,7,9); an "R" digit is a digit "looking to the Right" (4,5,6); an "U" digit is a digit "looking at Us" (0,8). This is the slowest increasing sequence showing the infinite pattern [LR] (when read digit-by-digit).
%C A093102 The equivalent sequence showing the [RL] pattern is the same as this one, but without the first element (1) -- thus starting with (4).
