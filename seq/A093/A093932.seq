%N A093932 For n > 0, a(n+1) is the least prime not already used such that abs(a(n+1)-a(n)/2n is prime.
%C A093932 The last term is a(110) = 5. The smallest primes that don't occur are 2, 11, 23 and 113. - _David Wasserman_, Mar 07 2007
%e A093932 a(5) = 47 hence a(6) = 17, which has not occurred earlier, as (47-17)/(2*5) = 3 is a prime.
