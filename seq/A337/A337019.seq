%N A337019 Maximum number of circles with unit area that can be packed into an equilateral triangle with an area of n.
%C A337019 Are a(17) = 12 and a(18) = 13 proved? They look likely to be no more difficult to prove than some of the earlier terms, and are demonstrably lower bounds by the figures in the Friedman link. - _Peter Munn_, Apr 25 2023
%C A337019 The packing density, a(n)/n, approaches sqrt(3)*Pi/6 (approximately 0.9069) as n tends to infinity.
