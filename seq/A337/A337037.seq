%N A337037 Numbers whose every unordered factorization has a distinct sum of factors.
%C A337037 The number 1 is in the sequence by convention.
%C A337037 All primes p are trivially in the sequence.
%C A337037 All semiprimes greater than 4 are in the sequence because they have only two unordered factorizations pq = p*q whose sums are distinct. They are distinct because the only solution to p*q = p+q is p=q=2.
%C A337037 If a number m is not in the sequence, then all multiples of m are not in the sequence. For example, multiples of 4 are not in the sequence because there always exist at least two factorizations 4*k = 2*2*k whose factors sum to the same value 4+k = 2+2+k.
%C A337037 The complement is in A337080.
%C A337037 Numbers m such that A069016(m) = A001055(m). - _Michel Marcus_, Aug 15 2020

%e A337037 All unordered factorization of 30 are 30 = 2*15 = 3*10 = 5*6 = 2*3*5. Corresponding sums of factors are distinct: 30, 17 = 15+2, 13 = 10+3, 11 = 6+5, 10 = 2+3+5. Therefore 30 is in the sequence.
%e A337037 All unordered factorization of 90 are 90 = 45*2 = 30*3 = 18*5 = 15*6 = 15*3*2 = 10*9 = 9*5*2 = 10*3*3 = 6*5*3 = 5*3*3*2. Corresponding sums of factors are not all distinct: 90, 57, 33, 23, 21, 20, 19, 16, 16, 14, 13 because the sum 16 = 10+3+3 = 9+5+2 appears twice. Therefore 90 is not in the sequence.
