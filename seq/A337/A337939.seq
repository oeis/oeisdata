%N A337939 Irregular triangle T(n, m) read by rows: row n gives the distinct length ratios diagonal/side of regular n-gons, DSR(n, k), for n >= 2, k = 1, 2, ..., floor(n/2), expressed by the coefficients in the power basis of the Galois group Gal(Q(rho(n))/Q), where rho(n) = 2*cos(Pi/n), for n >= 2. T(1, 1) is set to 1.
%C A337939 The length of row n is given in A338431(n), for n >= 1.
%C A337939 The length of the sublists t(n, k) of the power basis coefficients of DSR(n, k), for k = 1, 2, ..., floor(n/2), is 1 if n = 1, for n >= 2 it is k except for n = n(j) = A111774(j) for which the final A219839(n) sublists have fewer than k members.
%C A337939 Trailing vanishing coefficients of the delta(n) = A055034(n) power base elements <1 = rho(n)^0, rho(n)^1, ..., rho(n)^{delta(n)-1}> are not recorded. The coefficients of the minimal polynomial C(n, x) of rho(n) = 2*cos(Pi/n) of degree delta(n) are given in A187360. C(n, rho(n)) = 0 is used to eliminate all powers of rho with exponent >= delta(n).
%C A337939 The length ratios DSR(n, k) := diagonal(n, k)/side(n) of regular n-gons, for n >= 2, and k = 1, 2, ..., floor(n/2) (distinct diagonals, starting with the side for k = 1, in increasing order) are given by DSR(n, k) = S(k-1, rho(n)), with the Chebyshev S polynomials (A049310). See the W. Lang link.
%C A337939 For n = 2, the degenerate case, diagonal/side = side/side = 1 for k = 1. For n = 1 (a point) diagonal/side is undetermined, and T(1, 1) is set to 1.
%C A337939 For the power basis sublists t(n, k), for k = 1, 2, ..., delta(n), only the k coefficients of S(k-1, x) are present (trailing vanishing coefficients are not recorded). For k = delta(n)+1, ..., floor(n/2) less than k coefficients appear due to elimination via C(n, rho(n)) = 0. E.g., for n = 6 with delta(6) = 2 the only coefficient for k = 3 is 2 (coefficient of rho^0). This appears for n = n(j) = A111774(j), because then floor(n/2) - delta(n) = A219839(n) > 0.
%C A337939 Because A219839(n) = 0 means that n is from A174090, i.e., a prime or a power of 2 (complement of A111774), these rows n have all the sublists t(n, k) with the k coefficients of S(k-1, x), hence they are identical (but the basis differs). See especially the table for the pairs of consecutive numbers n with identical coefficients, like (2, 3), (4, 5), (16, 17), (256, 267), (65536, 65537), ?... (cf. Fermat primes A019434).

%F A337939 T(1, 1) = 1, and in row n, for n >= 2, the power base coefficients of Gal(Q(2*cos(Pi/n))/Q) for DSR(n, k) := diagonal(n, k)/side(n) of regular n-gons, for k = 1, 2, ..., floor(n/2), are listed as t(n, k) in this order, with trailing vanishing coefficients omitted.
