%N A337052 Numbers k such that the powerful part of k has an even number of prime divisors counted with multiplicity.
%C A337052 Numbers k such that A001222(A057521(k)) == 0 (mod 2).
%C A337052 Numbers k such that A057521(k) is in A028260.
%C A337052 Differs from A096432 by having the additional terms 1 and 216, 256, 768, 864, ... and not having the terms 432, 648, ...
%C A337052 First differs from both A220218 and A335275 at n = 193: a(193) = 216 is not a term of these two sequences.
%C A337052 Cohen (1964) proved that this sequence has an asymptotic density, and gave the value 1/2 + (1/5) * Product_{p prime} (1 + (p^2 + p + 1)/(p^3 * (p + 1))) = 0.8172707179... But the numbers of terms not exceeding 10^k for k = 1, 2, ... are 9, 90, 885, 8849, 88499, 884993, 8849889, 88498711, 884987643, 8849876178, ... indicating that the asymptotic density is about 0.88498...
