%N A337533 1 together with nonsquares whose square part's square root is in the sequence.
%C A337533 The appearance of a number is determined by its prime signature.
%C A337533 Every squarefree number is present, as the square root of the square part of a squarefree number is 1. Other 4th-power-free numbers are present if and only if they are nonsquare.
%C A337533 If the square part of nonsquarefree k is a 4th power, k does not appear.
%C A337533 Every positive integer k is the product of a unique subset S_k of the terms of A050376, which are arranged in array form in A329050 (primes in column 0, squares of primes in column 1, 4th powers of primes in column 2 and so on). k > 1 is in this sequence if and only if the members of S_k occur in consecutive columns of A329050, starting with column 0.
%C A337533 If the qualifying condition in the previous paragraph was based on the rows instead of the columns of A329050, we would get A055932. The self-inverse function defined by A225546 transposes A329050. A225546 also has multiplicative properties such that if we consider A055932 and this sequence as sets, A225546(.) maps the members of either set 1:1 onto the other set.

%e A337533 4 is square and not 1, so 4 is not in the sequence.
%e A337533 12 = 3 * 2^2 is nonsquare, and has square part 4, whose square root (2) is in the sequence. So 12 is in the sequence.
%e A337533 32 = 2 * 4^2 is nonsquare, but has square part 16, whose square root (4) is not in the sequence. So 32 is not in the sequence.
