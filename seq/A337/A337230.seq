%N A337230 Numbers that are a divisor of the product of the digits of its divisors.
%C A337230 In the first 130 million numbers there are 117 terms, the last being 234375. It is possible no more terms exist, although this is unknown.
%C A337230 The number with the largest ratio of it divisors' digit product to the number itself is 5376, with a ratio of ~2.2*10^43.
%C A337230 From _David A. Corneth_, Aug 22 2020: (Start)
%C A337230 The product of the digits of divisors must be nonzero. For example, 10 isn't a term as the product of digits of divisors is 0.
%C A337230 Terms are 7-smooth.
%C A337230 The largest term is 234375. Proof:
%C A337230 2^k1 has a 0 for k1 = 10, 3^k2 has a 0 for k2 = 10, 5^k3 has a 0 for k3 = 8 and 7^k4 has a 0 for k4 = 4.
%C A337230 Checking all numbers of the form 2^e1 * 3^e2 * 5^e3 * 7^e4 with ei bounded by the respective ki gives the 117 terms mentioned above with the largest of them being 234375. (End)

%e A337230 a(4) = 4 is a term as the divisors of 4 are 1,2,4 and 1*2*4 = 8 which is a divisible by 4.
%e A337230 a(10) = 12 is a term as the divisors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12 and 1*2*3*4*6*1*2 = 288 which is divisible by 12.
%e A337230 a(19) = 28 is a term as the divisors of 28 are 1,2,4,7,14,28 and 1*2*4*7*1*4*2*8 = 3584 which is divisible by 28.
