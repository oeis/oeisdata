%N A337418 Number of sets (in the Hausdorff metric geometry) at each location between two sets defined by a complete bipartite graph K(3,n) (with n at least 3) missing two edges, where the removed edges are not incident to the same vertex in the 3 point part but are incident to the same vertex in the other part.
%C A337418 The Hausdorff metric defines a distance between sets. Using this distance we can define line segments with sets as endpoints. Create two sets from the vertices of the parts A and B (with |A| = 3) of a complete bipartite graph K(3,n) (with n at least 3) missing two edges, where the removed edges are not incident to the same vertex in A but are incident to the same vertex in B. Points in the sets A and B that correspond to vertices that are connected by edges are the same Euclidean distance apart. This sequence tells the number of sets at each location on the line segment between A and B.
%C A337418 Number of {0,1} 3 X n (with n at least 3) matrices with two fixed zero entries in the same column and no zero rows or columns.
%C A337418 Take a complete bipartite graph K(3,n) (with n at least 3) having parts A and B where |A| = 3. This sequence gives the number of edge covers of the graph obtained from this K(3,n) graph after removing two edges, where the removed edges are not incident to the same vertex in A but are incident to the same vertex in B.
