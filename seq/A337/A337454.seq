%N A337454 a(n) is the number of divisors of n such that the ratio (the number of nonnegative m < n such that m^d == m (mod n))/(the number of nonnegative m < n such that -m^d == m (mod n)) is also a divisor of n.
%C A337454 a(n) is the number of ordered pairs (x,y) of divisors of n such that the ratio (the number of nonnegative m < n such that m^x == m (mod n)) / (the number of nonnegative m < n such that -m^x == m (mod n)) is equal to y. These pairs of divisors of each n define the direction of the arcs of some directed graph, the vertices of the number a(n) of which are indicated by the corresponding values of the divisors.
%C A337454 1 <= a(n) <= tau(n) where tau(n) is the number of divisors of n.
%C A337454 The boundary sequences of this relation are A338189 (numbers i such that a(i) = 1) and A338190 (numbers j such that a(j) = tau(j)).
%C A337454 Furthermore, for any nonnegative k, 1 <= the ratio (the number of nonnegative m < n such that m^k == m (mod n)) / (the number of nonnegative m < n such that -m^k == m (mod n)) <= n.
%C A337454 The number of divisors d such that A334006(n,d) is also a divisor of n. - _Peter Kagey_, Sep 09 2020
