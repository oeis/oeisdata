%N A337441 Number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a 2D square lattice where the walk consists of three different units and each unit cannot be adjacent to another unit of the same type.
%C A337441 Consider a self-avoiding walk composed of three different types of repeating units which cannot be adjacent to a unit of the same type. This sequence gives the total number of such n-step walks on the square lattice. Note that the walk will only differ from the standard self-avoiding walk of A001411 if the number of different repeating units is an odd number; in a chain composed of an even number the same unit types will never be adjacent and thus their mutual repulsion will have no effect.
%H A337441 A. J. Guttmann, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0305-4470/20/7/029">On the critical behavior of self-avoiding walks</a>, J. Phys. A 20 (1987), 1839-1854.
%e A337441 The walk consists of three different units:
%e A337441 .
%e A337441 ... --A--B--C--A--B--C--A--B--C-- ...
%e A337441 .
%e A337441 The one forbidden 4-step walk in the first quadrant is:
%e A337441 .
%e A337441 A---C
%e A337441     |
%e A337441 A---B
%e A337441 .
%e A337441 as two A units cannot be adjacent. As this walk can be taken in eight different ways on the square lattice a(3) = 4*8 + 4 - 8 = A001411(3) - 8 = 28;
%e A337441 The two forbidden 4-step walks are:
%e A337441 .
%e A337441     C---A       B---A
%e A337441     |   |           |
%e A337441 A---B   B   A---B---C
%e A337441 .
%e A337441 as two B unit cannot be adjacent. These, along with the forbidden 3-step walk, remove four 4-step walks so a(4) = 12*8 + 4 - 8*4 = A001411(4) - 32 = 68.
%e A337441 Three forbidden 5-step walks are:
%e A337441 .
%e A337441 B---A
%e A337441 |   |           A---B           C---B
%e A337441 C   C           |   |               |
%e A337441     |   A---B---C   C   A---B---C---A
%e A337441 A---B
%e A337441 .
%e A337441 as two C units cannot be adjacent.
%e A337441 Up to n=6 this sequence matches A173380 as the later excludes the above same walks as it does not allow any adjacencies. However for n=7 the below two first-quadrant walks are allowed in this sequence:
%e A337441 .
%e A337441 A---C---B   C---B---A
%e A337441 |       |   |       |
%e A337441 B       A   A       C
%e A337441         |   |       |
%e A337441 A---B---C   B   A---B
%e A337441 .
%e A337441 as the A and B units, being different, can be adjacent. These same walks are forbidden in A173380. As each of these can be taken in 8 ways on the square lattice a(7) = A173380(7) + 2*8 = 940 + 16 = 956.
