%N A322548 Integers x such that x^2 + 119 = 15*2^y.
%C A322548 The exponents y of the corresponding powers of 2 are 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 15.
%C A322548 The list gives all positive integers x such that x^2 + 119 = 15*2^y.
%C A322548 Yann Bugeaud proposed the problem to prove that there is an absolute constant C such that, for any positive integers D, k and a prime number p such that gcd(D, kp) = 1, the Diophantine equation x^2 + D = k*p^n has at most C integer solutions (x, n) (Problem 9 of the list of 22 open problems below).
