%N A322309 Largest automorphism group size for a binary self-dual code of length 2n.
%C A322309 A code is usually represented by a generating matrix.  The row space of the generating matrix is the code itself.
%C A322309 Self-dual codes are codes such that all codewords of the code are pairwise orthogonal to each other.
%C A322309 Two codes are called permutation equivalent if one code can be obtained by permuting the coordinates (columns) of the other code.
%C A322309 The automorphism group of a code is the set of permutations of the coordinates (columns) that result in the same identical code.
%C A322309 The values in the sequence are not calculated upper bounds.  For each n there exists a binary self-dual code of length 2n with an automorphism group of size a(n).
%C A322309 Binary self-dual codes have been classified (accounted for) up to a certain length. The classification process requires the automorphism group size be known for each code.  There is a mass formula to calculate the number of distinct binary self-dual codes of a given length.  The automorphism group size allows researchers to calculate the number of codes that are permutationally equivalent to a code.  Each new binary self-dual code C of length m that is discovered will account for m!/aut(C) codes in the total number calculated by the mass formula. Aut(C) represents the automorphism size of the code C.
