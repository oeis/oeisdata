%N A322389 Vertex-connectivity of the integer partition with Heinz number n.
%C A322389 The Heinz number of an integer partition (y_1, ..., y_k) is prime(y_1) * ... * prime(y_k).
%C A322389 The vertex-connectivity of an integer partition is the minimum number of primes that must be divided out (and any parts then equal to 1 removed) so that the prime factorizations of the remaining parts form a disconnected (or empty) hypergraph.

%e A322389 The integer partition (6,4,3) with Heinz number 455 does not become disconnected or empty if 2 is divided out giving (3,3), or if 3 is divided out giving (4,2), but it does become disconnected or empty if both 2 and 3 are divided out giving (); so a(455) = 2.
%e A322389 195 is the Heinz number of (6,3,2), corresponding to the multiset partition {{1},{2},{1,2}}. Removing the vertex 1 gives {{2},{2}}, while removing 2 gives {{1},{1}}. These are both connected, so both vertices must be removed to obtain a disconnected or empty multiset partition; hence a(195) = 2.
