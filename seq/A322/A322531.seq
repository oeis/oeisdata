%N A322531 Heinz numbers of integer partitions whose parts all have the same number of prime factors (counted with or without multiplicity) and whose product of parts is a squarefree number.
%C A322531 The Heinz number of an integer partition (y_1, ..., y_k) is prime(y_1) * ... * prime(y_k).
%C A322531 All entries are themselves squarefree numbers (except the powers of 2).
%C A322531 The first odd term not in this sequence but in A302521 is 141, which is the MM-number (see A302242) of {{1},{2,3}}.
%e A322531 The sequence of all integer partitions whose parts all have the same number of prime factors and whose product of parts is a squarefree number begins: (), (1), (2), (1,1), (3), (1,1,1), (5), (6), (3,2), (1,1,1,1), (7), (10), (11), (1,1,1,1,1), (5,2), (13), (14), (15), (7,2), (5,3), (17), (1,1,1,1,1,1).
