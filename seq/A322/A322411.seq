%N A322411 Compound tribonacci sequence with a(n) = A278040(A278041(n)), for n >= 0.
%C A322411 The nine sequences A308199, A319967, A319968, A322410, A322409,  A322411,  A322413, A322412, A322414 are based on defining the tribonacci ternary word to start with index 0 (in contrast to the usual definition, in A080843 and A092782, which starts with index 1). As a result these nine sequences differ from the compound tribonacci sequences defined in  A278040, A278041, and A319966-A319972. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Apr 05 2019

%F A322411 a(n) = A(C(n)) = A(C(n) + 1) - 2 = 4*A(n) + 3*B(n) + 2*n + 8, for n >= 0, with A = A278040 and C = A278041. For a proof see the W. Lang link in A278040, Proposition 9, eq. (50).
%F A322411 This formula already follows from Theorem 15 in the 1972 paper by Carlitz et al., which gives that b(c(n)) = a(n) + 2b(n) + 2c(n), where a, b and c are the classical positional sequences of the letters in the tribonacci word. The connection is made by using that c(n) = a(n) + b(n) + n, and by making the translation B(n) = a(n+1)-1, A(n) = b(n+1)-1, C(n) = c(n+1)-1. (Note the switching of A and B!). - _Michel Dekking_, Apr 07 2019
%F A322411 a(n+1) = A319969(n)-1 = A003145(A003146(n))-1, the corresponding classical compound tribonacci sequence. - _Michel Dekking_, Apr 04 2019
