%N A366872 Number of closed chains of identical regular polygons with connecting inner vertices lying n vertices apart.
%C A366872 Consider j identical regular polygons, assembled into a circular closed chain. Two neighboring polygons share an edge and two vertices, the "inner" one lying in the interior of the chain. The interior is a j-pointed star with equal edges.
%C A366872 n is introduced in order to partition the set of chains into finite subsets. Two neighboring star points are separated by n vertices; there the star has reflex angles. (With n=0, regular polygons are considered as stars with no reflex angles.)
%C A366872 Geometrical reasoning shows that for each n there are finitely many (not zero) chains with the described properties.
%C A366872 a(n) is the number of these chains and equals d(8+4n), the number of divisors of 8+4n.
%C A366872 For every m > 4 there exists a chain of m-gons. The possible m for each n are given by A383168.
%C A366872 For every j > 2 there exists a chain with exactly j polygons. The possible j for each n are given by A383169.

%F A366872 a(n) = A000005(8+4n).
%F A366872 a(n) > 5, with the exceptions a(0) = 4 and a(2) = 5.
%F A366872 a(n) = 6 iff n = 6 or n + 2 is an odd prime.
%e A366872 a(0) = 4 is the number of chains of identical regular polygons which have an interior regular polygon, namely 10 pentagons, 6 hexagons, 4 octagons, 3 dodecagons.
%e A366872 a(1) = 6 is the number of chains of identical regular polygons which have an interior proper star with identical edges, namely 14 heptagons, 8 octagons, 6 nonagons, 5 decagons, 4 dodecagons, 3 18-gons.
