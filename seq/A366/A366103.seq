%N A366103 a(n) = n if n is 1 or a prime. If n is composite, p is the greatest prime not exceeding n, and k = n - p, then a(n) is the least novel m*a(k), where m is not a prior term.
%C A366103 There are infinitely many primes, and given any nonprime positive integer n there exists a greatest prime p such that p < n. Therefore the sequence is well defined, infinite, and the "least novel m*a(k)" condition ensures that every number will eventually be included. The sequence is therefore a permutation of A000027, in which (by the definition) the primes are in natural order.

%H A366103 Michael De Vlieger, <a href="/A366103/a366103_2.png">Color-coded list of terms</a> 30 to a row, 900 total, showing primes in red and squarefree semiprimes in light green, demonstrating a tendency for the former to directly precede the latter. The primes maintain their arrangement therefore outside of 2, 3, and 5, they tend to fall within reduced residues mod 30.
%F A366103 a(n) = n for n prime.
%e A366103 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2 and a(3) = 3 since 1,2 and 3 are all in A008578 (1 and primes).
%e A366103 For n = 4  write 4 = 3+1 then a(4) is the least novel multiple m*a(1) = m, where m is not a term; thus a(4) = 4.
%e A366103 a(5) = 5 since 5 is prime
%e A366103 For n = 6 write 6 = 5+1 then a(6) = least novel multiple m*a(1)  = m, where m is not a term, so a(6) = 6.
%e A366103 a(7) = 7 since 7 is prime.
%e A366103 For n = 8 write 8 = 7+1 then a(8) = 8
%e A366103 For n = 9 write 9 = 7+2 then a(9) = least novel m*a(2) = 2*m, where m is not yet a term, thus a(9) = 2*9 = 18.
%e A366103 Sequence can be listed as an irregular table with each row starting with a term in A008578 (1 or prime), in which row lengths equate to the corresponding gaps between consecutive primes; A001223.
