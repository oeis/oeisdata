%N A366863 Minimal values of a corresponding to the numbers c listed in A366862, i.e., such that there exist integers a > b > c such that ab+c, ac+b and bc+a are perfect squares.
%e A366863 a(1) = 9 since (a, b, c) = (9, 7, 1) is the smallest solution with c = A366862(1) = 1: 9*7 + 1 = 64, 9*1 + 7 = 16 = 7*1 + 9 are squares.
%e A366863 a(2) = 28 is in the sequence since (a, b, c) = (28, 9, 4) is the smallest solution with c = A366862(2) = 4.
%e A366863 a(3) = 52 is in the sequence since (a, b, c) = (52, 16, 9) is the smallest solution with c = A366862(3) = 9.
%e A366863 a(4) = 16 is in the sequence since (a, b, c) = (57, 49, 16) is the smallest solution with c = A366862(4) = 16.
%e A366863 a(5) = 12 is in the sequence since (a, b, c) = (73, 24, 12) is the smallest solution with c = A366862(5) = 12.
