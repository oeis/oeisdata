%N A366502 Let q = A246655(n) for n >= 2, then a(n) = (q - Kronecker(-4,q))/4 - 1.
%C A366502 If q is not a power of 2, then a(n) is the number of pairs of consecutive nonzero squares in the finite field F_q. In other words, a(n) is the number of solutions to x^((q-1)/2) = (x+1)^((q-1)/2) = 1 in F_q. This can be proved by generalizing the argument of Jack D'Aurizio to the Math Stack Exchange question "Existence of Consecutive Quadratic residues" to the case of F_q.

%e A366502 a(5) = 1 because there is one pair of consecutive nonzero squares in the finite field F_q with q = A246655(5) = 7, namely {1, 2}.
%e A366502 a(7) = 1 because there is one pair of consecutive nonzero squares in the finite field F_q with q = A246655(7) = 9, namely {1, 2} (note that 2 = -1 = i^2 in F_9 = F_3(i)).
