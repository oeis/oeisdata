%N A366044 Number of circular binary sequences of length n with an even number of 0's and no three consecutive 1's.
%C A366044 A circular binary sequence is a finite sequence of 0's and 1's for which the first and last digits are considered to be adjacent. Rotations are distinguished from each other. Also called a marked cyclic binary sequence.
%C A366044 a(n) is also equal to the number of circular compositions of n into an even number of 1s, 2s, and 3s.

%F A366044 a(n) = (1/2)*A001644(n) - 1/2 + 2*[n==0 (mod 4)].
%F A366044 a(n) = a(n-2)+2*a(n-3)+3*a(n-4)+2*a(n-5)+a(n-6), a(1)=0, a(2)=1, a(3)=3, a(4)=7, a(5)=10, a(6)=19.
%F A366044 a(n) = A001644(n) - A366045(n).
%e A366044 The sequence '1' is not allowed because the 1 is considered to be adjacent to itself. Similarly '11' is not allowed. Thus a(1)=0 because the sequence '0' does not have an even number of 0's, and a(2)=1 because '00' is the only allowed sequence of length two.
%e A366044 For n=4, the a(4)=7 allowed sequences are 0000, 0011, 0101, 0110, 1001, 1010, 1100.
