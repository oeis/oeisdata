%N A255830 Numbers D such that D^2 = A^4 + B^5 + C^6 for some positive integers A, B, C.
%C A255830 The sequence has the infinite subsequence (4^n*(2^n+16), n=0,1,2,...), with corresponding (A,B,C) = (2^(n+2),2^(n+1),2^n).
%C A255830 See A256652 for terms whose square has more than one representation of the given form. See A256613 for the subsequence of terms such that A^2 + B^3 + C^4 is a square, cf. A180241. See A256091 for the analog for sums of 3rd, 4th and 5th power.
%e A255830 (A, B, C) = (1, 4, 2) = 1^4 + 4^5 + 2^6 = 1 + 1024 + 64 = 1089 = 33^2, so 33 is a term.
%e A255830 (A, B, C) = (1, 4, 8) = 1^4 + 4^5 + 8^6 = 1 + 1024 + 262144 = 263169 = 513^2, so 513 is a term.
