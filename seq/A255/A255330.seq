%N A255330 a(n) = total number of nodes in the finite subtrees branching from the node n in the infinite trunk of "number-of-runs beanstalk" (A255056).
%C A255330 A255058 gives the number of branches (children) of the node n in the trunk, of which one is the next node of the infinite trunk itself. Thus, if A255058(n) = 1, then a(n) = 0.

%F A255330 a(0) = 1; a(n) = sum_{k = A091067(A255057(n)) .. A255068(A255057(n))} A255327(k).
%F A255330 a(n) = A255328(n) + A255329(n).
%e A255330 The edge-relation between nodes is given by A236840(child) = parent. Odd numbers are leaves, as there are no such k that A236840(k) were odd.
%e A255330 The node 11 in the infinite trunk is A255056(11) = 30. Apart from 32 [we have A236840(32) = 30] which is the next node (node 12) in the infinite trunk, it has a single leaf-child 31 [A236840(31) = 30] at the "left side" (less than 32), and a leaf-child 33 [A236840(33) = 30] (more than 32) at the "right side", and also at that side, a subtree of three nodes 34 <- 38 <- 43 [we have A236840(43) = 38, A236840(38) = 34 and A236840(34) = 30], thus in total there are 1+1+3 = 5 nodes in finite branches emanating from the node 11 of the infinite trunk, and a(11) = 5.
