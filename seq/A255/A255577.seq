%N A255577 Numbers n not coprime to 10 such that there exists an integer k > 1 where n^k contains n as its last digits in base 10.
%C A255577 Intersection of A065502 (numbers not coprime with 10) and A072495 (k-morphic numbers).
%C A255577 Also defined as all n not coprime with 10 where there exists k > 1 such that n^k mod 10^floor(log_10(n)) = n.
%C A255577 For n > 1, a(n) <= a(n-1) + 2^(ceiling(log_10(a(n))) + 1) (conjectured).
%C A255577 For a(n) >= 10^k where k >= 1, there exists a(m) = a(n) mod 10^j where m < n and j < k.
%C A255577 From _Robert Israel_, May 14 2015: (Start)
%C A255577 n with d digits is in the sequence if and only if n is either divisible by 2^d but not by 5, or divisible by 5^d but not by 2.
%C A255577 For d >= 2 the number of terms with d digits is 4*5^(d-1) + 2^(d-1) - 4*floor(5^d/50) - floor(2^d/20) - x(d) where x(d) = 3 if d == 2 or 3 mod 4, 2 otherwise.

%F A255577 For n > 6, a(n) > 2n since no term is divisible by 10 (but all are divisible by either 2 or 5). - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, May 13 2015
%e A255577 For n = 2, we have n^5 = 2^5 = 32, whose last digit is 2 = n, so 2 is in the sequence.
%e A255577 For n = 3, we have n^5 = 3^5 = 243, so 3 is in the sequence.
%e A255577 For n = 4, we have n^3 = 4^3 = 64, so 4 is in the sequence.
%e A255577 ...
%e A255577 As a counterexample, n = 41 is not in the sequence because it is coprime with 10, even though we have 41^6 = 4750104241, whose last 2 digits are 41.
