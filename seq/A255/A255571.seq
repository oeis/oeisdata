%N A255571 Numbers whose binary representation traces a nonselfcrossing circuit in honeycomb lattice when its bits (from the least to the second most significant bit) are interpreted as directions to proceed at each vertex. (The most significant 1-bit is ignored).
%C A255571 Numbers n such that when we start scanning bits in the binary expansion of n, from the least to the most significant end, and when we interpret each bit as to a direction which to turn at each vertex (e.g., 0 = left, 1 = right) when traversing the edges of honeycomb lattice, then, when we have consumed all except the most significant 1-bit (which is ignored), we have eventually returned to the same vertex where we started from and none of the other vertices have been visited twice.
%C A255571 Indexing starts from zero, because a(0) = 1 is a special case, indicating an empty path, which thus ends at the same vertex as where it started from.
%C A255571 If n is a member, then A054429(n) is also a member.

%e A255571 The examples given in A255570 occur also in this sequence, except that 380 ("101111100" in binary) is excluded from this sequence, because it visits twice the first vertex after the starting vertex.
