%N A131987 Representation of a dense para-sequence.
%C A131987 A fractal sequence. The para-sequence may be regarded as a sort of "limit" of the concatenated segments. The para-sequence (itself not a sequence) is dense in the sense that every pair of terms i and j are separated by another term (and hence separated by infinitely many terms).
%C A131987 The para-sequence accounts for positions of dyadic rational numbers in the following way: Label 1/2 as 1; label 1/4, 3/4 as 2 and 3; label 1/8, 3/8, 5/8, 7/8 as 4,5,6,7, etc. Then, for example, the ordering 1/8 < 1/4 < 3/8 < 1/2 < 5/8 < 3/4 < 7/8 matches the labels 4,2,5,1,6,3,7, which is the 3rd segment of A131987. The n-th segment consists of labels for rationals having denominators 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^n.
%C A131987 Could be seen as a "fuzzy table" with row lengths 2^n-1. In row n one has the numbers, read from the leftmost to the rightmost, as they appear in a perfect binary tree of 2^n-1 nodes when inserted in "storage order" into the tree, cf. illustration in A101279 and stackexchange link. These rows are obviously permutations of [1..2^n-1], their inverse is given in A269752. - _M. F. Hasler_, Mar 04 2016
%C A131987 Subsequence of A025480 (omitting all terms=0). - _David James Sycamore_, Apr 26 2020
%C A131987 The sequence obtained by adding 1 to every term of this sequence is the same as A003602 with all 1's removed. - _David James Sycamore_, Jul 25 2022
