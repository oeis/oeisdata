%N A131139 Counts 2-wild partitions. In general p-wild partitions of n are defined so that they are in bijection with geometric equivalence classes of degree n algebra extensions of the p-adic field Q_p. Here two algebra extensions are equivalent if they become isomorphic after tensoring with the maximal unramified extension of Q_p.
%C A131139 In general, the number of p-wild partitions of n is equal to the number of partitions of n if and only if n<p. From n=p onward, there are many more p-wild partitions.

%F A131139 The generating function is Product_{j>=0} theta_2(2^(2^j-1) x)^(2^j) where theta_2(y) is the generating function for 2-cores A010054  (this appears to be incorrect _Joerg Arndt_, Apr 06 2013)
%e A131139 a(2) = 4, since there are four quadratic algebras over Q_2 up to geometric equivalence, namely Q_2 times Q_2, Q_2(sqrt{-1}), Q_2(sqrt{2}) and Q_2(sqrt{-2})
