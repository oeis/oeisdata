%N A131280 Sums of exactly 4 positive octahedral numbers A005900.
%C A131280 Pollock (1850) conjectured that every number is the sum of at most 7 octahedral numbers. Which octahedral numbers are themselves the sum of exactly 4 positive octahedral numbers? To begin with, Oc(3) = Oc(2) + Oc(2) + Oc(2) + Oc(1) = 6 + 6 + 6 + 1 = 19.
