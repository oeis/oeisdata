%N A236844 Numbers that do not occur as results of "upward" remultiplication (GF(2)[X] -> N) of any number; numbers not present in A234742.
%C A236844 Numbers that do not occur in A234742 (A236842).
%C A236844 This is a subsequence of A236848, thus all terms are divisible by at least one such prime which is reducible as polynomial over GF(2) (i.e. one of the primes in A091209).
%C A236844 A236835(7)=27 is the first member of A236835 which does not occur here. a(12)=43 is the first term here which does not occur in A236835.
