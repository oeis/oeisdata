%N A236300 Numbers n of the form x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3*x*y*z for x,y,z >= 0, where x + y + z < n.
%C A236300 x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3*x*y*z = (x + y + z)*(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - x*y - x*z - y*z), hence all terms are composite.

%C A236300 Take x >= y >= z >= 0, not all identical: the numbers are of the form (x + y + z)*(u^2 + v^2 + w^2)/2, where u = x-y, v = x-z, w = y-z, with u >= 0, v >=0, w >= 0, u - v + w = 0  and u^2 + v^2 + w^2 >= 4.
%C A236300 (i) If, say, x = y but not equal to z, then the numbers are of the form (2*x+y)*(x-z)^2 with x-z >= 2, z >= 0. Similarly for the other case with y = z not equal to x.
%C A236300 (ii) If x, y and z are distinct, u >= 1, v >= 1 and w >= 1, hence u is not equal to v, and v is not equal to w (because u - v + w = 0). (iia) If u  = w then the numbers are of the form 3*y*3*(y-z)^2 with y-z >= 1, z >= 0. (iib) If the u, v, w are distinct >= 1 then the even members of the sequence A004432 with multiplicities A025442 are of interest. But only those (u, v, w) qualify which satisfy u - v + w = 0. E.g., A025442(5) = 30 = 1^2 + 2^2 + 5^2 does not qualify because no permutation of 1, 2, 5 works for u, v, w. A025442(1) = 14 qualifies because (u, v, w) = (2, 3, 1) satisfies 2 - 3 + 1 = 0. Then [x, y, z] = [4, 2, 1] and the number is 7*14/2 = 49.
