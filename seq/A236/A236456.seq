%N A236456 Number of ordered ways to write n = k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that p = phi(k) + phi(n-k)/4 - 1, q = p + 2 and r = prime(q) + 2 are all prime, where phi(.) is Euler's totient function.
%C A236456 Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n > 357.
%C A236456 This is much stronger than the twin prime conjecture. Actually it implies that there are infinitely many primes p such that {p, p + 2} and {prime(p+2), prime(p+2) + 2} are both twin prime pairs. See A236457 for such primes p.

%e A236456 a(18) = 1 since 18 = 3 + 15 with phi(3) + phi(15)/4 - 1  = 3,  3 + 2 = 5 and prime(5) + 2 = 13 all prime.
%e A236456 a(50) = 1 since 50 = 16 + 34 with phi(16) + phi(34)/4 - 1 = 11, 11 + 2 = 13 and prime(13) + 2 = 43 all prime.
%e A236456 a(929) = 1 since 929 = 441 + 488 with phi(441) + phi(488)/4 - 1 = 252 + 60 - 1 = 311, 311 + 2 = 313 and prime(313) + 2 = 2083 all prime.
