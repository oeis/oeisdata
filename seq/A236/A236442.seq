%N A236442 Number of ordered ways to write n = k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that A000009(k) + A047967(m) is prime.
%C A236442 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 2.
%C A236442 (ii) If n > 2 is neither 18 nor 30, then n can be written as k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that A000009(k)^2 + A047967(m)^2 is prime.
%C A236442 (iii) Any integer n > 4 can be written as k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that A000009(k)*A047967(m) - 1 (or A000009(k)*A047967(m) + 1) is prime.

%e A236442 a(15) = 1 since 15 = 13 + 2 with A000009(13) + A047967(13) = 18 + 1 = 19 prime.
%e A236442 a(18) = 1 since 18 = 3 + 15 with A000009(3) + A047967(15) = 2 + 149 = 151 prime.
