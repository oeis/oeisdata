%N A236845 Numbers that occur in more than one way as results of "upward" remultiplication (GF(2)[X] -> N) of some number.
%C A236845 Numbers that occur more than once in A234742.
%C A236845 Those terms that encode an irreducible polynomial in ring GF(2)[X] with their binary representation (that is, those that are in A014580) seem to occur also all in A091214 (that is, are a subsequence of the latter).
%C A236845 If n is a term, then 2n is also a term.
