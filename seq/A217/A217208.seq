%N A217208 a(n) = (conjectured) length of longest tail that can be generated by a starting string of 2's and 3's of length n before a 1 is reached, using the rule described in the Comments lines.
%C A217208 Start with an initial string S of n numbers s(1), ..., s(n), all = 2 or 3. The rule for extending the string is this:
%C A217208 To get s(i+1), write the current string s(1)s(2)...s(i) as XY^k for words X and Y (where Y has positive length) and k is maximized, i.e. k = the maximal number of repeating blocks at the end of the sequence so far (k is the "curling number" of the string). Then set s(i+1) = k.
%C A217208 The "tail length" t(S) of S is defined as follows: start with S and repeatedly append the curling number (recomputing it at each step) until a 1 is reached; t(S) is the number of terms that are appended to S before a 1 is reached. If a 1 is never reached, set t(S)=oo .
%C A217208 The "Curling Number Conjecture" is that if one starts with any finite string and repeatedly extends it by appending the curling number k, then eventually one must reach a 1. This has not yet been proved.
%C A217208 The values shown for n >= 49 are only conjectures, because certain assumptions used to cut down the search have not yet been rigorously justified. However, we believe that ALL terms shown are correct.
