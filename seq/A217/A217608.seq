%N A217608 After the 51-digit 2^168, a(n) is the number setting a record for non-pandigital right segment length of 2^a(n).
%C A217608 The rationale for the starting point are twofold: 1) A number which is itself non-pandigital could be considered in some sense as having infinitely many digits in its segment for the purposes of the record here (if the sole missing digit were not 0) and 2) After 168 a value giving a 'record' segment length under 51 would seem peculiar.  A217609 gives the length of the shortest padigital right segment of 2^A217608 (not the longest non-pandigital one).
%e A217608 2^183 requires its rightmost 53 digits for an occurrence of each digit 0-9 to be found.
