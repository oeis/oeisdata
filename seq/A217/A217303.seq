%N A217303 Minimal natural number (in decimal representation) with n prime substrings in base-3 representation (substrings with leading zeros are considered to be nonprime).
%C A217303 The sequence is well-defined in that for each n the set of numbers with n prime substrings is not empty. Proof: Define m(0):=1, m(1):=2 and m(n+1):=3*m(n)+2 for n>0. This results in m(n)=2*Sum_{j=0..n-1} 3^j = 3^n - 1 or m(n)=1, 2, 22, 222, 2222, 22222, ..., for n=0,1,2,3,... . Evidently, for n>0 m(n) has n 2's and these are the only prime substrings in base-3 representation. This is why every substring of m(n) with more than one digit is a product of two integers > 1 (by definition) and can therefore not be prime number.
%C A217303 No term is divisible by 3.

%F A217303 a(n) > 3^floor(sqrt(8*n+1)-1)/2), for n>1.
%F A217303 a(n) <= 3^n - 1.
%F A217303 a(n+1) <= 3*a(n)+2.
%e A217303 a(1) = 2 = 2_3, since 2 is the least number with 1 prime substring in base-3 representation.
%e A217303 a(2) = 5 = 12_3, since 5 is the least number with 2 prime substrings in base-3 representation (2_3 and 12_3).
%e A217303 a(3) = 11 = 102_3, since 11 is the least number with 3 prime substrings in base-3 representation (2_3, 10_3, and 102_3).
%e A217303 a(5) = 23 = 212_3, since 23 is the least number with 5 prime substrings in base-3 representation (2 times 2_3, 12_3=5, 21_3=19, and 212_3=23).
%e A217303 a(7) = 104 = 10212_3, since 104 is the least number with 7 prime substrings in base-3 representation (2 times 2_3, 10_3=3, 12_3=5, 21_3=19, 102_3=11, and 212_3=23).
