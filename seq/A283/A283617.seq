%N A283617 Number of ways to write n as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 with x,y,z,w integers and 0 <= z <= w such that x^3 + 2*y^3 is a square.
%C A283617 Conjecture: (i) Let a and b >= a be positive integers with gcd(a,b) squarefree. Then, every n = 0,1,2,... can be written as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 with x,y,z,w integers such that a*x^3 + b*y^3 is a square, if and only if (a,b) is among the ordered pairs (1,2), (1,8), (2,16), (4,23), (4,31), (5,9), (8,9), (8,225), (9,47), (25,88), (50,54).
%C A283617 (ii) Each n = 0,1,2,... can be written as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 with x a nonnegative integer and y,z,w integers such that a*x^3 + b*y^3 is a square, whenever (a,b) is among the ordered pairs (1,8), (2,16), (8,1), (9,8), (88,25), (225,8).
%C A283617 (iii) Any positive integer can be written as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 with x,y,z integers and w a positive integer such that x^3 + 19*y^3 + 19*z^3 is an integer cube.
%C A283617 (iv) Every n = 0,1,2,... can be written as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 with x,y,z,w integers such that a*x^3 + b*y^3 + c*z^3 + d*w^3 is a square, whenever (a,b,c,d) is among the ordered quadruples (1,1,3,4), (1,2,3,5), (1,2,3,7), (1,2,4,5),(1,2,5,7), (1,3,4,5), (1,3,4,7), (1,3,6,8), (1,3,8,13), ((1,4,5,9), (1,7,8,11), (1,8,9,10), (1,8,9,11), (2,3,4,7), (2,4,7,9), (2,4,7,14), (2,7,9,11), (3,4,5,7), (3,8,9,11).
%C A283617 By the linked JNT paper, each n = 0,1,2,... can be written as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 with x,y,z,w integers such that x + 2*y is a square.
