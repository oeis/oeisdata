%N A300651 Number of inequivalent sublattices of index n in hexagonal lattice, where two sublattices are considered equivalent if they are related by any rotation or reflection.
%C A300651 If we count sublattices as equivalent only if they are related by a rotation, we get A054384 instead of this sequence. If we only allow rotations and reflections that preserve the parent (hexagonal) lattice, we get A003051; the first discrepancy is at n = 42 (see illustration), the second is at n = 49. If both restrictions are applied, i.e., only rotations preserving the parent lattice are allowed, we get A145394. The analog for square lattice is A054346.
%C A300651 Although A003051 has its counterpart A003050 which counts primitive sublattices only, this sequence has no such counterpart sequence because a primitive sublattice can turn to a non-primitive one via a non-parent-lattice-preserving rotation, so the straightforward definition of primitiveness does not work in this case.
