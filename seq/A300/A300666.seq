%N A300666 Number of ways to write n as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 with nonnegative integers x,y,z,w and z <= w such that x or 2*y is a square and x + 3*y is also a square.
%C A300666 Conjecture 1: a(n) > 0 for all n = 0,1,2,....
%C A300666 Conjecture 2: Any nonnegative integer n not equal to 3 can be written as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 with nonnegative integers x,y,z,w such that x or 2*y is a square and 3*x - y is also a square.
%C A300666 By the author's 2017 JNT paper, each n = 0,1,2,... can be written as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 with integers x,y,z,w such that x (or 2*x) is a square.
%C A300666 See also A281976, A300667, A300708 and A300712 for similar conjectures.
