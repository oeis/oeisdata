%N A300006 Matrices of the 2 X 2 sandpile group, with matrix [a,b;c,d] encoded as concat(a,b,c,d), leading 0 omitted.
%C A300006 The 2 X 2 sandpile group S2 has 192 elements (called sandpiles), which are obtained as sandpile-addition of any arbitrary 2 X 2 matrix to the neutral element E2 = [2,2;2,2]. Equivalently, these are exactly the matrices which are invariant under sandpile-addition of E2.
%C A300006 Sandpile-addition is standard matrix addition followed by the topple-process in which each element larger than 3 is decreased by 4 and each of its von Neumann neighbors is increased by 1, iterated until no element is > 3. The addition table for the group S2 is given in A300009.
%C A300006 The 2 X 2 matrices A = [a,b;c,d] are represented here as concat(a,b,c,d) (or Sum_{i,j=1..2} 10^(6-2i-j)*A[i,j]), and listed in lexicographic order. The first 30 elements (corresponding to the 3-digit terms < 1000) have a = 0 which is not displayed.
%C A300006 The opposite of the i-th element A300006(i) (in the above lexicographic order) is the A300007(i)-th element, A300008(i) = A300006(A300007(i)).

%e A300006 a(1) = 0112 represents the matrix A = [0,1;1,2]. As illustration, add this to E2 = [2,2;2,2]: A + E2 = [2,3;3,4], and the 4 "topples": it gets 4 subtracted and both neighbors (the two 3's) get incremented by 1, thus: [2,4;4;0]. Now the two 4's topple, each one incrementing the 2 and the 0 by one: [4,0;0,2]. Once again the 4 topples: [0,1;1,2]. This is the result: A (+) E2 = A.
%e A300006 a(116) = 2222 represents E2 = [2,2;2,2], which is the only nonzero 2 X 2 matrix such that M (+) M = M. (Indeed, 2222 + 2222 = 4444 -> 2222, as each 4 topples to 0 and gets +1 from each of its 2 neighbors.) It is (by definition) the neutral element in S2 := { A in M_2(Z) | A (+) E2 = A }, and it turns out that there is an opposite or inverse A' for each A in S(2), such that A (+) A' = E2. (This would not be the case for the zero matrix.)
