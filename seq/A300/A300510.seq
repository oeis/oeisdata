%N A300510 Number of ways to write n^2 as 4^k*(m^2+1) + x^2 + y^2, where m is 1 or 2, and k,x,y are nonnegative integers with x <= y.
%C A300510 Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n > 1; in other words, for any integer n > 1 there is a nonnegative integer k such that either n^2 - 2*4^k or n^2 - 5*4^k can be written as the sum of two squares. Moreover, a(n) = 1 only for n = 2^k with k > 0.
%C A300510 This conjecture is stronger than the first conjecture in A300448. We have verified that a(n) > 0 for all n = 2..5*10^7.
%C A300510 Consider positive integers c not divisible by 4 such that for any integer n > 1 there is a nonnegative integer k for which n^2 - 2*4^k or n^2 - c*4^k can be written as the sum of two squares. Our computation for n up to 3*10^7 shows that the only candidates for values of c smaller than 160 are 5, 17, 18, 26, 29, 41, 45, 65, 74, 89, 98, 101, 113, 122, 125, 146, 149, 153. These numbers have the form 9^a*(3*b+2) with a and b nonnegative integers and the p-adic order of 3*b+2 is even for any prime p == 3 (mod 4). For n = 42211965 there is no nonnegative integer k such that n^2 - 2*4^k or n^2 - 162*4^k can be written as the sum of two squares.
%C A300510 Qing-Hu Hou at Tianjin Univ. reported that he had verified a(n) > 0 for n up to 10^9. - _Zhi-Wei Sun_, Mar 14 2018
%C A300510 Qing-Hu Hou found that 29, 65, 113 should be excluded from the candidates. In fact, for c = 29, 65, 113 there is no nonnegative integer k such that N(c)^2 - 2*4^k or N(c)^2 - c*4^k can be written as the sum of two squares, where N(29) = 51883659, N(65) = 56173837 and N(113) = 65525725. - _Zhi-Wei Sun_, Mar 23 2018

%e A300510 a(1) = 0 since 1^2 - 4^k*(m^2+1) < 0 for k = 0,1,2,... and m = 1, 2.
