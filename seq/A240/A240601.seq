%N A240601 Recursive palindromes in base 10: palindromes n where each half of the digits of n is also a recursive palindrome.
%C A240601 A number n with m digits in base 10 is a member if n is a palindrome, and the first floor(m/2) digits of n is already a previous term of a(n). All repdigit numbers are terms of a(n). Fast generation of new terms with 2m digits can be done by concatenating the previous terms with m digits twice. Fast generation of new terms with 2m+1 digits can be done by concatenating the previous terms with m digits twice with any single digit in the middle. The smallest palindrome which is not a member of a(n) is 1001.

%e A240601 11011 is in the sequence since it is a palindrome of 5 digits, and the first floor(5/2) digits of it, 11, is also a term. 1001 and 10001 are not in the sequence since 10 is not in the sequence.
