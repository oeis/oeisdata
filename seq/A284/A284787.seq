%N A284787 Even numbers representable in at least two ways as the sum of two odd composites.
%C A284787 If n is even and n > 68, at least two of n-15, n-25, n-35, n-45, n-55, n-65, are odd numbers divisible by 3 and greater than 3, with n = (n-55) + 55 for example.
%C A284787 So if n is even and n > 68, then n can be written in at least two ways as the sum of two odd positive composite numbers.
