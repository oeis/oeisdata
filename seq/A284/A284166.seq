%F A284166 Union of A083601, A083605, A118079, A083614, A083619, A083624, A083629, A083635, A083641 and A083646.
%e A284166 From the 710100-th decimal on, there are 7 consecutive '3's in Pi's decimal expansion, and there is no earlier occurrence of 7 consecutive identical digits, therefore a(1) = 710100.
%e A284166 From the 1722776-th decimal digit on, there are 7 consecutive '9's in Pi's decimal expansion.
%e A284166 From the 3204765-th decimal digit on, there are again 7 consecutive '3's.
%e A284166 From the 3346228-th decimal digit on, there are 7 consecutive '7's.
%e A284166 Further terms correspond to seven '9's at 3389380, '5's at 3517236, '7's at 3775287, '0's at 3794572, '9's at 4313727, '1's at 4657555, '8's at 4722613, '9's at 5466169, '8's at 7820866, '6's at 8209165, '5's at 9325203 and at 10519242, '3's at 12469058, '0's at 13310436, '7's at 14233532, '9's at 14593770 and at 15256174, and finally seven '4's at 17893953 = A083619(1).
%e A284166 The first string of seven '2's does not appear until position 82599811 = A118079(1).
%e A284166 At position 22931745 there are 8 consecutive '4's, and therefore also 7 '4's starting at 22931746. Similarly, at position 24658601 there are 9 consecutive '7's, therefore the next two terms are 24658602, 24658603.
%Y A284166 Cf. A083601, A083605, A118079, A083614, A083619, A083624, A083629, A083635, A083641 and A083646: position of seven '0's, ..., '9's; the disjoint union of these yields this sequence.
%Y A284166 Cf. A049534: position of six or more consecutive identical digits, 1-indexed: { a(n)+1 | a(n-1) < a(n)-1 } is a subsequence.
