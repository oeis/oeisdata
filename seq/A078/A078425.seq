%N A078425 Primes in "Ulam's Prime sequence". A prime is in the sequence iff p+1 can be expressed in exactly 1 way as the sum of 2 previous distinct primes.
%C A078425 a(1) = 3, a(2) = 5; for n >= 3, a(n) is smallest prime which is uniquely a(j) + a(k) - 1, with 1<= j < k < n.
%C A078425 Is the (3,5) sequence finite or infinite? Note that (3,7) as a starting sequence has only 2 terms and (7,11) yields 7, 11, 17, 23, 29 only. Equally using -1 as a rule creates more variants.
%C A078425 The sequence continues at least up to a(2227) = 400031.
%C A078425 After about 500 terms, the graph of this sequences appears almost linear. - _T. D. Noe_, Jan 20 2008
