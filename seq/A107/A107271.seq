%N A107271 Let M = the 3 X 3 matrix [1 1 1; 3 1 0; 2 0 0]. Perform M^n * [1 0 0] getting (1, 3, 2; 6, 6, 2; 14, 24, 12; 50, 66, 28; ...) which we string together to form the sequence.
%C A107271 Sequence relating to finite differences.
%C A107271 Taking subsets (k = 1,2,3, ...) of three terms: [1, 3, 2; 6, 6, 2; 14, 24, 12; ...], 3 terms in the k-th subset are coefficients in a second degree equation f(x) such that the binomial transform of (k+1)-th subset = terms generated by f(x) of k-th subset. Example: Binomial transform of [14, 24, 12] = 14, 38, 74, 122, ...; f(x) = 6*x^2 + 6*x + 2. [14, 24, 12] = the 3rd subset of 3 terms, [6, 6, 2] = the second subset. Then, binomial transform of [6, 6, 2] = [6, 12, 20, 30, 42...] such that f(x) = x^2 + 3*x + 2, where [1, 3, 2] is the second three term subset of A107271.
