%N A272069 Odd numbers n such that 3^n+1 is a sum of two squares.
%C A272069 Keenan Curtis found the values up though 577 in his undergraduate thesis (working with Jeremy Rouse at Wake Forest University). Keenan proved that if 3^n+1 is a sum of two squares for n odd, then n must be equivalent to 1 mod 4, that n itself is a sum of two squares, and that 3^p+1 is a sum of two squares for all primes p dividing n.

%e A272069 3^1+1 = 4 = 0^2 + 2^2, so 1 is a term;
%e A272069 3^5+1 = 244 = 10^2 + 12^2, so 5 is a term;
%e A272069 3^13+1 = 1594324 = 82^2 + 1260^2, so 13 is a term.
