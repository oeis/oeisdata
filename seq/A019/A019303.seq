%N A019303 "Pascal sweep" for k=2: draw a horizontal line through the 1 at C(k,0) in Pascal's triangle; rotate this line and record the sum of the numbers on it (excluding the initial 1).
%C A019303 The line is never horizontal, but slopes down: For any n >= 0, a(n) is the sum of all C(m,p) where (m,p) are the integer points of the line going through (2,0) and (3+n,3+n). It does not matter whether the triangle is written with left-aligned or centered lines. - _M. F. Hasler_, Oct 12 2018
%C A019303 It might have been more natural to start with a horizontal line for n=0 (which would have prefixed a 3 to the sequence), or even, to start with the line going through (0,0), resulting in (2, 1, 3, 1, 4, ...). - _M. F. Hasler_, Oct 13 2018
