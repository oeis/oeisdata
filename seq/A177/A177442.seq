%N A177442 Smallest a(n) such that the prime factorization of a(n)! contains at least one factor to each exponent between 1 and n.
%e A177442 15! = 2^11 * 3^6 * 5^3 * 7^2 * 11 * 13 and is the smallest number whose prime factorization has at least one factor with exponent 1, one factor with exponent 2, and one factor with exponent 3, so a(3)=15.
