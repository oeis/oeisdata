%N A177078 Central polygonal-free numbers.
%C A177078 Positive integers not multiples of any element except 1 of A000124. Complement of multiples of central polygonal numbers (other than multiples of 1, which are all integers) = {2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, ...}. This is to squarefree numbers (A005117), i.e., numbers that are not divisible by a square greater than 1, as central polygonal numbers (A000124) are to squares (A000290).
%F A177078 {a(n)} = {k such that k>0 and for no j>1 does A000124(j) | k} = {k such that k>0 and for no j>1 does (j(j+1)/2 + 1) | k}.
%e A177078 Construct by sieve. Start with all integers from 2 through N. Eliminate all multiples of A000124(1) = 2. Now we have all odd numbers. It is redundant to eliminate all multiples of A000124(2) = 4 as those were all eliminated in the previous step. Now eliminate all multiples of A000124(3) = 7. Now eliminate all multiples of A000124(4) = 11. Continue through eliminating all multiples of A000124 elements > 1 through N and one has all elements of this new sequence through N^2.
