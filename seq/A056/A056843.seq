%N A056843 Number of polydudes(1): a(n) is the number of polydudes with n cells. See the first link for the source of this sequence. The definition is unknown. Not the same as A091130.
%C A056843 The polydudes(1) (this sequence) and the polydudes(2) (A091130) are both subsets of the polydrafters (A056842).
%C A056843 Speculation about the definition: There are 3 2-drafters that have no 30-degree angles. It appears that all polydudes are unions of these 3 2-drafters. All the pictured 5-dudes and 6-dudes have this property and the numbers of n-drafters with this property agree with the first 5 terms. I believe there is only one 6-drafter with this property that is not in the picture. This one was probably excluded because it has a 30-degree external angle, which none of the other polydudes can fit into. I can't guess what other exclusions might occur for n > 6. (D.R.W.)
