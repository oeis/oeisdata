%N A056910 Numbers k such that 36*k^2 + 12*k + 7 is prime (sorted by absolute values with negatives before positives).
%C A056910 36*k^2 + 12*k + 7 = (6*k+1)^2 + 6, which is six more than a square.
%F A056910 a(n) = (-1 +- sqrt(A056909(n) - 6))/6, choosing +- to give an integer result for each n.
%e A056910 a(2)=-2 since 36*(-2)^2 + 12*(-2) + 7 = 127, which is prime (as well as being six more than a square).
%Y A056910 This sequence and formula generate all primes of the form k^2+6, i.e., A056909. Except for the first term, none of the a(n) are a multiple of 7 and so the rest of this sequence is a subsequence of A047304. Cf. A056900, A056902, A056904, A056906, A056907, A056908.
