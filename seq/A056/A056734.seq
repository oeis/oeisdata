%N A056734 Positive numbers k such that, in base 3, 2^k and 2^(k+1) have the same number of digits and the same number of 0's.
%C A056734 Using empirical data for 1 <= k <= 10000, it has been found that the distribution of these terms correlates well (R^2 = 0.9513) with f(k) = c*k^(1/2) with c approximately 0.73. In addition, f'(k) approximates the probability that any particular k has this property. Any terms in A056154 must also be in this sequence.
