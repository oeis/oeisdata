%N A056779 Number of poly-IH73-tiles (holes allowed) with n cells.
%C A056779 Originally from Vicher's table, which lists this as "Puzzle 3".
%C A056779 Isohedral tiling IH73 (see Figure 6.2.4 of Grünbaum and Shephard) is obtained from the regular square tiling by replacing the edges of each square by symmetric curves bulging alternately inwards and outwards, so that each modified square now has a rotation of order two and reflections in horizontal and vertical axes as symmetries but no longer has rotations of order four or diagonal reflections as symmetries. - _Joseph Myers_, Oct 08 2011
