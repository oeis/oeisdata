%N A056055 Integers k > 1 such that the decimal expansion of 1/k contains k as a string. (If the decimal expansion terminates, trailing zeros do not count.)
%C A056055 The sequence is probably infinite, since long-period primes (cf. A006883) especially with high first digit are likely candidates, but is there a proof? Does any k with finite expansion of 1/k (i.e., k = 2^j * 5^m) occur?

%e A056055 118 is a term since 1/118 = 0.00847457627118... contains "118".
%e A056055 100 is not a term because 1/100 = 0.01 does not contain "100" (0.0100 does not count).
