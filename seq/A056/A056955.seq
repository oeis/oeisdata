%N A056955 Euclid set of class 2 and modulus 3.
%C A056955 For c<m, (m,c)=1, the  Euclid(c, m) set is obtained by  deleting  from the set of numbers c+m*k, for k>0, every term which has a common factor with a smaller term. See Link for more details.
%C A056955 Essentially the same as A003627, which drops the 8 for 2. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Nov 21 2014

%e A056955 The Euclid(2,3) set is constructed by starting from the set of numbers of the form 2+3*k for k>0, i.e., 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 35,... and deleting every term which has a common factor with a previous one, like 14, 20, 26, 32, 35,... and so on.
