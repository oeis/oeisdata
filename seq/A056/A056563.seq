%N A056563 Number of primes which are the difference between two triangular numbers, where the larger is the n-th triangular number.
%F A056563 a(n)=2 if both n is prime and 2n-1 is prime, =1 if one of n and 2n-1 is prime, =0 if neither are primes.
%e A056563 a(7)=2 because 7th triangular number is 28 and both 28-21=7 and 28-15=13 are primes.
