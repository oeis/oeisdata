%N A186285 Numbers of the form p^(3^k) where p is prime and k >= 0.
%C A186285 Every positive rational number (in reduced form) is a product of a unique subset of these numbers and their multiplicative inverses.
%C A186285 The factorization of positive rational numbers into prime powers of the form p^(3^k), k >= 0, (A186285) and their multiplicative inverses, allows each of those prime powers and their multiplicative inverses to be used at most once, since this corresponds to the balanced ternary representation of the exponents of the prime powers p^a and their multiplicative inverses of the prime factorization of positive rational numbers.
%C A186285 These are to the "Fermi-Dirac primes" [as _Daniel Forgues_ has denoted numbers of the form p^(2^k) where p is prime and k >= 0 (A050376)] as 3 is to 2. - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Mar 16 2013
%C A186285 Every integer > 1 is a unique product of terms of this sequence with no more than 2 the same. For example, 104 = 8*13, 27 = 27, 32 = 2^2*8. - _Vladimir Shevelev_, Sep 09 2013
