%N A186312 There appear to be at least n lower twin primes between x/2 and x for all x >= a(n).
%C A186312 The name says "appear" because this sequence assumes that the twin prime conjecture is true. Note that every term is also a lower twin prime. This sequence for lower twin primes is like the Ramanujan primes (A104272) for the sequence of prime numbers. However, in this case, we do not know if there are an infinite number of twin primes. It appears that A001359(2n) < a(n) < A001359(4n).
