%e A186729 The null graph is vacuously regular; there is one 0-regular simple graph with 1 vertex, and one 1-regular simple graph with 2 vertices;  each of those three graphs, being acyclic, has infinite girth.
%e A186729 The n-cycle is the connected 2-regular graph with girth n.
%e A186729 The (3,9)-cages have order 58 and there are 18 of them.
%Y A186729 Connected regular graphs of any degree with girth at least g: A005177 (g=3), A186724 (g=4), A186725 (g=5), A186726 (g=6), A186727 (g=7), A186728 (g=8), this sequence (g=9).
%Y A186729 Connected k-regular simple graphs with girth at least 9: this sequence (all k), A186719 (triangular array), A185119 (k=2).
