%N A186884 Numbers k such that 2^(k-1) == 1 + b*k (mod k^2), where b divides k - 2^p for some integer p >= 0 and 2^p <= b.
%C A186884 This sequence contains A186645 as a subsequence (corresponding to p=0).
%C A186884 All composites in this sequence are 2-pseudoprimes, A001567. This sequence contains all terms of A054723. Another composite term is 4294967297 = 2^32 + 1, which does not belong to A054723. In other words, all known composite terms have the form (2^x + 1) or (2^x - 1). Are there composites not of this form?
%C A186884 This sequence contains all the primes of the forms (2^x + 1) and (2^x - 1), i.e., subsequences A092506 and A000668.
