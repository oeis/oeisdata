%N A186807 Triangle read by rows: T(n,p) (n >= 2, 1 <= p <= n-1) = number of compositions of n into p parts, with first part >= all other parts.
%C A186807 This triangle arose in connection with a problem involving "lunar arithmetic".
%C A186807 Take the triangle formed by the antidiagonals of A156041 and reverse each row.
