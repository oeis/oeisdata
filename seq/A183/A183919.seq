%N A183919 Characteristic sequence for sin(2*Pi/n) being rational.
%C A183919 The sequence is 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, followed by zeros.
%C A183919 In the I. Niven reference a formula for the algebraic degree of 2*sin(2*Pi/n) is found in theorem 3.9. This theorem is attributed to D. H. Lehmer, but the sine part in the Lehmer reference is wrong (to wit: n = 12 has rational value 2*sin(2*Pi/12) = 2*sin(Pi/6) = 1). Hence the degree is 1 = phi(12)/4, as in Niven's book, but not phi(12)/2 = 2 as in Lehmer's paper (the Sines-table there is wrong).

%F A183919 a(n) = 1 if sin(2*Pi/n) is rational, and a(n) = 0 if it is irrational.
%e A183919 The rational values of 2*sin(2*Pi/n) are 0, 0, 2 and 1 for n=1, 2, 4 and 12, respectively. Otherwise irrational values appear.
