%N A183118 Magnetic Tower of Hanoi, total number of moves, optimally solving the [NEUTRAL ; NEUTRAL ; NEUTRAL] pre-colored puzzle.
%C A183118 A. The Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle is described in link 1 listed below. The Magnetic Tower is pre-colored. Pre-coloring is [NEUTRAL ; NEUTRAL ; NEUTRAL], given in [Source ; Intermediate ; Destination] order. Thus, the tower in this case is "natural" or "free". The solution algorithm producing the sequence is optimal (the sequence presented gives the minimum number of moves to solve the "free" Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle). Optimal solutions are discussed and their optimality is proved in link 2 listed below.
%C A183118 B. Number of moves to solve the given puzzle, for large N, is close to 0.5*(20/33)*3^N ~ 0.5*0.606*3^(N). Series designation: S606(N).
%C A183118 C. The large N ratio of number of moves to solve the [NEUTRAL ; NEUTRAL ; NEUTRAL] puzzle to the number of moves to solve the [RED ; BLUE ; BLUE] or [RED ; RED ; BLUE] puzzle is 20/33 or about 60.6% (see link 2).
