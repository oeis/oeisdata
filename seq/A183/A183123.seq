%N A183123 Magnetic Tower of Hanoi, total number of moves, generated by a certain algorithm, yielding a "forward moving" non-optimal solution of the [NEUTRAL ; NEUTRAL ; NEUTRAL] pre-colored puzzle.
%C A183123 The Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle is described in link 1 listed below. The Magnetic Tower is pre-colored. Pre-coloring is [NEUTRAL ; NEUTRAL ; NEUTRAL], given in [Source ; Intermediate ; Destination] order. The solution algorithm producing the presented sequence is NOT optimal. The particular "62" algorithm solving the puzzle at hand is presented and discussed in the paper referenced by link 1 below. For the optimal solution of the Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle with the given pre-coloring configuration (the "natural" or "free" Magnetic Tower) see A183117 and A183118. Optimal solutions are discussed and their optimality is proved in link 2 listed below.
%C A183123 Large N limit of the sequence is 0.5*(67/108)*3^N ~ 0.5*0.62*3^N. Series designation: S62(n).
