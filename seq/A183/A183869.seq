%C A183869 a(n-2) appears to be the minimum number of rectangular tiles to place on an n X n grid of unit squares, possibly of different sizes, such that each side of every tile lies on a grid line, every unit square is covered by at most one tile, and each row and each column of the grid has exactly one unit square that is not covered by any tile. - _Yifan Xie_, Jul 19 2025 [The conjecture is proven. - _Yifan Xie_, Jul 24 2025]
