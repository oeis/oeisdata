%N A183021 Smallest members of k-sociable cycles of order r, with k > 1 and r > 1.
%C A183021 A k-sociable (or multisociable) cycle of order r consists of r distinct positive integers such that the sum of the aliquot divisors (or proper divisors) of each is equal to k times the next term in the cycle, where k (the multiplicity) is a fixed positive integer.
%C A183021 a(1), a(2) and a(4) are the smallest terms of 2-sociable cycles of order 3 (or bicrowds), and a(3) is the smaller term of a 3-sociable cycle of order 2 (or triamicable pair).
%C A183021 No other terms <= 10^12.
