%N A385730 The number of lattice points in the 2D plane contained between the curve y=x^2/4 and the line y=n^2, inclusive, where n is a positive integer.
%C A385730 This sequence came about by trying to study the probability that a quadratic equation x^2+bx+c=0 has real roots.
%C A385730 Proven directly by summation and using the symmetry of the problem.
%C A385730 Inspired by YouTube video by Michael Penn where he considered the probability of real roots for all real b and c. This sequence comes from the case of considering the probability that the quadratic equation has real roots when b and c are restricted to be integers
