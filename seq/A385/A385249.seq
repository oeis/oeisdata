%N A385249 Number of iterations of seven segments count x -> A010371(x) to go from n to a fixed point.
%C A385249 A010371 is a strictly decreasing function A010371(x) < x whenever x >= 10 and all single digit x reach a fixed point A010371(x) = x with x in {4, 5, 6}.
%C A385249 This sequence is unbounded.
%e A385249 For n = 12, the a(12) = 2 steps are 12 -> 7 -> 4 segments, and 4 is a fixed point A010371(4) = 4.
%Y A385249 Cf. A010371.
%Y A385249 Cf. A328330 (segments variation).
