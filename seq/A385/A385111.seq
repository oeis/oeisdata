%N A385111 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the least cardinality of a set of binary strings of length k such that any binary string of length n contains one of the strings in the set as a substring; 0 <= k <= n.
%C A385111 For any binary string s of length k, there is a string of length n such that all its length-k substrings are cyclic shifts of s. (Simply repeat s until the length is n.) This implies that T(n,k) >= A000031(k).
%C A385111 It is clear that T(n,k) is nonincreasing in n for any fixed k, so T(n,k) reaches a limiting value as n increases. Apparently, this limiting value is A000031(k). For 0 <= k <= 4, the smallest values of n for which T(n,k) = A000031(k) are 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, respectively.
%C A385111 Equivalently, for k >= 1, T(n,k) is the least number of edges that must be removed from the binary (k-1)-dimensional de Bruijn graph such that the remaining graph does not contain any walk of length n-k+1. For a fixed k and sufficiently large n, this is the least number of edges that must be removed in order to make the remaining graph acyclic.
%F A385111 T(n,n) = 2^n.
%F A385111 T(n,k) <= T(n-1,k).
%F A385111 T(n,k) >= A000031(k).

%e A385111 Any binary string of length n >= 3 contains one of the substrings 00, 01, 11 of length k = 2. The length-n strings 00...0, 11...1, and 0101... show that 00, 11, and either 01 or 10 are necessary, so T(n,2) = 3 for n >= 3.
