%N A013659 Initialized continued fraction for sqrt(n-th nonsquare) has period (1,a(n)).
%C A013659 From _Clark Kimberling_, Jun 23 2011: (Start)
%C A013659 The definition of initialized continued fraction depends on the usual recurrences for ordinary simple continued fractions:
%C A013659 ...
%C A013659 (eq 1).... p(i)=a(i)*p(i-1)+p(i-2) for i>=2;
%C A013659 (eq 2)...  q(i)=a(i)*q(i-1)+q(i-2) for i>=2.
%C A013659 ...
%C A013659 Suppose that p(0), q(0), p(1), q(1) are nonnegative integers such that {p(0), p(1)} is not {0} and {q(0), q(1)} is not {0}.  Suppose [b(0),b(1),b(2),...] is an ordinary simple continued fraction of a number B. The equations (1) and (2) with b(i) substituted for a(i) are used to define "initialized convergents" p(i)/q(i).  The limit of these exists and defines the "initialized continued fraction" of B, denoted by [(p(0),q(0),p(1),q(1)) ; b(0),b(1),b(2),...].

%C A013659 sqrt(5)=[(1,1,3,1) ; 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,...]

%C A013659 Formerly, an initialized continued fraction was here called a pseudo-continued fraction. (End)
