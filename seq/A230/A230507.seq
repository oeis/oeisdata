%N A230507 Number of ways to write n = a + b + c with a <= b <= c, where a, b, c are among those numbers m (terms of A230506) with 2*m + 1 and 2*m^3 + 1 both prime.
%C A230507 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 2.
%C A230507 (ii) Any integer n > 8 can be written as x + y + z (x, y, z > 0) with 2*x + 1, 2*y + 1, 2*z - 1, 2*x^4 - 1, 2*y^4 - 1, 2*z^4 - 1 all prime.
%C A230507 Either of the two parts of the conjecture is stronger than Goldbach's weak conjecture which was finally proved by H. Helfgott in 2013.
%C A230507 Part (i) implies that there are infinitely many positive integers n with 2*n + 1 and 2*n^3 + 1 both prime, and part (ii) implies that there are infinitely many positive integers n with 2*n + 1 and 2*n^4 - 1 both prime.
%C A230507 We have verified the conjecture for n up to 10^6.
