%N A230312 Squares which cannot be written as the sum of a smaller nonzero square and twice a triangular number.
%C A230312 The conjecture a(n) = A001912(n)^2 (mentioned in the formula part) is easy. In fact, any prime divisor of 4*n^2 + 1 is congruent to 1 modulo 4 and hence it can be written as a sum of two squares. Thus 4*n^2 + 1 = (2*n)^2 + 1^2 is composite if and only if it can be written as a sum of two squares in at least two ways. So the conjecture follows immediately. - _Zhi-Wei Sun_, Feb 23 2014
%C A230312 Positive squares that are the sum of two triangular numbers in exactly one way. Note that each positive square is the sum of two consecutive triangular numbers since A000217(n) + A000217(n+1) = n*(n+1)/2 + (n+1)*(n+2)/2 = (n+1)^2. - _Altug Alkan_, Jul 06 2016
%F A230312 Conjecture: a(n) = A001912(n)^2, that is, squares of numbers n such that 4n^2 + 1 is prime. - _Alonso del Arte_, Dec 20 2013
%e A230312 16 is not in the sequence because it can be expressed as 2^2 + 2 * 6.
%e A230312 But there is no such expression for 25 and hence it is in the sequence.
