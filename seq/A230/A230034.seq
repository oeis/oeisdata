%N A230034 Numbers which can't be represented as a sum of 3 relatively prime positive integers such that each pair of them is not coprime.
%C A230034 Complement of A230035.
%C A230034 Sequence is finite and contains exactly 156 terms.
%C A230034 Generally for every positive integer k there is only a finite quantity of numbers which can't be represented as a sum of k + 1 relatively prime positive integers such that any k of them are not coprime.
%C A230034 For instance, for k = 3, 570570 is the largest number which cannot be represented.

%e A230034 Every positive integer less than 31 is in the sequence because 31 obviously is the least number which can be represented as 2*3 + 2*5 + 3*5, i.e. as a sum of 3 relatively prime positive integers such that every pair of them is not coprime.
