%N A230412 a(n) = the number of ways to express n as a sum d1*(k1!-1) + d2*(k2!-1) + ... + dj*(kj!-1), where all k's are distinct and greater than one and each di is in range [1,ki]; the characteristic function of A219650.

%F A230412 a(0)=1 and for n>=1, a(n) = [(A219650(A230413(n-1)) + A230405(A230413(n-1))) = n], where [] stands for Iverson bracket.
%e A230412 a(0)=1 as the only solution is an empty sum.
%e A230412 1 can be represented as 1*(2!-1), and this is the only solution, thus a(1) = 1.
%e A230412 2 can be represented (also uniquely) as 2*(2!-1) thus a(2) = 1.
%e A230412 3 and 4 cannot be represented as such a sum, thus a(3) = a(4) = 0.
%e A230412 5 can be represented (uniquely) as 1*(3!-1) thus a(5) = 1.
%e A230412 6 can be represented (uniquely) as 1*(3!-1) + 1*(2!-1), thus a(6) = 1.
%e A230412 7 can be represented (uniquely) as 1*(3!-1) + 2*(2!-1), thus a(7) = 1.
%e A230412 17 can be represented (uniquely) as 3*(3!-1) + 2*(2!-1), thus a(17) = 1.

%Y A230412 The characteristic function of A219650. A219658 gives the positions of zeros.
%Y A230412 Together with A230413 (the partial sums) can be used to compute A230414, A230423 and A230424.
%Y A230412 This sequence relates to the factorial base representation (A007623) in a similar way as A079559 relates to the binary system.
