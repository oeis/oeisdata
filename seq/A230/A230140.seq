%N A230140 Number of ways to write n = x + y + z with 0 < x <= y <= z such that 6*x-1, 6*y-1, 6*z-1 are among those primes p (terms of A230138) with p + 2 and 2*p - 5 also prime.
%C A230140 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 2, i.e., 6*n-3 with n > 2 can be expressed as a sum of three terms from A230138. Moreover, for any integer n > 12, there are three distinct positive integers x, y, z with x + y + z = n such that 6*x-1, 6*y-1, 6*z-1 are primes in A230138.
%C A230140 (ii) For each integer n > 12, there are three distinct positive integers x, y, z with x + y + z = n such that 6*x-1, 6*y-1, 6*z-1 are among those primes p with p + 2 and 2*p + 9 also prime.
%C A230140 Note that part (i) of this conjecture implies that there are infinitely many primes in A230138.
%C A230140 Indices k such that a(m)>a(k) for all m>k, are (2, 10, 26, 334, 439, 544, 551, 684, ...). The only sequence which has the first 5 terms within the 3 lines of data is A212067. (Certainly a coincidence.) - _M. F. Hasler_, Oct 10 2013

%e A230140 a(10) = 1 since 10 = 2 + 3 + 5, and the three numbers 6*2-1=11, 6*3-1=17 and 6*5-1=29 are terms of A230138.
