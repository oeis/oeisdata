%N A230030 Numbers k not divisible by 5 such that k^2 written in base 5 has no digit > 1.
%C A230030 If P(x) = 25x^4 + 15x^3 - 4x^2 + 3x + 1 then P(5^k) belongs to the sequence for every k > 2.
%C A230030 The initial condition is added to avoid trivial solutions of the form a(k)*5^m (m>0), whose square would always have the digits 1 and 0 in base 5. The previous subsequence of solutions P(5^k) consists of numbers written "10{k}24{k}10{k-1}30{k-1}1" in base 5, where "d{k}" means "digit d repeated k times". These terms (written in base 10) end in ...376. For k=8 this yields 582077503203735352734376 which might be the next term of the sequence. See A257283 and A257284 for the (less interesting) base 3 and base 4 analog. For the b=7 analog, the smallest nontrivial term is 20; for b=8 the first nontrivial terms are 3 and 11677. What are the subsequent terms, and the smallest nontrivial term for the b=6 analog? - _M. F. Hasler_, May 02 2015
