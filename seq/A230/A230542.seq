%N A230542 Numbers that cannot be divided by their multiplicative projection (A000026).
%C A230542 Subset of A159836. For n < 1000 only 6 terms (144, 216, 256, 400, 576, 648, 720 and 768) are missing with respect to A159836.

%e A230542 Prime factors of 88 are 2^3 and 11; its multiplicative projection is 2*3*11 = 66 and 66 does not divide 88. Therefore 88 is in the sequence.
%e A230542 Prime factors of 108 are 2^2 and 3^3; its multiplicative projection is 2*2*3*3 = 36 and 108 / 36 = 3. therefore 108 is not in the sequence.
