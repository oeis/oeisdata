%N A230624 Numbers k with property that for every base b >= 2, there is a number m such that m+s(m) = k, where s(m) = sum of digits in the base-b expansion of m.
%C A230624 If k is a positive term then k is even (or else k has no generator in base k+1) but not a multiple of 4 (or else k has no generator in base k/2). - _David Applegate_, Jan 09 2022. See A349821 and A350607 for the k/2 and (k-2)/4 sequences.
%C A230624 It is not known if this sequence is infinite.
%C A230624 The eight terms 10 through 206 are all twice primes (cf. A349820).
