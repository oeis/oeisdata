%N A230451 Number of ways to write n = x + y + z (x, y, z > 0) such that 2*x + 1, 2*y + 3, 2*z + 5 are all prime and x*y*z is a triangular number.
%C A230451 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 except for n = 1, 2, 4, 7.
%C A230451 (ii) Any integer n > 7 can be written as x + y + z (x, y, z > 0) such that 2*x + 1, 2*y + 1, 2*x*y + 1 are primes and x*y*z is a triangular number.
%C A230451 (iii) Each integer n > 4 not equal to 7 or 14 can be expressed as p + q + r (p, q, r > 0) with p and 2*q + 1 both primes, and p*q*r a triangular number.
%C A230451 (iv) Any integer n > 6 not among 16, 20, 60 can be written as x + y + z (x, y, z > 0) such that x*y + x*z + y*z is a triangular number.
%C A230451 Part (i) is stronger than Goldbach's weak conjecture which was finally proved by H. Helfgott in 2013.
