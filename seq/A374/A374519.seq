%N A374519 Numbers k such that the leaders of anti-runs in the k-th composition in standard order (A066099) are identical.
%C A374519 The leaders of anti-runs in a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal consecutive anti-runs (sequences with no adjacent equal terms) and taking the first term of each.
%C A374519 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
%H A374519 Gus Wiseman, <a href="/A374629/a374629.txt">Sequences counting and ranking compositions by their leaders (for six types of runs)</a>.
%e A374519 The 346th composition in standard order is (2,2,1,2,2), with anti-runs ((2),(2,1,2),(2)), with leaders (2,2,2), so 346 is in the sequence.
