%N A374372 Pentagonal numbers that are products of smaller pentagonal numbers.
%C A374372 There are infinitely many terms where the corresponding product has two factors. This can be seen by solving the equation A000326(x)=A000326(y)*A000326(z) for a fixed z for which a solution exists, leading to a generalized Pell equation. For example, z = 5 leads to the solutions (x,y) = (82,14), (1649982,278898), (33266933642,5623138102), ..., corresponding to the terms A000326(82) = 10045, A000326(1649982) = 4083660075495, A000326(33266933642) = 1660033310895213609425, ... in the sequence.
%e A374372 1 is a term because it is a pentagonal number and equals the empty product.
%e A374372 10045 is a term because it is a pentagonal number and equals the product of the pentagonal numbers 35 and 287.
%e A374372 20475 is a term because it is a pentagonal number and equals the product of the pentagonal numbers 5, 35, and 117. (This is the first term that requires more than two factors.)
