%N A374764 Number of integer compositions of n whose leaders of strictly decreasing runs are weakly increasing.
%C A374764 The leaders of strictly decreasing runs in a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal strictly decreasing subsequences and taking the first term of each.
%C A374764 Also the number of ways to choose a strict integer partition of each part of an integer composition of n (A304969) such that the maxima are weakly increasing [but weakly decreasing works too]. The strictly increasing version is A374762.
