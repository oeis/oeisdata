%N A374413 Second center column of elementary triangular automaton rule 210, starting from a lone 1 cell.
%C A374413 An Elementary Triangular Automaton (ETA) is a cellular automaton in the triangular grid where cells hold binary states and rules are local to the first neighborhood. There are 256 possible ETA rules.
%C A374413 Rule 210 (11010010 in binary): "cells with one 1 neighbor change state"
%C A374413 -----------------------------------------------
%C A374413 |state of the cell            |1|1|1|1|0|0|0|0|
%C A374413 |sum of the neighbors' states |3|2|1|0|3|2|1|0|

%C A374413 -----------------------------------------------
%C A374413 The second center column is the sequence of states of the direct neighbors of the initial 1 cell.
