%N A374349 Integers >=0 whose decimal digits are topologically distinct from those of any smaller number.
%C A374349 Assumes 0 without a slash or a center dot, closed 4, 6, and 9, and no overlapping of multiple digits. Digits homologous to a (flattened) sphere: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7; to a torus: 0, 4, 6, 9; to a double torus: 8. Sequence is a run of the terms in ascending numeric order.
%C A374349 All topologically distinct terms can be represented by nondecreasing sequences of strings of 0s, 1s, and 8s.  However, terms cannot begin with 0. Therefore, if a string has 0s, then (i) if there are any 1s, one of them moves to the front, (ii) else, the first 0 is replaced with 4. Sequence is the resulting strings sorted as base-10 numbers. - _Michael S. Branicky_, Jul 11 2024

%e A374349 0 is homologous to 1 torus, so a(1)=0.
%e A374349 1 is homologous to 1 sphere, so a(2)=1.
%e A374349 2 is homologous to 1 sphere, same as 1, so it is not in the sequence.
%e A374349 4 is homologous to 1 torus, same as 0, so it is not in the sequence.
%e A374349 8 is homologous to 1 double torus, so a(3)=8.
%e A374349 10 is homologous to 1 sphere and 1 torus, so a(4)=10.
%e A374349 11 is homologous to 2 spheres, so a(5)=11.
%e A374349 14 is homologous to 1 sphere and 1 torus, same as 10, so it is not in the sequence.
%e A374349 41 is homologous to 1 sphere and 1 torus, same as 10, so it is not in the sequence.
