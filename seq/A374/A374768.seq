%N A374768 Numbers k such that the leaders of weakly increasing runs in the k-th composition in standard order (A066099) are distinct.
%C A374768 First differs from A335467 in having 166, corresponding to the composition (2,3,1,2).
%C A374768 The leaders of weakly increasing runs in a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal weakly increasing subsequences and taking the first term of each.
%C A374768 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.

%e A374768 The 4444th composition in standard order is (4,2,2,1,1,3), with weakly increasing runs ((4),(2,2),(1,1,3)), with leaders (4,2,1), so 4444 is in the sequence.
