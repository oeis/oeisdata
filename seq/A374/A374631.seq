%N A374631 Number of integer compositions of n whose leaders of weakly increasing runs are identical.
%C A374631 The leaders of weakly increasing runs in a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal weakly increasing subsequences and taking the first term of each.

%e A374631 The composition (1,3,1,4,1,2,2,1) has maximal weakly increasing subsequences ((1,3),(1,4),(1,2,2),(1)), with leaders (1,1,1,1), so is counted under a(15).
