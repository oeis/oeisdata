%N A383447 Number of "peerless" trees on n nodes.
%C A383447 A "peerless" tree is an unlabeled, unrooted tree (as in A000055) with the property that if two nodes are joined by an edge then these nodes have different degrees.
%C A383447 _Victor S. Miller_ reports that this sequence was first proposed on Project Euler.
%C A383447 In fact, _Peter J. Taylor_ defined a class of trees for the Project Euler question in order that it wouldn't have any spoilers in OEIS. Frūstrā! - _Peter J. Taylor_, Nov 18 2025
%C A383447 Comment from _Brendan McKay_, May 01 2025 (Start)
%C A383447 The enumeration could be extended by the following argument.
%C A383447 If the tree has a unique centroid (not center!) then removing the centroid gives rooted subtrees of size less than n/2. If there are two centroids, they are adjacent and removing that edge gives two rooted subtrees with exactly n/2 vertices.
%C A383447 Start by making all rooted trees up to n/2 vertices which have no adjacent vertices of the same degree, not counting adjacencies of the root. Then classify them according to which degrees the root can be increased to without violating this condition for edges adjacent to the root.
%C A383447 With this information the counts for n vertices can be reconstructed. In this way getting up past 60 vertices should be possible. (End)
