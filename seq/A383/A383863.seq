%N A383863 The number of divisors d of n having the property that for every prime p dividing n the p-adic valuation of d is either 0 or a unitary divisor of the p-adic valuation of n.
%C A383863 First differs from A073184 at n = 64.
%C A383863 First differs from A383865 at n = 256.
%C A383863 The number of divisors d of n such that each is a unitary divisor of an exponential unitary divisor of n (see A361255).
%C A383863 Analogous to the number of (1+e)-divisors (A049599) as exponential unitary divisors (A361255, A278908) are analogous to exponential divisors (A322791, A049419).
%C A383863 The sum of these divisors is A383864(n).
%C A383863 Also, the number of divisors d of n having the property that for every prime p dividing n the p-adic valuation of d is either 0 or a squarefree divisor of the p-adic valuation of n. The sum of these divisors is A383867(n).
