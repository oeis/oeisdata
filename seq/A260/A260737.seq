%N A260737 Sum of Hamming distances between binary representations of prime factors of n, summed over all nonordered pairs of primes present (with multiplicity) in the prime factorization of n.
%H A260737 Antti Karttunen, <a href="/A260737/b260737.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..10000</a>
%e A260737 For n = 1 the prime factorization is empty, thus there is nothing to sum, so a(1) = 0.
%e A260737 For n = 6 = 2*3, a(6) = 1 because the Hamming distance between 2 and 3 is 1 as 2 = "10" in binary and 3 = "11" in binary.
%e A260737 For n = 10 = 2*5, a(10) = 3 because the Hamming distance between 2 and 5 is 3 as 2 = "10" in binary (extended with a leading zero to make it "010") and 5 = "101" in binary.
%e A260737 For n = 12 = 2*2*3, a(12) = 2 because the Hamming distance between 2 and 3 is 1, and the pair (2,3) occurs twice as one can pick either one of the two 2's present in the prime factorization to be a pair of a single 3. Note that the Hamming distance between 2 and 2 is 0, thus the pair (2,2) of prime divisors does not contribute to the sum.
%e A260737 For n = 36 = 2*2*3*3, a(36) = 4 because the Hamming distance between 2 and 3 is 1, and the prime factor pair (2,3) occurs four times in total. Note that the Hamming distance is zero between 2 and 2 as well as between 3 and 3, thus the pairs (2,2) and (3,3) do not contribute to the sum.
