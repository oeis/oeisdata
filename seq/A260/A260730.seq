%N A260730 Numbers n for which A065339(n) > A260728(n).
%C A260730 Numbers n such that when the exponents in the prime factorization of A097706(n) are added in base-2 they produce at least one carry-bit. In other words, in that set of exponents {e1, e2, ..., en} there is at least one pair e_i, e_j that their binary representations have at least one 1-bit in the same position. (Here i and j are distinct as e_i and e_j are exponents of different primes, although e_i could be equal to e_j. See the examples.)
%C A260730 This differs from A119973 for the first time at n=30 where a(30)=231, term which is not present in A119973. Note that n=231 is the first position where the difference A065339(n) - A260728(n) > 1 as 231 = 3*7*11, a product of three distinct 4k+3 primes, thus A065339(231) = 3, while A260728(231) = 1.

%e A260730 21 = 3^1 * 7^1 is present, because in its prime factors of the form 4k+3 (which are 3 and 7) the exponents 1 and 1 have at least one 1-bit in the same position, thus producing a carry-bit when summed in base-2.
%e A260730 63 = 3^2 * 7^1 is NOT present, because in its prime factors of the form 4k+3 the exponents 2 and 1 ("10" and "1" in binary) do NOT produce a carry-bit when summed in base-2, as those binary representations do not have any 1's in a common position.
%e A260730 189 = 3^3 * 7^1 is present, because in its prime factors of the form 4k+3 the exponents 3 and 1 ("11" and "1" in binary) have at least one 1-bit in the same position, thus producing a carry-bit when summed in base-2.
