%N A260900 Table read by rows: n-th row lists all positive integers k such that exactly half the integers in 1, 2, ..., k are pandigital in base n.
%C A260900 Numbers that are pandigital in base 2 (i.e., numbers whose digits include at least one each of 0 and 1) are 2=10_2, 4=100_2, 5=101_2, 6=110_2, 8=1000_2, etc. (i.e., all positive integers not of the form 2^j-1); exactly 2/2=1 of the first 2 positive integers and exactly 4/2=2 of the first 4 positive integers are base-2 pandigital, so 2 and 4 are in the sequence. For all k > 4, there are more base-2 pandigital numbers in 1..k than base-2 nonpandigital numbers, so there are no more terms in the n=2 row.
%C A260900 In base 3, exactly half of the integers in 1..174 are pandigital, so 174 is in the sequence. Fewer than half of the integers in 1..k are pandigital for all k < 174, and more than half of the integers in 1..k are pandigital for all k > 174, so 174 is the only term in the n=3 row.
%C A260900 The 27-digit number 245836727707164139860503406, which is a(134), is the only term in the n=10 row: in base 10, exactly half of the integers in 1..a(134) are pandigital, fewer than half of the integers in 1..k are pandigital for all k < a(134), and more than half of the integers in 1..k are pandigital for all k > a(134).
%C A260900 For each of rows 2 through 10, the number of terms and a list of those terms (abridged for rows 5 and 6) are as follows:
