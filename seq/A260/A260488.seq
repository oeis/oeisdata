%N A260488 Numbers of the form 2^m * (6k + 1) for m, k >= 0, and 0.
%C A260488 Alternate definition: starting with a(0) = 0, include 2n if n is in the sequence, and include 2n+1 if no two previous terms sum to 2n+1.
%C A260488 It suffices to prove this for odd n. If n == 3(6), n-2 == 1 (mod 6); if n == 5 (mod 6), n-4 == 1 (mod 6). However, if n == 1 (mod 6), any even k in the sequence, 0 < k < n, will have k !== 0 (mod 3), and so n-k != 1 (mod 3), so it is not in the sequence; thus n must be.
%C A260488 Every nonnegative integer is the sum of two members of this sequence; every positive integer is the sum of two distinct members of this sequence. For odd n, this is by the construction in the alternate definition; and for even n, by induction n/2 = i + j, and so n = 2i + 2j.
%C A260488 It follows that:
%C A260488 * No member of this sequence except 0 is a multiple of 3.
%C A260488 * The sequence has a density of 1/3.
%C A260488 * The difference between consecutive terms is always one of {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}, and each of these occurs infinitely often, with 1 having density 1/3 and the others having density 1/6.
%C A260488 * The sequence is closed under multiplication.
%C A260488 * The primes in the sequence are A045375.

%F A260488 n is in the sequence if and only if n = 0 or A000265(n) == 1 (mod 6). [Clarified by _Peter Munn_, Jun 11 2021]
%F A260488 n is in the sequence if n = 0 or b(n) is nonzero where b = A113448, A115235, or A123863. - _Michael Somos_, Jul 29 2015
%e A260488 Using the alternate definition:
%e A260488 1 is in the sequence because it is not the sum of 2 elements from {0}.
%e A260488 2 is in the sequence because 2 = 2*1, and 1 is in the sequence.
%e A260488 3 is not in the sequence because 3 = 1 + 2, and 1 and 2 are in the sequence.
%e A260488 6 is not in the sequence because 6 = 2*3, and 3 is not in the sequence.
