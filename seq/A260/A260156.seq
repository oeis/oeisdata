%N A260156 Number of minimal overlapping permutations starting with 1 of length n.
%C A260156 A permutation is minimal overlapping if the shortest permutation containing two consecutive occurrences of it has length 2n-1. It is also called non-overlapping. A263867(n) is number of minimal overlapping permutations of length n.

%F A260156 The limit of a(n)/(n-1)! is approximately 0.392 (R. Pan and J. Remmel).
