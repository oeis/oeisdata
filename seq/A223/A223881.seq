%C A223881 From _Alexander R. Povolotsky_, Apr 26 2025: (Start)
%C A223881 The scatter plot reveals four distinct, well-separated, monotonically increasing curves. It became possible to extract the integers (all conjectured to be primes) corresponding to each of the four subsets.
%C A223881 Additionally, the approximation formulas for each of the four subsets were derived.
%C A223881 These four approximation formulas, given in the exponential form y=C_k*x^m were found to have a common slope: m=1.197311990 while their displacement coefficients are: C_1≈6.86845, C_2≈3.42058, C_3≈2.28335, C_4≈1.70460.
%C A223881 Notably, these displacement coefficients values exhibit a clear pattern: C_2≈C_1/2, C_3≈C_1/3, C_4≈C_1/4. (For instance, 3.42058≈6.86845/2, and so on.)
%C A223881 Above approximations were derived using general separation and approximation methods and do not specifically account for the fact that these values correspond to the prime numbers.
%C A223881 It appears that all primes in the groups 4, 2 and 1 are generated by the 6*k+1 formula, and so primes in the above groups constitute three subsets of A002476 terms, while all primes in the group 3 are generated by the 2*k+1 formula, and so primes in that group constitute a subset of the terms presented in A000040.
%C A223881 Also it appears that:
%C A223881 1. The first group constitutes a sequence, such that for n>=1, a(n) = A005382(n+6).
%C A223881 2. The third group constitutes a sequence, such that for n>1, a(n) = A158015(n+20).
%C A223881 3. The fourth group constitutes a sequence, such that for n>=1, a(n) = A158016(n+32).
%C A223881 The text files containing the primes, corresponding to the above discussed four groups, where primes are indexed against their position in the complete primes listing (see OEIS's A000040), are viewable and downloadable at the below links section. (End)
