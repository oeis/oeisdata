%N A223733 Positive numbers that are the sum of three nonzero squares with no common factor > 1 in exactly two ways.
%C A223733 These are the increasingly ordered numbers a(n) for which A223730(a(n)) = 2. See also A223731. These are the numbers n with exactly two representation as a primitive sum of three nonzero squares (not taking into account the order of the three terms, and the number to be squared for each term is taken positive).
%C A223733 Conjecture: a(147) = 1885 = 16^2 + 27^2 + 30^2 = 12^2 + 29^2 + 30^2 is the largest element of this sequence. - _Alois P. Heinz_, Apr 06 2013

%F A223733 This sequence lists the increasingly ordered distinct members of the set S2:= {m positive integer | m = a^2 + b^2 + c^2, 0 < a <= b <= c, and there are exactly two different solutions for this m}.
%e A223733 a(1) = 33 because the smallest number n with A223730(n) = 2 is 33. The two representations of 33 are denoted by  [1, 4, 4], and [2, 2, 5].
