%N A146992 Numbers k with the property that there exists a group of order k in which some element of the commutator subgroup G' is not a commutator [x,y].
%C A146992 Every multiple of a(n) is also a term of the sequence because the direct product of a group G with any Abelian group A satisfies (GXA)' = G'.
%e A146992 a(1) = 96 because there is a group G of order 96 in which an element of G' is not a commutator.
