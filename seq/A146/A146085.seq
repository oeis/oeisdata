%N A146085 Positive integers a(n) such that for every integer m == 1 (mod 3), m >= 4, there exists a unique representation of m as a sum of the form a(l) + 3*a(s).
%C A146085 Theorem. An integer is in the sequence iff in its expansion on base 3 all digits at the k-th position from the end, k=3, 5, 7, ..., are zeros while the first digit from the end is 1. To get the decomposition of m==1(mod 3) as sum a(l)+3a(s), write m-3 as Sum b_j 3^j, then a(l) = 1 + Sum_{j odd} b_j 3^j.
%e A146085 If m=46, then we have 46=1*3^0+2*3^2+1*3^3, thus a(l)=1+1*3^3=28 and the required decomposition is: 46=28+3*4, such that a(s)=4. We see that l=4, s=2, i.e. "index coordinates" of 46 are (4, 2). Thus we have a one-to-one map of integers m==1(mod 3), m>=4, to the positive lattice points on the plane.
