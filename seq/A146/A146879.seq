%N A146879 Minimal degree of X_1(n).
%C A146879 a(n) is the least d>0 for which there exists a plane curve f(x,y)=0 of degree d in x or y which is birationally equivalent to the modular curve X_1(n). There exist infinitely many non-isomorphic elliptic curves defined over number fields of degree a(n) which contain a point of order n. a(n)=1 if and only if X_1(n) has genus 0 and these values of n represent the possible finite orders of a point on an elliptic curve over Q.
%C A146879 By Mazur's theorem, these are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 and 12. a(n)=2 if and only if X_1(n) is elliptic or hyperelliptic, which occurs only for n=11,13,14,15,16 and 18 [Mestre 1981]. The lower bound a(17)>3 follows from [Parent 1999] and the upper bound a(17)<=4 appears (for example) in [Reichert 1986]. a(20)=3 since it cannot be 1 or 2 and an explicit example of degree 3 is known (see below).
%C A146879 From [Jeon-Kim-Schweizer 2006] it follows that this is the only case when a(n)=3. The results a(21)=4 and a(22)=4 then follow from explicit examples [Sutherland 2008]. a(24) is either 4 or 5 and a(n) is not 4 for any n other than 17, 21, 22, or 24 by the results of [Jeon-Kim-Park 2006]. a(23) must be 5, 6, or 7. See [Sutherland 2008] for these and other upper bounds for n <= 50.
%C A146879 For n = 23 to 40, a(n) has been computed by M. Derickx and M. van Hoeij. For n = 41 to 100, upper bounds for a(n) have been computed by M. van Hoeij (see link). - _Mark van Hoeij_, Apr 17 2012
