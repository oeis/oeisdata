%N A286749 {0100->null}-transform of the infinite Fibonacci word A003849.
%C A286749 As a word, A003849 = 01001010010010100101001001010010..., and deleting each occurrence of 0100 gives 11001110011001110011010..., in which the positions of 0 are given by A286750, and of 1, by A286751.
%C A286749 From _Michel Dekking_, Aug 29 2020: (Start)
%C A286749 This sequence is a morphic sequence, i.e., the letter-to-letter image of the fixed point of a morphism mu. In fact, one can take the alphabet {1,2,3,4} with the morphism
%C A286749       mu:  1->12341, 2->1, 3->2, 4->34,
%C A286749 and the letter-to-letter map lambda defined by
%C A286749       lambda:  1->1, 2->1, 3->0, 4->0.
%C A286749 Then (a(n)) = lambda(x), where x = 123412... is the unique fixed point of the morphism mu.
%C A286749 How does one see this? We note first that the {0100->null}-transform is equivalent to the {01001->1}-transform, since 000 does not occur in the Fibonacci word xF:=A003849. This indicates that we should look at the return words of the word 01001 in xF.  These are the two words a:=01001 and b:=010. The main result of the Huang and Wen paper is that these two words occur exactly as the Fibonacci word itself.
%C A286749 The situation is somewhat awkward for the word 01001, Huang and Wen call this 'overlapped return words'. To get rid of this overlap nuisance we consider rather the concatenation of the words a=01001 and ba=01001001 in xF over the alphabet {a,b}. Then the {01001->1}-transform maps a to 1, and ba to 1001.
%C A286749 But then we might as well map a to 1 and b to 100. This is what I call a decoration of xF. It is well-known that decorated fixed points are morphic sequences, and there is a 'natural' algorithm to achieve this.
%C A286749 Here this is performed by tripling the letter b, to say, the three letters 234 and coding a by 1. One first writes the induced block-map:
%C A286749       1->12341, 234->1234,
%C A286749 and then turns this into the morphism
%C A286749       1->12341, 2->1, 3->2, 4->34.
%C A286749 The letter-to-letter map is given by lambda:  1->1, 2->1, 3->0, 4->0.
