%N A286263 The smallest weight possible for a prime vector of order n.
%C A286263 A prime vector of order n is an array of n distinct primes P = (p_1, p_2, ..., p_n), such that every sum of an odd number of consecutive elements is also prime. The weight of the prime vector is the sum of its elements. For full details see Kamenetsky's paper.
%C A286263 Calculations by Kamenetsky and J. K. Andersen show that a(15-17) are likely to be 443, 522 and 641.
%C A286263 Calculations by J. K. Andersen show that a(18-21) are likely to be 762, 881, 1002 and 1259.
%C A286263 J. K. Andersen found the best upper bounds for a(22-23) as 1716 and 1931.
%C A286263 For odd n, a(n) <= A068873(n) (smallest prime which is a sum of n distinct primes).
%C A286263 For even n, a(n) <= A071148(n) (sum of the first n odd primes).

%e A286263 The best solution for n=5 is (3,11,5,7,17) with a weight of 43. This is a prime vector because all the generated sums are prime: 3+11+5=19, 11+5+7=23, 5+7+17=29, 3+11+5+7+17=43.
