%N A286291 A bisection of A064736.
%C A286291 The terms of A064736 lie on two (curved) lines; this is one of them.
%C A286291 Sequence is: a(1) = 2, a(2) = 3. m is in the sequence if and only if there is no i such that a(i) * a(i+1) = m, where i are indices of terms in the sequence so far. By definition, this is the complement of A286090. - _David A. Corneth_, May 25 2017
%C A286291 Apparently the same as A121229 shifted by one place. - _R. J. Mathar_, May 25 2017

%e A286291 See comments: 4 is in the sequence, since the terms so far, 2 and 3, don't multiply to 4. Same for 5. Sequence so far is: 2, 3, 4, 5. 6 isn't in the sequence. 7 is. Carrying on we get 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. 12 isn't in the sequence. Further in the sequence, 30 is in the sequence though it's of the form k*(k+1) for k = 5. But 6 isn't in the sequence. And indeed, 5 and 7 are consecutive terms so 5*7 = 35 isn't in the sequence. - _David A. Corneth_, May 25 2017
