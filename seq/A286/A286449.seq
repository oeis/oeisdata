%e A286449 We start by setting a(1) = 1 for A033879(1) = 1. Then, whenever A033879(k) is equal to some A033879(m) with m < k, we set a(k) = a(m). Otherwise (when the value is a new one, not encountered before), we allot for a(k) the least natural number not present among a(1) .. a(k-1).
%e A286449 For n=2, as A033879(2) = 1, which was already present at A033879(1), we set a(2) = a(1) = 1.
%e A286449 For n=3, as A033879(3) = 2, which is a new value not encountered before, we set a(3) = 1 + max(a(1),a(2)) = 2.
%e A286449 For n=4, as A033879(4) = 1, which was already present at n = 2 and n = 1, we set a(4) = a(1) = 1.
%e A286449 For n=5, as A033879(5) = 4, which is a new value not encountered before, we set a(5) = 1 + max(a(1),a(2),a(3),a(4)) = 3.
%e A286449 For n=12, as A033879(12) = -4, which is a new value not encountered before, we set a(12) = 1 + max(a(1),...,a(11)) = 8. Note that the sign matters here; -4 is not equal to +4, which was encountered already at n=5.
