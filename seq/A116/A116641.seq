%C A116641 Related to the parity vectors of Terras and Collatz trajectories.
%C A116641 From _Bob Selcoe_, Sep 14 2019: (Start)
%C A116641 Let R_s be the reduced Collatz sequence starting with s and let R_s(i), i >= 0 be the i-th term in R_s. Then any term in R_s can be described as (3*s^i + k)/2^j, where j is the total number of halving steps from R_s(0) to R_s(i) i >= 1, and k is some term in A116641. k=1 when i=1; when i > 1, k is determined by the specific order of halving steps in R_s.
%C A116641 Ignoring duplicates, terms in A116641 > 1 can be generated by a series of subsequences:
%C A116641 1. Start with subsequence a(m) = 3+2^m, m >= 1; i.e., a(m) = {5,7,11,19,35,67,...}.
%C A116641 2. For fixed m, generate new subsequences b(n) = 3*a(m) + 2^(m+n), n >= 1; so:
%C A116641   m=1, a(1)=5, b(n) = 3*5 + {4,8,16,32,...} = {19,23,31,47,...};
%C A116641   m=2, a(2)=7, b(n) = 3*7 + {8,16,32,64,...} = {29,37,53,85,...};
%C A116641   m=3, a(3)=11, b(n) = 3*11 + {16,32,64,128,...} = {49,65,97,161,...};
%C A116641   etc.
%C A116641 3. Let 2^y be the summand used to find terms (t) in any previously-generated subsequence. (For instance, in m=2, b(3)=53: y=5 because t=53 = 3*7 + 32.) Continue generating new subsequences p(q) = 3*t + 2^(y+z) {z=1..inf} for all t. So in this example, from t=53 we get p(q) = 3*53 + {64,128,256,512,...} = {223,287,415,671,...}; from t=671 we get p(q) = 3*671 + {1024,2048,4096,...} = {3037,4061,6109,...}, etc. (End)
