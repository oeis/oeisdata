%N A116222 Numbers n such that n+(n+1) is prime and sum of the prime factors of n and n+1 is also prime.
%e A116222 83+84 = 167 is prime, 83 is prime, 84 = 2^2*3*7. 83+2+2+3+7 = 97 is prime, hence 83 is a term.
%e A116222 95+96 = 191 is prime. 95 = 5*19; 96 = 2^5*3. 5+19+2+2+2+2+2+3 = 37 is prime, hence 95 is a term.
