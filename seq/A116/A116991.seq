%N A116991 a(1)=1. a(n) = number of this sequence's terms a(m), 1 <= m <= n-1, each with b(a(m),p) not equal to each b(n,p) for every prime p dividing n, where p^b(k,p) is the highest power of the prime p to divide k.

%e A116991 Among the sequence's first 11 terms there are 7 terms that share no common prime-power in their prime-factorization with the prime-powers in the prime-factorization of 12. 12 = 2^2 * 3^1. The 7 terms sharing no prime-power with 12 are 1, 1, 2, 7, 8, 7 and 10. The other 4 terms (3, 4, 3 and 6) each share at least one prime-power with 12 in the integers' prime-factorizations.
