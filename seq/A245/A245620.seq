%N A245620 Number of unitary polyominoes with n cells.  A unitary polyomino is a polyomino whose edges all have length 1.
%C A245620 If a unitary polyomino is colored in checks, all cells on each boundary have the same color.  This characterizes unitary polyominoes.

%e A245620 The monomino (a single square) is unitary.  The domino, trominoes, and tetrominoes are not.  The X pentomino is unitary; the other pentominoes are not.
%Y A245620 Cf. A000105, number of free polyominoes with n cells.
%Y A245620 Cf. A245660, unitary polyominoes without holes.
