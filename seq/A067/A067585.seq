%N A067585 Binary representation of a(n) is obtained thus: replace every digit in the binary representation of n with "1" if the sum of its neighbors is 1 and with "0" otherwise.
%C A067585 The result of one application of the following "game of life" rule to the binary representation of n: ("1" denotes a living cell, "0" a dead cell) A living cell survives, or a dead cell becomes alive, in the next generation iff the sum of its neighbors is 1 (sum = 0 or 2 implies death from isolation or overcrowding, respectively).
%C A067585 For n such that a(n) = n (fixed points) cf. A083713. Iteration of the mapping leads to one of these fixed points.

%e A067585 6 (decimal) = 110 -> 111, hence a(6) = 7; 21 (decimal) = 10101 -> 00000, hence a(21) = 0. Iteration on 13 gives 13 -> 12 -> 14 -> 11 -> 3, or 1101 -> 1100 -> 1110 -> 1011 -> 11 in binary.
