%N A089582 From Gilbreath's conjecture.
%C A089582 Let d_0(n) = p_n, the n-th prime, for n = 1 and let d_k+1 (n) = | d_k(n) - d_k(n+1) | for k = 0, n = 1. A well known conjecture, usually ascribed to Gilbreath but actually due to Proth in the 19th century, says that d_k(1) = 1 for all k >= 1. This sequence gives d_k(2) for all k >1 and for the conjecture to be true, this sequence must contain only 0's and 2's. Although not necessary to the conjecture's validity, the 0's and 2's are of roughly equal count.
%C A089582 The paper cited below by A. M. Odlyzko reports on a computation that verified this conjecture for k = p(10^13) ~ 3 * 10^11. It also discusses the evidence and the heuristics about this conjecture. It is very likely that similar conjectures are also valid for many other integer sequences.
