%N A089066 Number of distinct classes of permutations of length n under reversal, rotation and complement to n+1.
%C A089066 Contribution from _Olivier Gérard_, Jul 31 2016: (Start)
%C A089066 Let us consider two permutations to be equivalent if they can be obtained from each other by reversal (12345->54321), cyclic rotation (12345->23451,34512,45123,51234), n+1-complement (31254->35412), or a combination of those three transformations (they commute with each other). a(n) is the number of classes. It is strictly inferior to (n-1)! for n>1.
%C A089066 If rotation is replaced by addition of a constant modulo n, one obtains the same number of classes but not exactly the same permutations starting n=5. (End)
%C A089066 Original explanation by R. Jerome : Generate all permutations of a string of length n, such as 1234, which has length 4; there are n!=24 of these. Now remove all that have cycles less than 4 characters long; if you only use cyclic notation and not array notation then of the n! possibly only (n-1)! need to be considered. Then calculate the Inverse, Vertical reflection, [VErt reflection inverse], Rotation by 180 degree and [ROt by 180 deg inverse]. If any of these already exist on the list then this permutation is not distinct. Items in []'s are unnecessary since VE(x)=V(I(x))=I(V(x))=R(x) and RO(x)=R(I(x))=I(R(x))=V(x). There are some that are rotationally symmetric and some that are vertically symmetric (only possible for even lengths), but the majority are nonsymmetric.

%e A089066 Examples of permutations (notations of R. Jerome):
%e A089066 Rotationally symmetric: x1=R(x1)=124356=VE(x1), I(x1)=165342=V(x1)=RO(x1)
%e A089066 Vertically symmetric: x2=V(x2)=132645=RO(x2)), I(x2)=154623=R(x2)=VE(x2)
%e A089066 Nonsymmetric: x3=135264, I(x3)=146253, R(x3)=152463=VE(x3), V(x3)=136425=RO(x3)
%e A089066 a(4)=3: there are 3 distinct permutations of exactly length 4, out of a field of 4!=24 possible permutations. In cyclic notation they are designated (1234), (1243) and (1324). The others, (1342), (1423) and (1432), are equal to inverses, vertical mirror images or 180-degree rotations of those 3. The remaining 18 have cycles of length 1, 2 or 3, such as (143)(2) having a permutation of length 3 and a fixed cycle and (14)(23) having 2 permutations of length 2.
