%N A089374 Numbers n such that the concatenation (in descending order) of all the divisors of n, with 1 in the least significant position, is prime (or 1).
%C A089374 See A176558(n) = reverse concatenation of divisors of n. See A175355 for corresponding values of reverse concatenations. Complement of A175354(n) for n >= 2. - _Jaroslav Krizek_, Apr 20 2010
%C A089374 If prime p divides n, then the exponent of p in the prime factorization of n is odd if p == 1 (mod 3) and even if p == 2 (mod 3).  In particular, the sequence has no terms == 2 (mod 3). - _Robert Israel_, Apr 21 2020
