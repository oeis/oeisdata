%N A089755 a(1)=11; for n>1, a(n) is the smallest prime not occurring earlier beginning with a(n-1) without its first digit. Single-digit primes are not allowed unless they arise from the previous term as multi-digit number with leading zero(s) (i.e., a(n-1) has 0 as second digit) which are remembered for the subsequent left-truncations.
%C A089755 Single-digit numbers are not permitted. However, the sequence is calculated allowing leading zeros. See examples. Uniqueness is still determined by the numerical value: 1013, if it appears, cannot be followed by 013 because 13 is already present. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Sep 18 2015
%C A089755 The first digit 2 appears in a(50) = 929 following 109 (since 907, 911, 919 occur earlier), and the first digit 4 appears after a(51) = 29 in a(52) = 941 (because a(39) = 937). The first digit 5 appears in a(199), a 55 digit prime which ends in ...51. The digit 8 appears first in a(230), a 95 digit prime ending in ...81. - _M. F. Hasler_, Sep 18 2015
%C A089755 As noted by _Alois P. Heinz_ in an email, it appears certain that most primes do not occur in this sequence: "Most primes will never show up, because the net length of terms increases with accelerated rate. There are good reasons for that, but I don't have time to write this up now. But see the numerical evidence." In particular, since the density of primes is zero, there comes a point where it is more likely that two (or more) digits need to be added than that a digit can be removed. From that point, the sequence grows at an ever-increasing rate. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Sep 19 2015

%e A089755 After a(1) = 11, the next term must start with 1. 11 is already present, so 13 is next.
%e A089755 After 13, the next term starts with 3, but it cannot be just 3 as that is a single digit.
%e A089755 After 103, dropping the lead digit leaves 03, and 3 has not occurred before, so that is the next term. As sequences in the OEIS are sequences of numbers, not numerals, this appears in the sequence as 3.
%e A089755 The subsequent term will be the next prime having as first digits the preceding 03 with the initial 0 removed (but not the 3 removed). Thus, it must start with 3, and since 3, 31 and 37 have already occurred, it's 307.
