%N A089140 Number of subsequences of {1,2,3,...,n} which are p_1-sequences.
%C A089140 A p_k-sequence {x(i)} is one which is strictly monotone increasing,i.e. x(i+1)>x(i) for i=1,2,3,...,n and satisfies the condition that a(k+1)=f(a(k)), for k=1,2,3,...,n-1, where f is a polynomial of degree k with integer coefficients.

%e A089140 {1,2,5,14} is a p_1-subsequence of {1,2,3,...,14}, since 2=f(1), 5=f(2) and 14=f(5) where f is the first degree polynomial given by f(x)=3x-1.
