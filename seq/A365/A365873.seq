%N A365873 The "triple commas" sequence, a variant of A121805. See the Comments and Example sections for detailed explanations.
%C A365873 The pair of digits adjacent to the comma between two terms forms an integer that is the third of the difference between the said terms. This is the lexicographically earliest sequence with this property. It will stop at some point, but when?
