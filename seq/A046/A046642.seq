%N A046642 Numbers k such that k and number of divisors d(k) are relatively prime.
%C A046642 Numbers k such that tau(k)^phi(k) == 1 (mod k), where tau(k) is the number of divisors of k (A000005) and phi(k) is the Euler phi function (A000010). - _Michel Lagneau_, Nov 20 2012
%C A046642 Density is at least 4/Pi^2 = 0.405... since A056911 is a subsequence, and at most 1/2 since all even numbers in this sequence are squares. The true value seems to be around 0.4504. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Mar 27 2013
%C A046642 They are called anti-tau numbers by Zelinsky (see link) and their density is at least 3/Pi^2 (theorem 57 page 15). - _Michel Marcus_, May 31 2015
%C A046642 From _Amiram Eldar_, Feb 21 2021: (Start)
%C A046642 Spiro (1981) proved that the number of terms of this sequence that are not exceeding x is c * x + O(sqrt(x)*log(x)^3), where 0 < c < 1 is the asymptotic density of this sequence.
%C A046642 The odd numbers whose number of divisors is a power of 2 (the odd terms of A036537) are terms of this sequence. Their asymptotic density is A327839/A076214 = 0.4212451116... which is a better lower bound than 4/Pi^2 for the asymptotic density of this sequence.
%C A046642 A better upper limit than 0.5 can be obtained by considering the subsequence of odd numbers whose 3-adic valuation is not of the form 3*k-1 (i.e., odd numbers without those k with gcd(k, tau(k)) = 3), whose asymptotic density is 6/13 = 0.46153...
%C A046642 The numbers of terms not exceeding 10^k, for k = 1, 2, ..., are 5, 49, 459, 4535, 45145, 450710, 4504999, 45043234, 450411577, 4504050401, ... (End)
