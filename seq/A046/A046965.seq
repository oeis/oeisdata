%N A046965 Cos(a(n)) decreases monotonically to -1.
%C A046965 May be computed found using convergents to the continued fraction for Pi. If cos(a(n)) is near -1, then a(n) is near an odd multiple of Pi. That is, a(n)/(2k+1) is a good rational approximation to Pi with an odd denominator (and continued fractions give good rational approximations).
%C A046965 If a convergent of the continued fraction for Pi has an odd denominator then the corresponding numerator is a term in this sequence. Otherwise add one to the last term in the convergent to get an approximation of Pi with an odd denominator. In this case, we may get a duplicate of the next convergent which we may just ignore.
%C A046965 To illustrate: [3] = 3/1 -> 3; [3,7] = 22/7 -> 22; [3,7,15] = 333/106; 106 is even -> [3,7,16] = 355/113 -> 355; [3,7,15,1] = 355/113 -> 355 (ignore); [3,7,15,1,292] = 103993/33102 -> [3,7,15,1,293] = 104348/33215 -> 104348
