%N A160238 Numbers n such that n^2 can be expressed as the sum of three different nonzero Fibonacci numbers.
%C A160238 There exist a proper subsequence b(i)of a(n): n=[1, 2, 8, 17, 21, 24, 25, 28,29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, ...] such that approximatively b(i+1)=b(i)*(1+phi) where phi is 1.618... is the golden ratio and the approximation holds as a limit when i goes to infinity. For such a subsequence b(i) we have the following formula for the corresponding term when squared b(i)*b(i)=Fib(4*i+1)+Fib(4*i-1)+Fib(3). In the previous example 4999=b(9).
%e A160238 4999*4999=24990001=Fib(37)+Fib(35)+Fib(3)
