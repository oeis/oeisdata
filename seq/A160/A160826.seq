%N A160826 Improvement of A125852 over A053416, A053479 and A053417.
%C A160826 How many more lattice points of a hexagonal lattice can be covered by placing a disk of diameter n at an optimal center instead of one of the three obvious centers (a lattice point, midpoint between two lattice points, barycenter of a fundamental triangle)?
%C A160826 The first difference occurs at n=9, when a diameter 9 disc around e.g. (1/2, 4*sqrt(5)) covers more lattice points than one around (0,0) or (1/2,0) or (1/2,sqrt(3)/6).
%C A160826 Clearly a(n) = O(n) as all "extra" points have norm approximately n^2/4 if the optimal center is chosen near (0,0). Does a(n)/n converge? Are there only finitely many n with a(n)=0?

%F A160826 a(n) = A125852(n) - max(A053416(n),A053479(n),A053417(n))
%e A160826 For diameters n=2,4,6,8 a disc around (0,0) and for n=1,3,5,7 a disc around(1/2,0) happens to be optimal (covers as many points as possible); therefore a(1)=a(2)=...=a(8)=0.
%e A160826 a(9) = A125852(9) - max(A053416(9),A053479(9),A053417(9)) = 77 - max(73,69,76) = 1.
