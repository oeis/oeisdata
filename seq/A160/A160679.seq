%N A160679 Square root of n under Nim (or Conway) multiplication.
%C A160679 Because Conway's field On2 (endowed with Nim-multiplication and [bitwise] Nim-addition) has characteristic 2, the Nim-square function (A006042) is an injective field homomorphism (i.e., the square of a sum is the sum of the squares). Thus the square function is a bijection within any finite additive subgroup of On2 (which is a fancy way to say that an integer and its Nim-square have the same bit length). Therefore the Nim square-root function is also a field homomorphism (the square-root of a Nim-sum is the Nim-sum of the square roots) which can be defined as the inverse permutation of A006042 (as such, it preserves bit-length too).

%F A160679 Letting NIM (= XOR) TIM and RIM denote respectively the sum, product and square root in Conway's Nim-field On2, we see that the bit-length of NIM(x,TIM(x,x)) is less than that of the positive integer x. This remark turns the following relations into an effective recursive definition of a(n) = RIM(n) which uses the fact that RIM is a field homomorphism in On2:
%F A160679 a(0) = 0
%F A160679 a(n) = NIM(n, a(NIM(n, a(n, TIM(n,n)) )
%F A160679 Note: TIM(n,n) = A006042(n)
%F A160679 From _Jianing Song_, Aug 10 2022: (Start)
%F A160679 For 0 <= n <= 2^2^k-1, a(n) = A335162(n, 2^(2^k-1)). This is because {0,1,...,2^2^k-1} together with the nim operations makes a field isomorphic to GF(2^2^k).
%F A160679 Also for n > 0, a(n) = A335162(n, (A212200(n)+1)/2). (End)
%e A160679 a(2) = 3 because TIM(3,3) = 2
%e A160679 More generally, a(x)=y because A006042(y)=x.
