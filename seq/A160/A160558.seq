%N A160558 a(n) is the ordinal number of series in which the value of A160348(n) is defined.
%C A160558 a(n)>=a((f(2n+1)-1)/2), where f is defined as in A159885. E.g., for n=4, we have a(4)=3>a(((9*3+1)/4-1)/2)=a(3)=2.
%e A160558 Put a(0)=0. According to example to A160348, in the first series we find A160348(1) and A160348(2), therefore a(1)=a(2)=1. In the second series we find A160348(3), A160348(5), A160348(6) and A160348(8), thus a(3)=a(5)=a(6)=a(8)=2.
