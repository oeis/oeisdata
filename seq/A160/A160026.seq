%N A160026 Primes p such that p^4 + 17^4 + 3^4 is prime.
%C A160026 For primes p, q, r the sum p^4 + q^4 + r^4 can be prime only if at least one of p, q, r equals 3. This sequence is the special case q = 17, r = 3.
%C A160026 It is conjectured that the sequence is infinite.
%C A160026 There are consecutive primes (1901, 1907) in the sequence.
%e A160026 p = 3: 3^4 + 17^4 + 3^4 = 83683 = 67*1249, so 3 is not in the sequence.
%e A160026 p = 1901: 1901^4 + 17^4 + 3^4 = 13059557751203 is prime, so 1901 is in the sequence.
%e A160026 p = 1907: 1907^4 + 17^4 + 3^4 = 13225216032803 is prime, so 1907 is in the sequence.
