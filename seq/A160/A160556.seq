%N A160556 Positive integers b for which the Diophantine equation f = (b^(2n) - b^n + 8n^2 - 2) / (2n * (2n + 1)) has at least ten solutions for n <= 10000.
%C A160556 For these equations (not exclusively), the sequences of 2n + 1 are dominated by primes.
%C A160556 When b = 2, there are 105 solutions with n less than 10000, and in this case, the sequence of n is also dominated by primes: only five of these are composite. The average difference between successive composite terms is near the magnitude of n. No composite values of 2n + 1 have been found. n and 2n + 1 account for roughly 3% of primes less than 20 billion. For other bases, n is almost always composite, and 2n + 1 is almost always prime.
%C A160556 The next most productive values of b less than 1000 are 509 (41 solutions) and 824 (40 solutions).
%C A160556 Bases that produce a greater or equal number of solutions than smaller bases, except 2, often have ones digit 4 or 9. Values of n associated with composite 2n + 1 are often divisible by 5.
