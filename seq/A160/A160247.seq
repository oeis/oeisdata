%N A160247 Table read by antidiagonals of "less regular type 1" truncated octahedron numbers built from face-centered-cubic sphere packing.
%C A160247 The sequence contains regular cuboctahedra (A005902) on the x-axis, regular octahedra (A005900) on the y-axis, and regular truncated octahedra (A005910) on the diagonal. As for the rest, they each have 6 squares of the same area, while the 8 hexagons (of another same area) have 2 side lengths which alternate.
%C A160247 The x-axis represents an increasing degree of truncation, while the y-axis represents an increasing quantity of units on the remaining original octahedron edge.
