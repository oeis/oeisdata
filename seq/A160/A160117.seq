%N A160117 Number of "ON" cells after n-th stage in simple 2-dimensional cellular automaton (see Comments for precise definition).
%C A160117 Define "peninsula cell" to be the "ON" cell connected to the structure by exactly one of its vertices.
%C A160117 Define "bridge cell" to be the "ON" cell connected to two cells of the structure by exactly consecutive two of its vertices.
%C A160117 On the infinite square grid, we start at stage 0 with all cells in OFF state. At stage 1, we turn ON a single cell, in the central position.
%C A160117 In order to construct this sequence we use the following rules:
%C A160117 - If n is even, we turn "ON" the cells around the cells turned "ON" at the generation n-1.
%C A160117 - If n is odd, we turn "ON" the possible bridge cells and the possible peninsula cells.
%C A160117 - Everything that is already ON remains ON.
%C A160117 A160411, the first differences, gives the number of cells turned "ON" at n-th stage.

%e A160117 At the first generation, only the central "1" is ON, so a(1) = 1. At the second generation, we turn ON eight cells around the central cell, leading to a(2) = a(1)+8 = 9. At the third generation, we turn ON four peninsula cells, so a(3) = a(2)+4 = 13. At the fourth generation, we turn ON the cells around the cells turned ON at the third generation, so a(4) = a(3)+28 = 41. At the 5th generation, we turn ON four peninsula cells and four bridge cells, so a(5) = a(4)+8 = 49.
