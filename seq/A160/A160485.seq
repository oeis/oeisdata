%N A160485 Triangle of the RBS1 polynomial coefficients.
%C A160485 In A160480 we defined the BS1 matrix by BS1[2*m-1,n=1] = 2*beta(2*m) and the recurrence relation BS1 [2*m-1,n] = (2*n-3)/(2*n-2)*(BS1[2*m-1,n-1]- BS1[2*m-3,n-1]/(2*n-3)^2), for positive and negative values of m and n= 1, 2, .. . As usual beta(m) = sum((-1)^k/(1+2*k)^m, k=0..infinity). It is well-known that BS1[1-2*m,n=1] = euler(2*m-2) for m = 1, 2, .., with euler(2*m-2) the Euler numbers A000364. These values together with the recurrence relation lead to BS1[ -1,n] = 1 for n = 1, 2, .. .
%C A160485 We discovered that the n-th term of the row coefficients BS1[1-2*m,n] for m = 1, 2, .., can be generated with the rather simple polynomials RBS1(1-2*m,n). Our discovery was enabled by the recurrence relation for the RBS1(1-2*m,n) polynomials which we derived from the recurrence relation for the BS[2*m-1,n] coefficients and the fact that RBS1(-1,n) = 1.
%C A160485 The RBS1 polynomials and the polynomials defined by sequence A083061 are related by a shift of +-1/2 and scaling by a power of 2 (see arXiv link). - _Richard P. Brent_, Jul 15 2014

%F A160485 The row polynomials RBS1 of the triangle are related to the polynomials Qbar(r,n), r = 0,1,2,..., introduced by Brent by Qbar(r,n) = RBS1(-2*r-1,-n).
%F A160485 Recurrence: Qbar(r+1,n) = (2*n + 1)^2*Qbar(r,n) - 2*n(2*n + 1)*Qbar(r,n-1) with Qbar(0,n) = 1 (Brent, equation 19, p.7).
%F A160485 Qbar(r,n) = binomial(2*n + 2,n + 1)/(2^(2*n + 1)) * Sum_{k = 0..n} binomial(n,k)/binomial(n + k + 1,k)*(2*k + 1)^(2*r); this follows easily from the above recurrence. Two examples are given below.
%F A160485 Qbar(r,n) = 1/4^n * Sum_{k = 0..n} binomial(2*n + 1,n - k)*(2*k + 1)^(2*r) For related polynomial sequences see A036970, A083061 and A245244. (End)

%e A160485 [1, -2]
%e A160485 [1, -8, 12]
%e A160485 [1, -2, 60, -120]
%e A160485 [1, -128, -168, 0, 1680]
%e A160485 The first few RBS1(1-2*m,n) polynomials are:
%e A160485 RBS1(-1,n) = 1
%e A160485 RBS1(-3,n) = 1 - 2*n
%e A160485 RBS1(-5,n) = 1 - 8*n + 12*n^2
%e A160485 RBS1(-7,n) = 1 - 2*n + 60*n^2 - 120*n^3
%e A160485 From _Peter Bala_, Jan 22 2019: (Start)
%e A160485 Qbar(r,n) = binomial(2*n+2,n+1)/(2^(2*n+1)) * Sum_{k = 0..n} binomial(n,k)/binomial(n+k+1,k)*(2*k + 1)^(2*r):
%e A160485 Case r = 2: Qbar(2,n) = binomial(2*n+2,n+1)/2^(2*n+1) * ( 1 + 3^4*n/(n+2) + 5^4*n*(n-1)/((n+2)*(n+3)) + 7^4*n*(n-1)*(n-2)/((n+2)*(n+3)*(n+4)) + ... ) = 12*n^2 + 8*n + 1, valid for n a nonnegative integer (when the series terminates). The identity is also valid for complex n with real part greater than 1 (provided the factor binomial(2*n,n) is replaced with the appropriate expression involving the gamma function).
%e A160485 Case r = 3: Qbar(3,n) = binomial(2*n+2,n+1)/(2^(2*n+1)) * ( 1 + 3^6*n/(n+2) + 5^6*n*(n-1)/((n+2)*(n+3)) + 7^6*n*(n-1)*(n-2)/((n+2)*(n+3)*(n+4)) + ... ) = 120*n^3 + 60*n^2 + 2*n + 1, valid for n a nonnegative integer. The identity is also valid for complex n with real part greater than 2.
%e A160485 Note, the case r = 0 is equivalent to the identity 1 = binomial(2*n,n)/2^(2*n-1) * ( 1 + (n-1)/(n+1) + (n-1)*(n-2)/((n+1)*(n+2)) + (n-1)*(n-2)*(n-3)/((n+1)*(n+2)*(n+3)) + ... ), which is valid for complex n with real part greater than 0. This identity was found by Ramanujan. See Example 6, Chapter 10 in Berndt. (End)
