%N A160440 Smaller member of a pair (p,q) of cousin primes such that p and q are in different centuries.
%C A160440 Sequence is probably infinite.
%C A160440 It appears that every integer occurs as the difference round((a(n+1)-a(n))/100); all numbers 1..298 occur as these differences for a(n) < 1000000000. - _Hartmut F. W. Hoft_, May 18 2017
