%N A098740 Start with the sequence of natural numbers S(0)={1,2,3,...} and define, for i>0, S(i)=D(i)S(i-1), where D(i)A denotes the operation of deleting the a(1+[i/2])th term of A={a(1),a(2),a(3),...}. E.g. D(3){1,2,4,6,9,10,...} means to delete the a(1+[3/2])th = 2nd term of {1,2,4,9,10,...}, giving {1,4,9,10,...}. The given sequence is the limit of S(i) as i->inf.
%C A098740 It appears that the first difference sequence of {a(n)} is A080426.
%e A098740 D(1){1,2,3,4,5,6,...}={2,3,4,5,6,7,...} (delete first term),
%e A098740 D(2){2,3,4,5,6,7,...}={2,3,5,6,7,8,...} (delete 3rd term),
%e A098740 D(3){2,3,5,6,7,8,9,...}={2,3,6,7,8,9,...} (delete 3rd term),
%e A098740 D(4){2,3,6,7,8,9,10,...}={2,3,6,7,8,10,...} (delete 6th term),
