%N A098485 Triangle T(m,k) read by rows, where T(m,k) is the number of ways in which 1 <= k <= m positions can be picked in an m X m square array such that their adjacency graph consists of a single component. Two positions (s,t), (u,v) are considered as adjacent if max(abs(s-u), abs(t-v)) <= 1.
%C A098485 Number of ways to mark the numbers on a square board on a lottery play slip such that one connected graphic pattern is formed. For the lottery "mark 6 numbers of 49 on a 7 X 7 grid of numbers" that is played in many countries, there are T(7,6)=58620 (out of binomial(49,6)=13983816) different combinations of 6 numbers whose graphic pattern on the board forms one connected component.

%e A098485 a(5)=T(3,2)=20 because there are 20 ways to mark two positions in a 3 X 3 square grid such that the two picked positions are either row-wise, column-wise or diagonally adjacent:
