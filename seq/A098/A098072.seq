%N A098072 An example of a 3 X 3 matrix with nonnegative elements that produces the maximum possible number of 10080 different determinants if all 9! permutations of the matrix elements are performed. The target is to find a matrix for which the largest element becomes as small as possible.
%C A098072 In November 2004 this is the example with the smallest known largest element. It was found in a random search after 3 CPU (1.5 GHz Intel Itanium 2) months. No improvement was found in another 6 months of CPU time.
