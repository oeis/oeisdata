%N A357269 Maximum number of stable matchings in the stable marriage problem of order n.
%C A357269 Finding a(n) (denoted f(n) in the literature) is a research problem posed by Knuth in 1976 and reiterated by Gusfield and Irving in 1989.
%C A357269 a(5)=16 was found by Eilers using a MiniZinc constraint satisfaction model, showing previous lower bound of Eilers reported by Thurber to be exact.
%C A357269 A357271 gives lower bounds for a(n) reported by Thurber, previously known to be exact up to n=4, which is not to be confused with A069156 which gives looser lower bounds for n > 11.
%C A357269 Thurber proved a(n) to be strictly increasing.
%C A357269 There are 176130 reduced instances of order 5 with 16 stable matchings, and 498320 reduced instances with 15 stable matchings, compared with A351430 for order 4, and A369597 for order 3.
%C A357269 The total number of reduced instances for order n is A351409(n), which is 214990848000000000 for order 5, so about one in 1.22*10^12 such instances are maximal.
%C A357269 The maximum number of stable matchings for order 5, where the men's (or women's, respectively) ranking table is a latin square, is 14, with 300 such reduced instances, making order 5 the first order not containing any maximal instances where the men's ranking table is a Latin square.
