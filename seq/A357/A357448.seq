%N A357448 Fixed point starting with 0 of the two-block substitution 00->010, 01->010, 10->101, 11->101.
%C A357448 Although iterates of kappa: 00->010, 01->010, 10->101, 11->101 are undefined, we can generate the fixed point (a(n))  by iteration of a map kappa' defined by kappa'(w) = kappa(w) if w has even length, and kappa'(v) = kappa(w) if v = w0 or v = w1 has odd length.
%C A357448 Property: If a word w occurs in (a(n)), then its binary complement  w~ defined  by 0~=1, 1~=0 , also occurs in (a(n)). This is proved by a check for all w of length smaller or equal to 6, and then applying induction based on kappa(w~) = (kappa(w))~.
%C A357448 Conjectures:
%C A357448 (I) (a(n)) is uniformly recurrent, i.e., each word that occurs in (a(n)) occurs infinitely often, with bounded gaps.
%C A357448 (II) The frequencies mu[w] of the words w occurring in (a(n)) exist. Some conjectured values: mu[00] = 1/10, mu[01] = 4/10. Moreover, it appears that mu is invariant for taking binary complements.
