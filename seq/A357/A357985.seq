%N A357985 Counterclockwise square spiral constructed using the integers so that a(n) plus all other numbers currently visible from the current number equals n; start with a(0) = 0.
%C A357985 A number is visible from the current number if, given that it has coordinates (x,y) relative to the current number, the greatest common divisor of |x| and |y| is 1.
%C A357985 The magnitude of the numbers grow surprisingly quickly, e.g., a(150) = -4346232663618226. The only known terms that equal zero are a(0) and a(11); it is unknown whether more exist or if all integers eventually appear.
%e A357985 The spiral begins:

%e A357985 a(6) = 3 as from square 6, at (-1,1) relative to the starting square, the numbers currently visible are 1 (at -1,0), 0 (at 0,0), 1 (at 0,1), and 1 (at 1,0). These four numbers sum to 3, so a(6) = 3 so that 3 + 3 = 6.
%e A357985 a(7) = -1 as from square 7, at (0,-1) relative to the starting square, the numbers currently visible are 3 (at -1,-1), 1 (at -1,0), 2 (at -1,1), 0 (at 0,0), 1 (at 1,1), and 1 (at 1,0). These six numbers sum to 8, so a(7) = -1 so that -1 + 8 = 7.
