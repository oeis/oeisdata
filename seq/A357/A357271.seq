%N A357271 Lower bounds for the maximum number of stable matchings in the stable marriage problem based on composing smaller instances.
%C A357271 a(n) is from Appendix C of Thurber's 2002 paper, using the maximum from each row. At the time of publication, the bounds were known to be exact up to n=4. A357269 shows that they are also exact for n=5. This sequence is not to be confused with A069156, also from Thurber's Appendix C, which uses only the first column, making for looser bounds for n > 11. a(6), a(8), a(10), a(12), and a(16) are also conjectured to be exact.
%C A357271 Improved lower bounds for n=7, 9, 11, 13, 15 are shown in linked Ong et al. (2025) file.
