%N A357775 Numbers k with the property that the symmetric representation of sigma(k) has seven parts.
%F A357775 A237271(a(n)) = 7.
%e A357775 357 is in the sequence because the 357th row of A237593 is [179, 60, 31, 18, 12, 9, 7, 6, 4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 18, 31, 60, 179], and the 356th row of the same triangle is [179, 60, 30, 18, 13, 9, 6, 6, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 6, 6, 9, 13, 18, 30, 60, 179], therefore between both symmetric Dyck paths there are seven parts: [179, 61, 29, 38, 29, 61, 179].
%e A357775 Note that the sum of these parts is 179 + 61 + 29 + 38 + 29 + 61 + 179 = 576, equaling the sum of the divisors of 357: 1 + 3 + 7 + 17 + 21 + 51 + 119 + 357 = 576.
