%N A357409 a(n) is the maximum number of positive numbers in a set of n consecutive positive or negative odd numbers such that the number of pairs that add to a power of 2 is maximal.
%C A357409 For this sequence we check the sums for all possible pairs between two distinct members of a set of consecutive odd numbers, we count as valid results of the form 2^m, valid sums are obviously >= 1.
%C A357409 The related sequence A357574 counts the pairs that add to a power of 2.
%C A357409 For sequences of consecutive odd numbers the maximum number of pairs that add to a power of 2 will never be obtained if the sequence starts with numbers greater than 1. Obviously for sequences of all negative numbers, we will not obtain any valid pair.
%C A357409 It appears likely that an optimal solution for A352178 will contain only odd numbers as a mix of odd and even numbers would lead to two unconnected graphs. Let us now assume A352178(k) has an optimal solution in odd numbers only, then there exists a least m such that a(k+m) uses a superset of the same solution pairs used in A352178(k). It would be interesting to know if m has a bound in relation to k.

%F A357409 Conjecture: a(n) = A274089(n) + 2^t - 1, where t is the number of solutions k > 0 to the inequality n >= 2^(2*(k+1) + 1) - 2^(k+1) - 1. For n < 27, (2^t - 1) is 0, it is 1 for 27 <= n < 119, and it is 3 for 119 <= n < 495.
%e A357409 a(5) = 4 because {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} has four valid pairs: 1+3, 1+7, 3+5, 7+9. But {-1, 1, 3, 5, 7} has only four positive numbers and five valid pairs: 1+3, 1+7, 3+5, 3-1, 5-1, and there is no other set of consecutive numbers with 4 sums being a power of 2.
