%N A357577 Least half area of a convex polygon enclosing a circle with radius n and center (0,0) such that all vertex coordinates are integers.
%C A357577 "Enclosing" means that any edge runs outside the circle or is a tangent.
%C A357577 Such a polygon does not need to be symmetrical, but the partial areas in the four quadrants are equal. Therefore it is sufficient to find the least area of a quarter polygon (multiplied by 2). The half area is an integer because the area of any convex polygon whose vertex coordinates are integers is a multiple of 1/2. The least number of polygons minimizing the area is 16 if x=y is not an axis of symmetry (2 solutions for each quadrant).

%e A357577 For n=1: 2 X 2 square: a(1) = 4/2 = 2.
%e A357577 For n=2: Octagon with vertices (1,2) and (2,1) in the first quadrant: a(2) = 14/2 = 7.
