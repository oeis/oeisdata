%N A357992 a(1)=1,a(2)=2,a(3)=3. Thereafter, if there are prime divisors p of a(n-2) which do not divide a(n-1), a(n) is the least novel multiple of any such p. Otherwise a(n) is the least novel multiple of the squarefree kernel of a(n-2).
%C A357992 In other words, if a(n-2) has k prime divisors p_j; 1 <= j <= k which do not divide a(n-1), where 1 <= k <= omega(a(n-2)), and if m_j*p_j is the least multiple of p_j which is not already a term, then a(n) = Min{m_j*p_j; 1 <= j <= k}. Otherwise, every prime divisor of a(n-2) also divides a(n-1), in which case a(n) is the least multiple of the squarefree kernel of a(n-2) which is not already a term.
%C A357992 Unlike in A064413, a prime p occurrence here is not directly flanked by multiples of p, but by numbers x, y sharing divisors other than p. The terms preceding and following x and y are divisible by p. Typically we observe m*p, x, p, y, r*p, where gcd(x, y) > 1, for multiples m,r of p which do not always follow the (2,3) pattern observed in A064413 and elsewhere. The case of p = 13 is remarkable for being preceded and followed by two multiples of itself (the first five multiples of 13 occur within the span of eight consecutive terms).
%C A357992 Conjecture 1: A permutation of the positive integers with primes in natural order.
%C A357992 Conjecture 2: The primes are the slowest numbers to appear (see also A352187).

%e A357992 With a(2)=2, and a(3)=3, a(4) must be 4, the least unused multiple of 2.
%e A357992 Likewise, with a(3),a(4) = 3,4 a(5) must be the 6, the least unused multiple of 3.
%e A357992 Since every divisor of 4 also divides 6 a(6) = 8, the least unused multiple of 2, (squarefree kernel of 4).
%e A357992 Since a(8),a(9) = 10,12 and 5 is the only prime dividing 10 but not 12, it follows that a(10) = 5.
