%N A357516 Number of snake-like polyominoes in an n X n square that start at the NW corner and end at the SE corner and have the maximum length.
%C A357516 The maximum length is given by A357234(n).
%C A357516 If the lower bounds of A357234(n) are tight, then a(14)-a(19) are 6720, 43232, 14400, 226560, 1646080, 403712.
%C A357516 For n > 1, a(n) is even since for every solution there is also the symmetrical solution reflected in the main diagonal.
