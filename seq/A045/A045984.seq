%N A045984 a(n) = smallest number m such that factorizations of n consecutive integers starting at m have same number of primes (counted with multiplicity).
%C A045984 a(16) > 10^13. a(16) must have at least 5 prime factors (counted with multiplicity) because one of the 16 consecutive numbers is divisible by 2^4. - _Donovan Johnson_, Apr 01 2013
%C A045984 a(16) <= A067820(16) = 361385490681003. - _Martin Fuller_, Nov 23 2025
%e A045984 a(4) = 602 as 602 = 2 * 7 * 43, 603 = 3 * 3 * 67, 604 = 2 * 2 * 151, 605 = 5 * 11 * 11 so four consecutive positive integers have the same number of prime factors starting at 602, the first such number. - _David A. Corneth_, Feb 24 2024
