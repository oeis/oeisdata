%N A045768 Numbers k such that sigma(k) == 2 (mod k).
%C A045768 Equivalently, Chowla function of k is congruent to 1 (mod k).
%C A045768 If p=2^i-3 is prime, then 2^(i-1)*p is a term of the sequence. 650 is in the sequence, but is not of this form.
%C A045768 Terms k from a(2) to a(14) satisfy sigma(k) = 2*k + 2, implying that sigma(k) == 0 (mod k+1). It is not known if this holds in general, for there might be solutions of sigma(k)=3k+2 or 4k+2 or ... (Comments from _Jud McCranie_ and _Dean Hickerson_, updated by _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Sep 25 2021 and by _Max Alekseyev_, May 23 2025).
%C A045768 k | sigma(k) produces the multiperfect numbers (A007691). It is an open question whether k | sigma(k) - 1 iff k is a prime or 1. It is not known if there exist solutions to sigma(k) = 2k+1.
%C A045768 Sequence also gives the nonprime solutions to sigma(k) == 0 (mod k+1), k > 1. - _Benoit Cloitre_, Feb 05 2002
%C A045768 Sequence seems to give nonprime k such that the numerator of the sum of the reciprocals of the divisors of k equals k+1 (nonprime k such that A017665(k)=k+1). - _Benoit Cloitre_, Apr 04 2002
%C A045768 For k > 1, composite numbers k such that A108775(k) = floor(sigma(k)/k) = sigma(k) mod k = A054024(k). Complement of primes (A000040) with respect to A230606. There are no numbers k > 2 such that sigma(x) = k*(x+1) has a solution. - _Jaroslav Krizek_, Dec 05 2013
