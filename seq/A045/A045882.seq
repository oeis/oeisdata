%N A045882 Smallest term of first run of (at least) n consecutive integers which are not squarefree.
%C A045882 Solution for n=10 is same as for n=11.
%C A045882 This sequence is infinite and each term initiates a suitable arithmetic progression with large differences like squares of primorials or other suitable products of primes from prime factors being on power 2 in terms and in chains after. Proof includes solution of linear Diophantine equations and math. induction.

%F A045882 a(n) = 1 + A020754(n+1). - _R. J. Mathar_, Jun 25 2010
%F A045882 Correction from _Jeppe Stig Nielsen_, Mar 05 2022: (Start)
%F A045882 a(n) = 1 + A020754(n+1) for 1 <= n < 11.
%F A045882 a(n) = 1 + A020754(n) for 11 <= n < N where N is unknown.
%F A045882 Possibly a(n) = 1 + A020754(n-d) for some higher n, depending on how many repeated terms the sequence has. (End)
%F A045882 a(n) <= A061742(n) = A002110(n)^2 is the trivial bound obtained from the CRT. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Sep 06 2022
