%N A332956 Symmetrical Zumkeller numbers: numbers s whose divisors can be partitioned into two disjoint sets with equal sum and whose non-divisors less than s can also be partitioned in such a way.
%C A332956 Non-divisors of n are all the positive integers less than or equal to n that are not divisors of n.
%C A332956 Conjecture 1: Except for 6, the perfect numbers (A000396) are in the sequence.
%C A332956 Conjecture 2: At least one out of every twenty consecutive natural numbers is such a number.
%C A332956 Conjecture 3: At least one out of every four consecutive Zumkeller numbers is such a number.
%e A332956 The divisors of 12 are D = {1,2,3,4,6,12} = {1,3,4,6} Union {2,12}. The non-divisors of 12 are N = {5,7,8,9,10,11} = {5,9,11} Union {7,8,10}. Therefore, 12 is in the sequence.
