%N A332069 Numbers whose American English name contains all 5 vowels in alphabetical order.
%C A332069 The name of the number may contain other vowels (A, E, I, O or U) in any place and order. "American English" means that no "and" is used, e.g., 101 = "one hundred one".
%C A332069 Therefore (and because 1000 = "thousAnd" is the least number using the letter "A"), for any term a(n) < 10^4, the number a(n) + x*10^4 is also in the sequence for any x > 0, and so is any number a(n)*10^(6k) + m, m < 10^(6k), k > 0. (The statement isn't true with x*10^3: for example 1084 + 999000 does not have the letter "A".)
%C A332069 In French, 92 ("quAtrE-vIngt dOUze") has the property, and as a consequence the corresponding sequence consists mainly of 92 + x*100 with any x >= 0, and 472 + x*1000 with any x >= 0 ("quAtrE cent soIxante-dOUze"); there is no other term below 4000, from where on others (4012, 4061, 4062, ...) come into play.
%C A332069 In German, the first number to have an 'o' is "Million". Since the 'I' must be preceded by 'A' and 'E', the corresponding sequence would start only after 18*10^6: 18000005, 18000009, 18000015, 18000019, 18000021, 18000022, ...

%e A332069 1084 is "(one) thousAnd EIghty fOUr". This is the smallest number whose English name contains all 5 vowels A, E, I, O, U in this order, therefore a(1) = 1084.
