%N A332822 One part of a 3-way classification of the positive integers. Numbers n for which A048675(n) == 2 (mod 3).
%C A332822 The positive integers are partitioned between A332820, A332821 and this sequence.
%C A332822 For each prime p, the terms include exactly one of p and p^2. The primes alternate between this sequence and A332821. This sequence has the primes with even indexes, those in A031215.
%C A332822 The terms are the even numbers in A332820 halved. The terms are also the numbers m such that 5m is in A332820, and so on for alternate primes: 11, 17, 23 etc. Likewise, the terms are the numbers m such that 3m is in A332821, and so on for alternate primes: 7, 13, 19, 29 etc.
%C A332822 If we take each odd term of this sequence and replace each prime in its factorization by the next smaller prime, we get the same set of numbers as we get from halving the even terms of this sequence, and A332821 consists exactly of those numbers. The numbers that are one third of the terms that are multiples of 3 are in A332820, which consists exactly of those numbers. The numbers that are one fifth of the terms that are multiples of 5 constitute A332821, and for larger primes, an alternating pattern applies as described in the previous paragraph.
%C A332822 The product of any 2 terms of this sequence is in A332821, the product of any 3 terms is in A332820, and the product of a term of A332820 and a term of this sequence is in this sequence. So if a number k is present, k^2 is in A332821, k^3 is in A332820, and k^4 is in this sequence.
%C A332822 If k is an even number, exactly one of {k/2, k, 2k} is in the sequence (cf. A191257 / A067368 / A213258); and generally if k is a multiple of a prime p, exactly one of {k/p, k, k*p} is in the sequence.
