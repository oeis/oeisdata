%N A389815 Number of vertex-transitive graphs with n vertices that are not circulant.
%C A389815 A graph is vertex-transitive if, given any two vertices u and v of G, there is an automorphism that maps u to v.
%C A389815 The circulant graph C_n (a_1,...,a_r) has vertices v_1,...,v_n and all edges v_i-v_j whenever |i-j| = a_k mod n. (It can be rotated onto itself.)
%C A389815 Every vertex-transitive graph is circulant, and these are equivalent when n is prime.
%C A389815 If a graph is vertex-transitive but not circulant, then its complement is also.  Thus a(n) will be even unless n = 4k+1 and n is not prime.

%F A389815 a(n) = A006799(n) - A049287(n).
%F A389815 a(p) = 0 for p prime.
%e A389815 The smallest vertex-transitive graphs that are not circulant are the cube and its complement, so a(8) = 2.
%e A389815 The Paley graph with order 9 is the only example with 9 vertices, so a(9) = 1.
%e A389815 The Petersen graph and its complement are the only examples with 10 vertices, so a(10) = 2.
%e A389815 Any prism graph with n = 4k is vertex-transitive but not circulant, so a(4k) >= 2 for k>1.
