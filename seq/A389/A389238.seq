%N A389238 Odd numbers k whose symmetric representation of sigma, SRS(k), consists of an odd number, >1, of parts and whose center part is the minimum of all parts.
%C A389238 All numbers of the form k = p^(2*m), m >=1 and p odd prime, belong to this sequence; for these numbers k, SRS(k) has maximum width 1, consists of 2*m+1 parts and its center part, having size p^m, is a divisor of k; except for number 4, A001248 is a subsequence of these numbers.
%C A389238 Since every number k in this sequence is odd, the first and last part of SRS(k) have width 1.
%C A389238 Conjecture: The width pattern for any k in this sequence for which SRS(k) consists of three parts is 10101 or 1012101; in addition, these numbers k form sequence A087718(n), n >= 3.
%e A389238 a(1) = 9 is the smallest odd number whose symmetric representation of sigma consists of more than 2 parts and SRS(9) = {5, 3, 5}.
%e A389238 45 is the smallest odd number, whose symmetric representation of sigma consists of at least 3 parts, that does not belong to this sequence since SRS(45) = {23, 32, 23}.
