%N A389227 Numbers in A126706 that are less than the square of their squarefree kernel.
%C A389227 Intersection of S and T, where S is any one of A126706, A059404, A303946, and A332785 and T is either A341646 or A390528.
%C A389227 A126706 is the union of this sequence and A370266, disjoint sets.
%C A389227 Union of disjoint sets A367708 and A364996 = union of disjoint sets A177492 and A370409.
%C A389227 Define sequence R(k) to be the set {m*k : rad(m) | k, m >= 1} for composite squarefree k (i.e., k in A120944). Then S(r) = r * {m : rad(m) | r} and so we have all terms in S(r) that do not exceed r^2 in this sequence. This is to say, given R(k,j) is the j-th term in R(k), that this sequence contains R(k,j) for 1 < j <= A010846(k)-1. As a consequence, this sequence contains no squarefree numbers, therefore occurs in the intersection of A013929 and A024619 = A126706.
%C A389227 The cardinality of the intersection of this sequence and R(k) is A010846(k)-2.

%e A389227 For k = 6, this sequence contains R(k,j) = A033485(j), j > A010846(6), i.e., {12, 18, 24}. Since 6 is the smallest term in A120944, a(1) = 12.
%e A389227 For k = 10, this sequence contains R(k,j) = A033486(j), j > A010846(10), i.e., {20, 40, 50, 80}. Therefore, a(3) = 20 is the first term in this sequence that is not in A033845.
