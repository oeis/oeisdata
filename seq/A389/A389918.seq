%N A389918 Numbers m such that Stern polynomial B(m,x) has no irreducible polynomial factors that themselves are Stern polynomials. The initial a(1) = 1 is included by convention.
%e A389918 Stern polynomial B(481, x) is x^7 + 2*x^6 + 3*x^5 + 5*x^4 + 4*x^3 + 3*x^2 + 2*x + 1, which factorizes as (x^3 + x^2 + 1)(x^4 + x^3 + 2*x^2 + 2*x + 1), and because neither of factors is itself a Stern polynomial, 481 is included in this sequence.
