%N A389918 Numbers m such that Stern polynomial B(m,x) has no irreducible polynomial factors that themselves are Stern polynomials. The initial a(1) = 1 is included by convention.
%C A389918 Some of the products of these terms are also in this sequence, e.g., the following three ones, a(2)*a(39) = 13941785, a(5)*a(64) = 198112319 and a(8)*a(44) = 129569005 are all terms.
%C A389918 Question: Does this have any common terms with A391243?

%e A389918 Stern polynomial B(481, x) is x^7 + 2*x^6 + 3*x^5 + 5*x^4 + 4*x^3 + 3*x^2 + 2*x + 1, which factorizes as (x^3 + x^2 + 1)(x^4 + x^3 + 2*x^2 + 2*x + 1), and because neither of factors is itself a Stern polynomial, 481 is included in this sequence.
