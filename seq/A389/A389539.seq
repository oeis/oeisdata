%N A389539 Maximum number of edges blocked from infinity by n vertices of a hexagonal grid.
%C A389539 Tile the plane with hexagons. The vertices and edges of the hexagons form a grid, in which we can think of the edges as streets, and the vertices as intersections. Place n traffic cones at vertices. A street (edge) is "blocked from infinity" if every path from that edge to infinity must pass through at least one vertex with a cone.
%C A389539 a(n) is the maximum number of such blocked streets over all possible placements of n cones.
%C A389539 For n >= 2, optimal configurations appear to be connected and compact. The sequence shows jumps at n=6 (first complete hexagonal ring, enclosing 1 hex) and n=12 (second ring, enclosing 7 hexes in a "flower" pattern).
%C A389539 Terms n=7 through 12, used a combination of heuristic construction (greedily extending optimal smaller configurations) and exhaustive checking of nearby alternatives.
%H A389539 Conner Silverstein, <a href="/A389539/a389539.png">Solutions for n=2 through n=6</a>
%e A389539 a(2) = 1: Two adjacent cones block the single edge between them.
%e A389539 a(6) = 12: Six cones at vertices of a hexagon block all 12 interior edges.
%e A389539 a(12) = 42: Twelve cones in a "flower" pattern (inner ring of 6 + outer ring of 6) block 42 edges.
%Y A389539 Cf. A002620 (square lattice equivalent).
