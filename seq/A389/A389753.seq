%N A389753 Nonsquarefree numbers that are not perfect powers that exceed the square of their squarefree kernel.
%C A389753 Numbers k > rad(k)^2 that are not perfect powers, where rad = A007947 is the squarefree kernel.
%C A389753 This sequence differs from A389752 since it is missing 144 = 12^2, 324 = 18^2, etc.
%C A389753 Intersection of A303946 and A059172.
%C A389753 Intersection of A303946 and A341645.
%C A389753 Union of A052486 and A366250 = A389752 \ A389864.
%C A389753 Let R(k) = {m*k : rad(m) | k} with squarefree composite k > 1 (k in A120944). This sequence intersects R(k) for m > k such that m*k is not a perfect power, i.e., m*k not in A001597 (or, equivalently, A131605).
%C A389753 If R(k,j) is the j-th smallest term in R(k), then R(k,j) with j <= A010846(k) is not in this sequence. Therefore, s in R(k,j) \ A001597, j > A010846(k) are the terms in this sequence with rad(s) = k. In this manner, this sequence is R(k,j) \ A001597, j > A010846(k), across squarefree composite k.
%C A389753 The number s = R(k, A010846(k)+1) is the smallest term in this sequence with rad(s) = k.

%e A389753 A059404(1) = 12 is not a term since 12 < 36.
%e A389753 For numbers with squarefree kernel 6 (in R(6) = A033845), the smallest number with this quality is R(6,6) = 48 = 2^3 * 3^1 which has more than 1 distinct prime power factor exponent, thus, a(1) = 48.
%e A389753 For numbers with squarefree kernel 10 (in R(10) = A033846), the smallest number with this quality is 160 = 2^4 * 5^1, which has more than 1 distinct prime power factor exponent, thus, a(7) = 160 is the smallest number in this sequence that does not have squarefree kernel 6.
%e A389753 The number 36 = 6^2 is not a term since it is a perfect power and since it is the square of its squarefree kernel.
%e A389753 The number 144 = 12^2 is not a term since it is a perfect power.
