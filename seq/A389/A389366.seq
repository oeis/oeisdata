%e A389366 If Gamma denotes the modular group, and Gamma^n denotes the subgroup consisting of all n-th powers of elements of Gamma, then Gamma, Gamma^2, and Gamma^3 are normal subgroups of indices 1, 2, and 3. If Gamma(n) denotes the principal congruence subgroup of level n, then Gamma(2), Gamma(3), Gamma(4), and Gamma(5) are normal subgroups of indices 6, 12, 24, and 60. The quotient of Gamma by Gamma(5) is isomorphic to the group of rotations of the icosahedron.
