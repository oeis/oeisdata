%N A389625 a(0) = 1; a(n) = (11*n^2 - 9*n + 4)/2 for n>0.
%C A389625 For the purposes of this entry, define a "domino" to be a rectangle with any width w and any height h with a line segment at height h/2 joining the two sides. The rectangle may be tall and thin or wide and squat.
%C A389625 Then it appears that a(n) is the maximum number of regions that the plane can be divided into by drawing n dominoes of any shape, size, position, or orientation.
%C A389625 Two dominoes which have only finitely many points in common can intersect in at most 11 points (see link), and so, by Equation (10) of the pancake-cutting paper, the maximum number of regions possible with n dominoes is (11*n^2-9*n+4)/2 for n>0, and this is attained if and only if every pair of dominoes meets in 11 points. This can be achieved by a construction similar to that in Section 8.3 (see Fig. 19) of the latest version (on my home page at present) of the paper.
%C A389625 As far as I can tell, nothing is lost if we restrict the dominoes to have height equal to twice their width, that is, to have the classical 2 X 1 shape of a domino tile (and slowly increasing widths, as in Section 8.3).
