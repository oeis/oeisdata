%N A389534 Length of shortest loop (in Chebyshev distance) that touches all cells in an n X n grid.
%C A389534 "Loop" means any continuous curve starting and ending at the same point.
%C A389534 "Touch" includes vertices and edges of grid cells.
%C A389534 Equivalent to the Traveling Salesman Problem with unit square neighborhoods and a corner square starting point in an n X n grid.
%C A389534 The problem simplifies to vertex to vertex moves as shown in the StackExchange link.
%C A389534 Ideal loops would be solely made up of (1,1) moves, all of which touch the maximum number of 3 new unit squares. This is impossible in all cases n >= 3 and the following less efficient moves are known to be required:
%C A389534 a(3)..a(oo) contain 2/1 moves.
%C A389534 a(3) contains a 1/1 move.
%C A389534 a(5) contains a 2/sqrt(2) move.
%C A389534 a(7) contains a 4/sqrt(5) move.
%C A389534 Where moves are denoted in the (number of new squares touched)/(unit length) format.
%C A389534 Optimal loops for n >= 2 touch but do not enter the outermost ring of squares, thus the inner vertex of each of the four corner squares are visited in all those cases.

%F A389534 a(n) >= A383980(n) + 2, where n >= 4.
%F A389534 a(n) = A383980(n) + 2, where n >= 6 and n == 0 (mod 6).
%F A389534 a(n) <= 2*n + (n*(n-4))/3, where n == 0 (mod 6).
%F A389534 The linear term is the number of orthogonal moves, the quadratic term is the number of diagonal moves.
%e A389534 a(0)..a(2) = 0. Degenerate cases: Nothing touches all elements of an empty set. A single point may touch all 1 or 4 squares.
%e A389534 a(4) = 8. Both are the shortest loops over the inner vertex of each of the four corner squares.
%e A389534 a(7) = 22 = length of 15 (0,1)s + length of 5 (1,1)s + length of 1 (1,2). A loop where all (0,1) and (1,1) moves are fully efficient is brute-forced impossible. The next best thing is to append a (1,2) move to one of the A383980(7) paths to form a loop.
