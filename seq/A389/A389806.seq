%N A389806 a(n) = A389805(2*n+1).
%C A389806 The number of partitions of T(n) = {-n, ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ..., n} into a set of irreducible balanced subsets. The overall mean value of T(n) is 0. A proper subset of T(n) is called a balanced if its mean value is also 0. A balanced subset is referred to as a reducible balanced subset if it contains a smaller balanced subset, otherwise, it is called an irreducible balanced subset.
%C A389806 Partitions of T(n) into a set of irreducible balanced subsets are called complete.

%e A389806 For n = 3, a(3) = 2, since {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3} has 2 complete partitions: {{0}, {-1, 1}, {-2, 2}, {-3, 3}} and {{0}, {-1, -2, 3}, {1, 2, -3}}.
