%N A389528 Numbers in A024619 that exceed the square of their squarefree kernel.
%C A389528 Numbers k with more than 1 distinct prime factor such that k > rad(k)^2, where rad = A007947.
%C A389528 Numbers k with more than 1 distinct prime factor such that A003557(k) > A007947(k), where A003557(k) = k/rad(k). This is tantamount to numbers k with more than 1 distinct prime factor such that A003557(k) > sqrt(k).
%C A389528 This sequence is { k : A001221(k) > 1, A003557(k) > A007947(k) } = A059172 \ A246549.
%C A389528 Intersection of A126706 and A059172.
%C A389528 Define sequence S(r) to be the set {m*r : rad(m) | r, m >= 1} for composite squarefree r (i.e., r in A120944). Then S(r) = r * {m : rad(m) | r} and so we have all terms in S(r) that exceed r^2 in this sequence. This is to say, given S(r,j) is the j-th term in S(r), that this sequence contains S(r,j) for j > A010846(r). As a consequence, this sequence contains no squarefree numbers, therefore occurs in the intersection of A013929 and A024619 = A126706.
%C A389528 A126706 is the union of this sequence and A370409.

%e A389528 For r = 6, this sequence contains S(r,j) = A033485(j), j > A010846(6), i.e., {48, 54, 72, 96, 108, ...}. Since 6 is the smallest term in A120944, a(1) = 48.
%e A389528 For r = 10, this sequence contains S(r,j) = A033486(j), j > A010846(10), i.e., {160, 200, 250, 320, 400, ...}. Therefore, a(7) = 160 is the first term in this sequence that is not in A033845.
