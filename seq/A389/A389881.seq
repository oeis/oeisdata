%N A389881 a(1) = 3; thereafter, a(n) is the smallest number k that hasn't been used such that gcd(k, n) > gcd(k, a(n-1)), and k != n.
%C A389881 Every natural number excluding 1 appears to be in this sequence.
%C A389881 Starting this sequence with 1, 2, or any other even number immediately terminates the sequence, hence why 3 is the starting term.
%C A389881 It has not been proven that this sequence is finite or infinite, but it can be finite if and only if a(n-1) = K*n, where K is a whole number > 1. If this happens, then a(n) cannot be any number, because the best you can do is gcd(a(n), n) = gcd(a(n), a(n-1)), but gcd(a(n), n) has to be greater, not equal.
%C A389881 a(n) exists for n <= 10^6. - _Michael S. Branicky_, Oct 19 2025
%C A389881 From _Michael De Vlieger_, Oct 20 2025: (Start)
%C A389881 Apart from a(1) = 3 and a(33) = 11, primes seem confined to n == +-2 (mod 12), e.g., a(10) = 5, a(14) = 7, a(22) = 2, etc. Additionally, for prime p, a(n) = 2*p appears to be confined to n that is coprime to 12, apart from a(2) = 4 and a(3) = 6.
%C A389881 Scatterplot shows that the sequence resolves into several major trajectories after about a hundred terms. Aside from some early primes appearing out of order, a prominent trajectory of primes p appears late, while a trajectory of 2*p appears early. Other composites appear in a central trajectory that features some detail "rays" that include a few (but not most) terms of the form m*p for m >= 4.
%C A389881 Let j, k be adjacent terms. Oftentimes j and k are coprime, and a bit less often, j and k share a factor, but each has a factor that does not divide the other. Exceptions include (j,k) = (4,6), (12,18), and generally, many (j,k) pairs where one is a proper prime power. (End)
