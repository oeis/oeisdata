%N A389981 Positive integers (not multiples of 10) whose constant congruence speed is greater than the product of the constant congruence speeds of all their prime factors (see A373387 for the definition of "constant congruence speed").
%C A389981 For the definition of "constant congruence speed", see Def. 1.2 (and also Def. 1.1) of "Number of stable digits of any integer tetration" in Links (for all positive integers m > 1 and not a multiple of 10, this corresponds to A373387(m)).
%C A389981 Here, prime factors are considered with their multiplicity (e.g., the prime factors of 75 are 3, 5, and 5 and thus the product of their constant congruence speeds equals 1*2*2 = 4).
%C A389981 Furthermore, if the product of two positive integers m' and m'' is not divisible by 10, then the constant congruence speed of m'*m'' is necessarily greater than or equal to the minimum of the constant congruence speeds of m' and m'' (see Equation 2.4 of "A Compact Notation for Peculiar Properties Characterizing Integer Tetration" in Links).
%C A389981 By definition, this sequence contains no prime number.

%e A389981 a(1) = 15 since the constant congruence speed of 3 is 1, the constant congruence speed of 5 is 2, the constant congruence speed of 3*5 is 4, and 4 is greater than 1*2.
