%N A389805 The number of partitions of [n] into a set of irreducible balanced subsets.
%C A389805 The mean of [n]={1..n} is (n+1)/2. A proper subset of [n] is called balanced if its mean value is also (n+1)/2. A balanced subset is referred to as a reducible balanced subset if it contains a smaller balanced subset, otherwise, it is called an irreducible balanced subset.
%C A389805 Partitions of [n] into a set of irreducible balanced subsets are called complete.
