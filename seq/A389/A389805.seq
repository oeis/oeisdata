%N A389805 The number of partitions of [n] into a set of irreducible balanced subsets.
%C A389805 The mean of [n]={1..n} is (n+1)/2. A proper subset of [n] is called balanced if its mean value is also (n+1)/2. A balanced subset is referred to as a reducible balanced subset if it contains a smaller balanced subset, otherwise, it is called an irreducible balanced subset.
%C A389805 Partitions of [n] into a set of irreducible balanced subsets are called complete.

%e A389805 For n = 7, a(7) = 2, since [7] has 2 complete partitions: {{4}, {1, 7}, {2, 6}, {3, 5}} and {{4}, {1, 5, 6}, {2, 3, 7}}.
%e A389805 For n = 8, a(8) = 2, since [8] has 2 complete partitions: {{1, 8}, {2, 7}, {3, 6}, {4, 5}} and {{1, 4, 6, 7}, {2, 3, 5, 8}}.
%e A389805 For n = 9, a(9) = 4, since [9] has 4 complete partitions: {{5}, {1, 9}, {2, 8}, {3, 7}, {4, 6}}, {{5}, {3, 7}, {2, 4, 9}, {1, 6, 8}}, {{5}, {1, 9}, {2, 6, 7}, {3, 4, 8}}, and {{5}, {1, 4, 7, 8}, {2, 3, 6, 9}}.
