%N A389230 Even numbers k whose symmetric representation of sigma, SRS(k), consists of an odd number, >1, of parts and whose center part is the minimum of all parts.
%C A389230 All numbers of the form k = 2^s * p^(2*m), s, m >= 1 and p prime satisfying 2^(s+1) < p, belong to this sequence; for these numbers k, SRS(k) has maximum width 1, consists of 2*m+1 parts and its center part has size (2^(s+1) - 1) * p^m; except for 8 and 18, A079704 and A143928 are subsequences of these numbers.
%e A389230 a(1) = 50 is the smallest even number whose symmetric representation of sigma consists of more than two parts and SRS(50) = {39, 15, 39}.
%e A389230 a(2) = 70 is the smallest number whose center part of SRS(70) = {54, 36, 74} divides sigma(70) = 144 = 4*36.
%e A389230 a(51) = 1014 = 2*3*13^2 is the smallest number in the sequence for which its first part of the symmetric representation of sigma has maximum width larger than 1; its width pattern is 1 2 1 0 1 2 1 0 1 2 1.
%e A389230 3850 is the smallest even number whose symmetric representation of sigma consists of at least 3 parts that does not belong to the sequence since SRS(3850) = {2889, 3150, 2889}.
