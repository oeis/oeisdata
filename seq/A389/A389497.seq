%N A389497 Numbers whose number of powerful divisors is a square.
%C A389497 First differs from A336224 at n = 146: a(146) = 216 is not a term in A336224. Also, A336224(173) = 256 is the least term in A336224 that is not in this sequence.
%C A389497 Subsequence of A389499 and first differs from it at n = 97: A389499(97) = 144 is not a term in this sequence.
%C A389497 Numbers k for which the product of their prime factorization exponents, A005361(k), is a square.
%C A389497 If k and m are coprime terms, then k*m is also a term.
%C A389497 In particular, if k is a term, and m is a squarefree number coprime to k, then k*m is also a term. The primitive terms in this sequence (A389498) are the powerful (A001694) terms.
%C A389497 The asymptotic density of this sequence is Sum_{n>=1} f(A389498(n)) = 0.66618313..., where f(n) = (6/(Pi^2*n)) * Product_{prime p|n} (p/(p+1)).
