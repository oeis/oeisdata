%N A389940 Numbers k for which a sphere of radius k is a member of at least 1 set of 4 spheres of coprime positive integer radii which are tangent to a plane when arranged as mutually tangent to one another.
%C A389940 Unique values of A390148.
%C A389940 It is observed that most terms occur in multiple examples, e.g., 3 is a member of {1, 3, 3, 3}, {3, 3, 7, 21}, and {3, 4, 12, 12}. The first few that do not are 1: {1, 3, 3, 3}, 4: {3, 4, 12, 12}, and 36: {28, 36, 63, 252}.
%C A389940 It is unknown if specific terms can otherwise be found algorithmically, though it is conjectured that the general increase in gap size between successive terms as n increases continues to infinity.
%e A389940 3, 4, and 12 are all in the sequence because spheres of radius 3, 4, 12, and 12 are tangent to a plane when arranged as mutually tangent to one another.
%Y A389940 Cf. A390148.
