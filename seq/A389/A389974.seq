%N A389974 A generalization of Euclid-Mullin sequence A000945 applied to generate only primes of the form 4k+3: let Q be the product of all preceding terms, then a(n) is the smallest prime factor of the form 4k+3 of whichever of {Q+2, Q+4} has the form 4k+3.
%C A389974 The definition ensures all terms are distinct. Like Euclid-Mullin sequence A000945, this definition is based on a straightforward way of demonstrating that a set of primes is infinite.
%C A389974 The general method here is to calculate the product Q of the preceding terms, determine the next larger number N = Q+j of the same form as that required for the sequence terms (with j coprime to all numbers of the required form), then determine N's least prime factor of that form.
%C A389974 This simple method works also for primes of the form 2k+1 (giving A125045), 3k+2 and 6k+5, but not for primes of the form m*k+1 for m > 2 (as some members of such residue classes do not have a prime factor with the same residue modulo m). But the method can be suitably adjusted with only a small loss of simplicity: see, for example, A057207, which generates primes of the form 4k+1.
%C A389974 As is the case for A000945, probabilistic analysis might be seen to support an expectation that all primes of the specified form appear in the sequence.

%F A389974 a(n) = min({p prime : p|Q and p has form 4k+3}), where Q = (Product_{k=1..(n-1)} a(k)) + 2*(2 - (n mod 2)).
%e A389974 For n=1: there are no preceding terms, so the product of these terms is Q = 1 (the empty product); Q + 2 = 3 has the form 4k+3 (k = 0); the least prime factor of 3 that has the form 4k+3 is obviously its only prime factor, 3; so a(1) = 3.
%e A389974 For n=6: the product of the preceding 5 terms is Q = 3 * 7 * 23 * 487 * 71 = 16700691;  N = Q + 4 = 16700695 has the form 4k+3 and the prime factorization of N is 5 * 11 * 303649; 5 has the form 4k+1, so the least prime factor of N that has the form 4k+3 is 11 = 4*2+3; so a(6) = 11.
