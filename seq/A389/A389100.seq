%N A389100 Elements of a non-singleton interval of natural numbers whose product is divisible by the square of the largest prime factor of the product.
%C A389100 All terms are composite.
%C A389100 The square of an odd prime and its predecessor are terms.
%C A389100 Conjecture: A387054 is a subsequence.
%C A389100 The conjecture above follows easily from the definitions: k is in A387054 if it is in A388654 but not in A070003. The former condition means that k is in an interval of numbers whose product is divisible by the square of the largest prime factor of the product, and the latter means that that interval cannot consist of k only. So k is a term here. - _Pontus von Brömssen_, Sep 26 2025
