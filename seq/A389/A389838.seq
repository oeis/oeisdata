%N A389838 Numbers of the form j*k or j*k + (j-1)*(k-1) with j, k > 1.
%C A389838 Numbers of stars which can be arranged on a flag so as either to completely fill a rectangle (j*k stars), or where one additional star is put in each unit square (j*k + (j-1)*(k-1) stars).

%e A389838 a(1) = 4 stars on the corners of the unit square.
%e A389838 a(2) = 5 stars after putting an additional star in the center of that unit square.
