%N A389752 Numbers in A059404 that exceed the square of their squarefree kernel.
%C A389752 Numbers k > rad(k)^2 such that prime power factor p^m | k has more than one distinct m, where rad = A007947 is the squarefree kernel.
%C A389752 Intersection of A059404 and A059172.
%C A389752 Intersection of A059404 and A341645.
%C A389752 Union of the following disjoint subsets: A359280 and A366250, A389753 and A389864.
%C A389752 A389528 is the union of this sequence and A388304, disjoint sets.
%C A389752 A370266 is the union of this sequence and A303606, disjoint sets.
%C A389752 A059404 is the union of this sequence and A389227, disjoint sets.
%C A389752 A126706 is the union of this sequence, A389227, and A303606, disjoint sets.
%C A389752 Let R(k) = {m*k : rad(m) | k} with squarefree composite k > 1 (k in A120944). This sequence intersects R(k) for m > k such that m*k is not a perfect power of k, i.e., m*k not in A303606.
%C A389752 If R(k,j) is the j-th smallest term in R(k), then R(k,j) with j <= A010846(k) is not in this sequence. Therefore, s in R(k,j) \ A303606, j > A010846(k) are the terms in this sequence with rad(s) = k. In this manner, this sequence is the local complement of powers {k^m : m > 0} with respect to R(k,j), j > A010846(k), across squarefree composite k.
%C A389752 The number s = R(k, A010846(k)+1) is the smallest term in this sequence with rad(s) = k.

%e A389752 A059404(1) = 12 is not a term since 12 < 36.
%e A389752 For numbers with squarefree kernel 6 (in R(6) = A033845), the smallest number with this quality is R(6,6) = 48 = 2^3 * 3^1 which has more than 1 distinct prime power factor exponent, thus, a(1) = 48.
%e A389752 For numbers with squarefree kernel 10 (in R(10) = A033846), the smallest number with this quality is 160 = 2^4 * 5^1, which has more than 1 distinct prime power factor exponent, thus, a(7) = 160 is the smallest number in this sequence that does not have squarefree kernel 6.
%e A389752 The number 36 = 6^2 = 2^2 * 3^2 is not a term since it is the square of a squarefree number and thus its prime power factor exponents are the same. Furthermore, 36 = rad(36)^2.
%e A389752 The number 1000 = 10^3 = 2^3 * 5^3 is not a term since it is the square of a squarefree number and thus its prime power factor exponents are the same.
