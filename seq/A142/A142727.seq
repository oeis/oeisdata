%N A142727 For definition see Comments lines.
%C A142727 S is a sequence of numbers with repetitions, sorted in nondecreasing order.
%C A142727 Initially a(1) = 1 and S = N = {1,2,3,4,5,6,...}.
%C A142727 For each n >= 2, let p = prime(n), let a(n) = (p-1)st term of S and set S = S union a(n)*N. Repeat.
%C A142727 A sequence arising from one possible attempt to analyze A141586.
%C A142727 A plot of the extended sequence suggests that a(n) ~= c n log(log(n)) + d n for constants c and d. For example, run: $ gnuplot> plot [] [1.27:1.35] a142727.txt using 1:4, 1.12+0.076*log(log(x)).

%e A142727 The first few stages in the calculation are as follows:
%e A142727 S = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 ...
%e A142727 n = 2, p = 3, so a(2) is the 2nd term of S, which is 2.
%e A142727 Now S = 1 2 2 3 4 4 5 6 6 7 8 8 9 10 10 11 12 12 13 14 14 ...
%e A142727 n = 3, p = 5, so a(3) is the 4th term of S, which is 3.
%e A142727 Now S = 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 6 6 6 7 8 8 9 9 10 10 11 12 12 12 13 14 14 ...
%e A142727 n = 4, p = 7, so a(4) is the 6th term of S, which is 4.
%e A142727 Now S = 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 4 5 6 6 6 7 8 8 8 9 9 10 10 11 12 12 12 12 13 14 14 ...
%e A142727 n = 5, p = 11, so a(5) is the 10th term of S, which is 6.
%e A142727 And so on.
