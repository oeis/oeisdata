%N A109291 New factors appearing in the factorization of 5^k - 2^k as k increases.
%C A109291 Zsigmondy numbers for a = 5, b = 2: Zs(n, 5, 2) is the greatest divisor of 5^k - 2^k that is relatively prime to 5^j - 2^j for all positive integers j < k.

%e A109291 a(1) = 3 because 5^1 - 2^1 = 3.
%e A109291 a(2) = 7 because, although 5^2 - 2^2 = 21 = 3 * 7 has prime factor 3, that has already appeared in this sequence, but the factor of 7 is new.
%e A109291 a(3) = 13 because, although 5^3 - 2^3 = 117 = 3^2 * 13 has repeated prime factor 3, that has already appeared in this sequence, but the prime factor of 13 is new.
%e A109291 a(4) = 29 because, although 5^4 - 2^4 = 2385 = 609 = 3 * 7 * 29, the prime factors of 3 and 7 have already appeared in this sequence, but the prime factor of 29 is new.
%e A109291 a(5) = 1031 because, although 5^5 - 2^5 = 16775 = 3093 = 3 * 1031, the prime factor of 3 has already appeared in this sequence, but the prime factors of 1031 is new.
