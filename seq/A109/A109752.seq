%N A109752 Using the lunar product (see A087062 for definition), numbers n such that if n divides a*b, then n must divide either a or b. The multiplicative identity, 9, is excluded by convention.
%C A109752 This condition is one of the definitions of a prime, so these numbers could be called lunar primes (cf. A087097).

%e A109752 90 is a member because the lunar multiples of 90 are the same as the numbers ending with a 0 and if neither a nor b ends in 0, then neither does a*b.
%Y A109752 Cf. A087062, A087097.
