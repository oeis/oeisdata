%N A109023 3-almost primes (A014612) whose digit reversal is different and also has 3 prime factors (with multiplicity). "Emirp Tsomla-3.".
%C A109023 This sequence is the k = 3 instance of the series which begins with k = 1 (emirps), k = 2 (emirpimes). Forthcoming paper on this sequence: "Jonathan Vos Post, "1066 and All That: Emirp Tsomla-3 and Related Integer Sequences."
%C A109023 The Mathematica code for this was written by Ray Chandler who extended this sequence. He also has more values.

%e A109023 1066 is in this sequence because 1066 = 2 * 13 * 41, making it a 3-almost prime and reverse(1066) = 6601 = 7 * 23 * 41, also a 3-almost prime.
%e A109023 2001 is in this sequence because 2001 = 3 * 23 * 29 and reverse(2001) = 1002 = 2 * 3 * 167.
