%N A109377 Expansion of ( 2+x+2*x^2 ) / ( 1-2*x+x^2-x^3 ).
%C A109377 Previous name was: A coin is tossed n times and the resultant strings of H's and T's are arranged in a circular (cyclic) manner (i.e. the outcome of the n-th toss is chained to the outcome of the first toss). Then the above sequence represents the number of strings, out of total possible strings of n tosses (n>1), having no isolated H, (by an isolated H, we mean single 'H' which is preceded and succeeded by a 'T'), when the resultant strings are arranged and studied in circular manner. Illustration: In the following string of 10 tosses, 'HHTHTHTTTH', there are only 2 isolated H's, namely the H's at toss number 4 and 6. whereas in the string 'THTHTHTTTH', there will be 4 isolated H's, namely at toss number 2,4,6 and 10. In the string 'HHTTHHHTTH' there is no isolated H, as the H at the 10th toss when chained to the first toss, will no longer be the isolated H, but a triple H.

%F A109377 If a(k) denotes the k-th term( k>4), of the above sequence then a(k)=2a(k-1)-a(k-2)+a(k-3), with a(2)=2, a(3)=5, a(4)=10. Also the k-th term, a(k)( k>5), of this sequence, can be obtained by the formula, a(k)=a(k-1)+a(k-2)+a(k-4), (previous 4 terms are needed), where a(2)=2, a(3)=5, a(4)=10, a(5)=17.
%F A109377 a(n) = P(2*n + 4) where P is the Perrin sequence (A001608). a(n) is asymptotic to r^(n+2) where r is the real root of x^3 -2*x^2 +x -1 (A109134). For n>2, a(n) = round(r^(n+2)). - _Gerald McGarvey_, Jan 12 2008
