%N A109844 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, next terms up to a(2n-1) are obtained by multiplying previous terms a(n-1) by n+1, a(n-2) by n+2 etc. a(2) by (2n-2) and a(1) by 2n-1. On similar lines a(2n) = 2n*a(2n-2), a(2n+1) = (2n+1)*a(2n-1) and so on.
%C A109844 Might be called a self-dependent or bootstrap sequences. a(n) is a multiple of n by definition. Subsidiary sequences: (i) next n-1 numbers are n times the previous n-1 terms and many more such sequences by variations in coefficients. (ii) a(n) = A109844(n)/n.
%e A109844 a(9) = 9.
%e A109844 a(10) = 10*a(8) = 10*16 = 160.
%e A109844 a(11) = 11*21 = 231.
