%N A109254 New factors appearing in the factorization of 7^k - 2^k as k increases.
%C A109254 Zsigmondy numbers for a = 7, b = 2: Zs(n, 7, 2) is the greatest divisor of 7^k - 2^k that is relatively prime to 7^j - 2^j for all positive integers j < k.

%e A109254 a(1) = 5 because 7^1 - 2^1 = 5.
%e A109254 a(2) = 3 because, although 7^2 - 2^2 = 45 = 3^2 * 5 has prime factor 5, that has already appeared in this sequence, but the repeated prime factor of 3 is new.
%e A109254 a(3) = 67 because, although 7^3 - 2^3 = 335 = 5 * 67 has prime factor 5, that has already appeared in this sequence, but the prime factor of 67 is new.
%e A109254 a(4) = 53 because, although 7^4 - 2^4 = 2385 = 3^2 * 5 * 53, the prime factors of 3 and 5 have already appeared in this sequence, but the prime factor of 53 is new.
