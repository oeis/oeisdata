%N A109037 Number of irreducible partitions into triangular numbers. A partition is irreducible if no subpartition with 2 or more parts sums to a triangular number.
%C A109037 Sequence is almost certainly unbounded. Obviously it contains infinitely many 1's, at triangular indices. At non-triangular indices, series appears to go to infinity, but this is conjecture and growth rate is entirely unknown. Also unknown is whether the sequence is onto the positive integers.
%e A109037 a(9)=1 for the partition [6,3]. [6,1^3], [3^3], [3^2,1^3], [3,1^6] and [1^9] are all excluded because they contain subpartitions [3^2] or [1^3] summing to a triangular number.
