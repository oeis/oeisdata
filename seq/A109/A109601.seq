%N A109601 A puzzle sequence: you are asked to find the next three terms. I know nothing more about it.
%C A109601 William Maness, Oct 24 2011, observes that so far the terms are all odd numbers and the numbers of digits is alternately 2 and 3. Sequence is likely from a book of math puzzles for grade school.
%C A109601 The answer to the puzzle could be 209, 28, 343. The sequence can be bisected into a 2-digit sequence b = {87, 43, 65, 39, 17, b(6)} and a 3-digit sequence c = {711, 269, 555, 421, c(5), c(6)}. Note that the first 3 terms in sequence b satisfy: b(1) - b(3) = b(3) - b(2) = 22. Assuming that the last 3 terms follow the similar pattern, b(4) - b(6) = b(6) - b(5) = x, we have b(6) = 28 and x = 11 = 22/2. In sequence c, c(1) - c(3) = 156 and c(3) - c(2) = 286 = 156 + 2*b(3). Similarly, c(4) - c(6) = 156/2 and c(6) - c(5) = 156/2 + 2*b(6), which means c(6) = c(4) - 156/2 = 343 and c(5) = 209. - _Ya-Ping Lu_, Oct 21 2025
