%N A242912 Finite sequence where each term follows n*10^n + p, where p is an n-digit prime and 1 <= n <= 9.
%C A242912 The sequence is finite because only the first digit is considered in defining the entire number. This first digit can vary only between 1 and 9. Hence, the largest possible number must be 9000000000 + p, where p is a 9-digit prime number. The largest prime I have found that fits this category is 999999937, giving the term, 9999999937.
%e A242912 For n = 2, 2*10^2 + 19 = 219. 19 is a 2-digit prime.
%e A242912 Note that for each n, several a(i) are generated, and the first of these is related to the 1st prime with n-digits. For n=1, the first term we get is related to the 1st prime with 1 digit, and there 4 of them. For n=2, the first term we get is related to the 1st prime with 2 digits and there 21 of them, etc.
