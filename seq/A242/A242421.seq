%N A242421 Fixed points of A153212: After a(1) = 1, numbers of the form p_i1^i1 * p_i2^(i2-i1) * p_i3^(i3-i2) * ... * p_ik^(ik-i_{k-1}), where p_i's are distinct primes present in the prime factorization of n, with i1 < i2 < i3 < ... < ik, and k = A001221(n) and ik = A061395(n).
%C A242421 This sequence is closed with respect to A122111, i.e., for any n, A122111(a(n)) is either the same as a(n) or some other term a(k) of the sequence.
%C A242421 These numbers encode partitions in whose Young diagrams all pairs of successive horizontal and vertical segments (those pairs sharing "a common convex corner") are of equal length. Cf. the example-illustration at A153212.
%C A242421 Note: The seventh primorial, 510510 (= A002110(7)) occurs here as a term a(62).
%e A242421 2 = p_1^1 is present, as the first prime index delta and exponent are equal.
%e A242421 3 = p_2^1 is not present, as 1 <> 2.
%e A242421 6 = p_1^1 * p_2^(2-1) is present.
%e A242421 9 = p_2^2 is present, as 2 = 2.
%e A242421 30 = p_1^1 * p_2^(2-1) * p_3^(3-2) is present, as all primorials are.
%e A242421 50 = p_1^1 * p_3^(3-1) is present also.
