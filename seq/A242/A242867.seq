%N A242867 Discriminants of cubic domains for cubefree n.
%C A242867 The table in Alaca & Williams (2004) skips over n = 4, 9, 16 but includes 12, 18 and 20; then there is a footnote to the table explaining that Q(4^(1/3)) and Q(16^(1/3)) work out to be subdomains of Q(2^(1/3)), and similarly for Q(9^(1/3)) and Q(3^(1/3)) and for Q(18^(1/3)) and Q(12^(1/3)).
%D A242867 Şaban Alaca & Kenneth S. Williams, Introductory Algebraic Number Theory. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (2004): 176-177, Theorem 7.3.2 on the former page, Table 1 on the latter page.
%F A242867 Set m = A004709(n), then express it as m = h * k^2, where k = A000188(m), the square root of the largest square dividing m, and h = m/k^2 = A007913(m). Then:
%F A242867 a(n) = -3h^2 * k^2 if m == +-1 (mod 9), otherwise a(n) = -27h^2 * k^2.
%F A242867 This formula is from Theorem 7.3.2 in Alaca & Williams (2004).
%e A242867 a(7) = -1323 because the seventh cubefree number is 7 and Q(7^(1/3)) has -1323 for a discriminant.
%e A242867 a(8) = -243 because the eighth cubefree number is 9 and Q(9^(1/3)) is a subdomain of Q(3^(1/3)), which has a discriminant of -243.
