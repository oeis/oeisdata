%N A242424 Bulgarian solitaire operation on partition list A112798: a(1) = 1, a(n) = A000040(A001222(n)) * A064989(n).
%C A242424 In "Bulgarian solitaire" a deck of cards or another finite set of objects is divided into one or more piles, and the "Bulgarian operation" is performed by taking one card from each pile, and making a new pile of them, which is added to the remaining set of piles. Essentially, this operation is a function whose domain and range are unordered integer partitions (cf. A000041) and which preserves the total size of a partition (the sum of its parts). This sequence is induced when the operation is implemented on the partitions as ordered by the list A112798.
%C A242424 Please compare to the definition of A122111, which conjugates the partitions encoded with the same system.
%C A242424 a(n) is even if and only if n is either a prime or a multiple of three.
%C A242424 Conversely, a(n) is odd if and only if n is a nonprime not divisible by three.
