%N A242927 a(n) = smallest k such that k^m + (k+1)^m + ... + (k+m-1)^m is prime, where m = A014117(n).
%C A242927 Original title: "Numbers m such that k^m + (k+1)^m + ... + (k+m-1)^m is prime for some k." That sequence is a duplicate of A014117 as first noticed by _M. F. Hasler_. Indeed, Faulhaber's formula implies that m divides k^m + (k+1)^m + ... + (k+m-1)^m for any k, unless m divides the denominator of Bernoulli number B_m. Hence, the old sequence is a subsequence of A014117, while the discovered primes prove that the two sequences coincide. The current sequence lists the smallest values of k instead. - _Max Alekseyev_, Nov 04 2025
%e A242927 For n = 1, m = A014117(1) = 1 and the sum is k^1 = k, which is prime for smallest k = 2 = a(1) or any other prime (cf. A000040).
%e A242927 For n = 2, m = A014117(2) = 2 and the sum is k^2 + (k+1)^2, which is prime for smallest k = 1 = a(2).
%e A242927 a(5) = 3081 with m = 1806 yields a strong PRP with 6663 digits. - _Don Reble_, Mar 23 2018
