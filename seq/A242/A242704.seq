%N A242704 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive integers such that for any n>0 the number of ones in the binary representation of a(n) divides a(n+1).
%C A242704 Is this a permutation of the positive integers ?
%C A242704 It seems that for a(n-1) = 2^m, a(n) = prime(m), since m < A000120(2^m) = 1, and since p = prime(m) is the smallest missing number for n > 1 as p > m. - _Michael De Vlieger_, Feb 03 2026

%e A242704 From _Michael De Vlieger_, Feb 03 2026: (Start)
%e A242704 Let wt(k) = A000120(k), the number of 1's in the binary expansion of k.
%e A242704 Let u(k) be the smallest missing number in this sequence a(1..k).
%e A242704 a(1) = u(1) = 1 since it is the smallest nonzero positive number; u(2) = 2.
%e A242704 a(2) = u(2) = 2 since wt(a(1)) = 1, and 1 | 2.
%e A242704 a(3) = u(3) = 3 since wt(a(2)) = 1, and 1 | 3.
%e A242704 a(4) = u(4) = 4 since wt(a(3)) = 2, and 2 | 4.
%e A242704 a(5) = u(5) = 5 since wt(a(4)) = 1, and 1 | 5.
%e A242704 a(6) = u(6) = 6 since wt(a(5)) = 2, and 2 | 6.
%e A242704 a(7) = 8 since wt(a(6)) = 2, but 2 does not divide u(7) = 7, though 2 | 8, and u(8) remains 7.
%e A242704 a(8) = u(8) = 7 since wt(a(7)) = 1, and 1 | 7.
%e A242704 a(9) = u(9) = 9 since wt(a(8)) = 3, and 3 | 9.
%e A242704 a(10) = u(10) = 10 since wt(a(9)) = 2, and 2 | 10.
%e A242704 a(11) = 12, since wt(a(10)) = 2, but 2 does not divide u(11) = 11, though 2 | 12.
%e A242704 a(12) = 14, since wt(a(11)) = 2; 2 does not divide u(12) = 11, or 13, but 2 | 14, etc. (End)
