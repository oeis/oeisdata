%N A242615 a(n) = exp( (log P(n))^2 - log(n!) ), multiplied by 100 and rounded to the nearest integer, where P(n) is the partition number A000041(n).
%C A242615 The original definition was "Number of messages maximally transmittable by using n objects as a non-sequenced collection, expressed as a percentage of the number of messages maximally transmittable by using n objects as a sequenced collection."
%C A242615 This sequence compares the number of distinct (distinguishable) states a collection can be in. There are two ways to read symbols off a collection: the sequential and the commutative ways. In an idealized case, the objects seen as sequentially ordered will each possess one symbol which individuates this element fully against all other elements in the collection. Then, there are n! distinct states of the collection achievable. This is also the maximal number of messages that can be transmitted by using n objects as elements in a sequence.
%C A242615 Reading the collection by building groups among elements that share a symbol one arrives at an upper limit, here called for ease of comparison "n?", which is given by the number of partitions of n raised to the power of the logarithm of the number of partitions of n.
%C A242615 Being sequenced or non-sequenced is a property that the human spectator looks into the collection (cf. Rorschach-Test). The collection itself possesses the immanent, intrinsic property of being both sequenced and non-sequenced.
%C A242615 The discussion centers on what is known in data processing as sequential vs. index-based retrieval. We investigate how many index queries are necessary until one identifies each one specific element of a data set; would this method be more efficient than the usual method of assigning each element a sequential number.
%C A242615 The numbers show that a translation exists between group and sequential properties. The non-integer result for n? comes from the decreasing probability of successive index searches to bring forth such elements that have not yet been found in the course of previous index searches.
%C A242615 The interplay between linear and nonlinear order concepts can be used efficiently and practically by making use of the chains that connect elements into groups (thus creating commutative, contemporary group relations) and at the same time assigning to each element a sequential number that refers to the place within the chains' succession. (Cf. A235647 for a definition of chains.)
