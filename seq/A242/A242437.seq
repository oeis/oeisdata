%N A242437 Numbers not appearing in the sequence of integers, beginning with 1, that can be formed by adding any digit of any previous term to that previous term.
%C A242437 Is this sequence finite?  Any additional term > 10^8.
%C A242437 If we start with an integer other than 1, different sequences appear.  3, 5, and 7 appear in none of these sequences starting with any n less than the integer in question.  Are there any other integers, like 3, 5, and 7, that do not appear in any sequence starting with n less than the integer in question?
%C A242437 This sequence includes all terms from A241175 plus additional terms that cannot be made from the terms that are included in A241175.
%e A242437 17 is not in this sequence because 1+1=2, 2+2=4, 4+4=8, 8+8=16, 16+1=17.
%e A242437 39 is not in this sequence because 1+1=2, 2+2=4, 4+4=8, 8+8=16, 16+6=22, 22+2=24, 24+4=28, 28+8=36, 36+3=39.
%e A242437 23 is in this sequence because there is no way to start at 1 and arrive at 23.
