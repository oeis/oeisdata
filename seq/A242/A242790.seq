%N A242790 Number of connected diamond-free graphs on n nodes.
%C A242790 An equivalent definition: Number of simple connected graphs with n nodes that have no subgraph isomorphic to the diamond graph or the complete graph K_4. This is the same because a graph contains a diamond as a subgraph iff it contains a diamond or K_4 as induced subgraph. - _Falk Hüffner_, Jan 11 2015
