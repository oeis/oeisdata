%N A242018 Starting with a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, repeatedly append to this sequence the last half of the currently-existing terms, taking the longer half if there are an odd number of terms.
%C A242018 The length of this sequence after n iterations of appending its last half to itself is given by A061419(n+3).
%C A242018 The proportion of terms that are 1 in this sequence appears to be about 0.7017...
%C A242018 The first occurrence of n consecutive 1s occur at indices 2, 4, 7, 26, 27308, ... (A242020). It is unknown whether or not this sequence contains arbitrarily-long runs of consecutive 1s.

%e A242018 The sequence starts "0, 0, 1".
%e A242018 We then add "0, 1" to the end of the sequence, giving "0, 0, 1, 0, 1".
%e A242018 We then add "1, 0, 1" to the end of the sequence, giving "0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1".
%e A242018 We then add "1, 1, 0, 1" to the end of the sequence, giving "0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1".
%e A242018 The present sequence is obtained by iterating this procedure indefinitely, always appending the last half of the sequence to itself.
