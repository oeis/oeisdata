%N A162534 A positive integer k is included if every length of the runs of 0's and 1's in the binary representation of k divides k.
%C A162534 By "run" of 0's or 1's, it is meant: Think of binary k as a string of 0's and 1's. A single run of the digit b (0 or 1) is made up completely of consecutive digits all equal to b, and is bounded on its end by either the digit 1-b or the end of the string.

%e A162534 198 in binary is 11000110. There are two runs of two 1's each in this representation, and a run of three 0's and a run of one 0. Since 198 is divisible by each of these lengths (1,2, and 3), 198 is in the sequence.
