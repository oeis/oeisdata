%N A162592 Hypotenuse numbers A009003 which cannot be represented as sum of 2 distinct nonzero squares.
%C A162592 Numbers with both at least one prime factor of form 4k+1 (which makes the square decomposable into the sum of two squares), and with at least one prime factor of form 4k+3 to an odd multiplicity (which makes the number itself not decomposable). This is a direct consequence of Fermat's Christmas theorem on the sum of two squares (Fermat announced its proof - without giving it - in a letter to Mersenne dated December 25, 1640). - _Jean-Christophe Hervé_, Nov 19 2013
%C A162592 Numbers n such that n^2 is the sum of two nonzero squares while n is not. Also note that sequence is equivalent to "Hypotenuse numbers A009003 which cannot be represented as sum of 2 nonzero squares." The reason is, if n is the sum of two nonzero squares in exactly one way and n = a^2 + a^2, then n^2 cannot be the sum of two nonzero squares. - _Altug Alkan_, Apr 14 2016
