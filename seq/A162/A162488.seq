%N A162488 Numbers x such that x^y + y^x is prime, for some y>1, y<x.
%C A162488 This sequence lists the values occurring in A162486.
%C A162488 Sequences A162489 and A162490 list the corresponding (smallest possible) y values and primes.

%C A162488 Some terms could appear more than once, such as 114, 318 & 590. - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Aug 17 2009
%F A162488 a(n)^A162489(n) + A162489(n)^a(n) = A162490(n).
%e A162488 The least x such that x^y + y^x is prime for some y>1, y<x is a(1)=3, the smallest such y is a(1)=2, yielding the prime A162490(1) = 9 + 8 = 17.
%e A162488 The least x > a(4)=21 such that x^y + y^x is prime for some y<x, y>1, is a(5)=24, yielding the prime A162490(5) for y=A162489(5)=5, while A162486(5)=33, yielding the smaller prime A094133(5)=8589935681 with y=A162487(5), comes only after a(6)=32.
