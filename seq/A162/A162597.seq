%N A162597 Ordered hypotenuses of primitive Pythagorean triangles, A008846, which are not hypotenuses of non-primitive Pythagorean triangles with any shorter legs.
%C A162597 Hypotenuses of primitive Pythagorean triangles are shown in A008846 and A020882, and may also be hypotenuses of non-primitive Pythagorean triangles (see A009177, A118882). The sequence contains those hypotenuses of A008846 where in the set of Pythagorean triangles with this hypotenuse the one with the shortest leg is a primitive one.
%C A162597 This ordering first on hypotenuses, then filtering on the shortest legs, and then selecting the primitive triangles removes 125, 169, 205, 289, 305, 425, etc. from A008846.
%e A162597 The hypotenuse 25 appears in the triangle 25^2 = 7^2 + 24^2 (primitive) and in the triangle 25^2 = 15^2 + 20^2 (non-primitive). The triangle with the shortest leg (here: 7) is primitive, so 25 is in the sequence.
%e A162597 The hypotenuse 125 appears in the triangles 125^2 = 35^2 + 120^2 (non-primitive), 125^2 = 44^2 + 117^2 (primitive), 125^2 = 75^2 + 100^2 (non-primitive). The case with the shortest leg (here: 35) of these 3 is not primitive, so 125 is not in the sequence.
