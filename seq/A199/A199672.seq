%N A199672 Denominators of upper rational approximants of Pi with the first 5 terms given by Adam Adamandy Kochański in 1685, continued using a reconstruction by Fukś that is highly likely to match Kochański's incompletely published method.
%C A199672 The corresponding numerators are given in A199671.

%F A199672 a(1) = 7;
%F A199672 a(n) = a(n-1)*(A191642(n-1) + 1) + 1, where A191642 are Kochański's "genitores".
%e A199672 a(1) = 7 because Kochański's first lower bound was 25/8 = A199657(1)/A199658(1) and his first upper bound was 22/7 = A199671(1)/a(1).
%e A199672 a(2) = a(1) * (A191642(1) + 1) + 1 = 7*(15 + 1) + 1 = 112 + 1 = 113,
%e A199672 a(3) = a(2) * (A191642(2) + 1) + 1 = 113*(4697 + 1) + 1 = 530875,
%e A199672 a(4) = a(3) * (A191642(3) + 1) + 1 = 530875*(5548 + 1) + 1 = 2945825376.
