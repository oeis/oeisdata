%N A199657 Numerators of lower rational approximants of Pi with the first 5 terms given by Adam Adamandy Kochański in 1685, continued using a reconstruction by Fukś that is highly likely to match Kochański's incompletely published method.
%C A199657 The corresponding denominators are given in A199658.
%C A199657 The reconstruction refers to the calculation of the "genitores" in A191642, for which Kochański only announced that he would describe them in more detail in a future work: "I will explain the aforementioned method more completely in Polymathic thoughts and inventions, which work, if God prolongs my life, I have decided to put out for public benefit" (translation from Latin by H. Fukś).

%F A199657 a(1) = 25; R(1) = A199671(1) = 22;
%F A199657 a(n) = R(n-1)*A191642(n-1) + 3, where A191642 are Kochański's "genitores";
%F A199657 R(n) = R(n-1)*(A191642(n-1) + 1) + 3;
%e A199657 a(1) = 25 because Kochański's first lower bound was 25/8 = a(1)/A199658(1) and his first upper bound was 22/7 = A199671(1)/A199672(1).
%e A199657 a(2) = R(1) * A191642(1) + 3 = 22*15 + 3 = 330 + 3 = 333,
%e A199657 R(2) = R(1) * (A191642(1) + 1 ) + 3 = 22*(15 + 1) + 3 = 355 = A199671(2).
