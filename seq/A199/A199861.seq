%N A199861 The decimal expansion (unsigned) of the value of d that maximizes the Brahmagupta expression given below.
%C A199861 Brahmagupta expression sqrt((-1+1/(1+d)+1/(1+2d)+1/(1+3d)) * (1-1/(1+d)+1/(1+2d)+1/(1+3d)) * (1+1/(1+d)-1/(1+2d)+1/(1+3d)) * (1+1/(1+d)+1/(1+2d)-1/(1+3d)))/4 for d in the interval [-1/3, inf] where 1/(1+d), 1/(1+2d) and 1/(1+3d) are always positive.
%C A199861 The area of a convex quadrilateral with fixed sides is maximal when it is organized as a convex cyclic quadrilateral. Furthermore in order that a quadrilateral can have sides in a harmonic progression 1 : 1/(1+d) : 1/(1+2d) : 1/(1+3d) its denominator's common difference d is limited to the range f < d < g where f is the constant A199590 and g is the constant A199589. Consequently when d=-0.2271064482... it maximizes Brahmagupta's expression for the area of a convex cyclic quadrilateral whose sides form a harmonic progression.
