%N A165143 Length of longest cyclic knight path on an n X n chessboard that is determined (up to starting point and direction) by the fields visited.
%C A165143 More mathematically, a(n) is also the biggest possible number of vertices (or edges) of a circular graph in the plane with all vertices being distinct and having integer coordinates between 1 and n, inclusive, and all edges having length sqrt(5).
%C A165143 Opinions on a(1) and a(2) may differ: The only possible circular path consists of staying at the starting field, hence we have 1 field visited (thus a(1) = a(2) = 1) or it takes 0 knight moves to complete the tour (thus a(1) = a(2) = 0). The graph with one vertex and no edges is not considered a cyclic graph since all vertices must have degree two; even adding a loop edge would produce an edge of length 0 (thus a(1) and a(2) are either undefined or = 0 if one accepts the empty graph as cyclic).
%C A165143 Put another way, a(n) is the length of a longest induced cycle in the n X n knight graph. - _Pontus von Brömssen_, Oct 02 2022

%F A165143 From _Pontus von Brömssen_, Jan 30 2023: (Start)
%F A165143 a(n) = n^2/2 + O(n) (Beluhov 2023).
%F A165143 a(n) <= A357500(n)+1.

%e A165143 The eight non-center fields of a 3 X 3 chessboard can be visited cyclically in a unique manner up to selection of starting point and clockwise vs. counterclockwise direction; since the center field cannot be part of a (longer) cycle, we have a(3) = 8.
