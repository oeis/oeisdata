%N A165632 Sizes of tatami-free rooms.
%C A165632 Even numbers s such that some rectangle of size s=r*c (r,c positive integers) cannot be tiled with tatamis of size 1x2 such that not more than 3 tatamis meet at any point.
%C A165632 The number of different rectangles of size a(n) which have this property is given in A165633(n).
%H A165632 Project Euler, <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=256">Problem 256: Tatami-Free Rooms</a>.
%F A165632 Equals { r*c in 2Z | A068920(r,c)=0 }.
%e A165632 a(1)=70 because the rectangle of size 7x10 is the smallest that cannot be filled with 2x1 tiles without having 4 tiles meet in some point.
