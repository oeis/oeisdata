%N A165249 Those positive integers n where the number of 1's, when n is written in binary, on the left half of the binary representation equals the number of 1's on the right half of the binary representation.
%C A165249 The middle binary digit of those positive integers with an odd number of binary digits can be considered to either be on both the left and the right side of the number, or to be on neither side. In other words, the middle binary digit can be ignored.
%C A165249 We could instead count the 0's in both halves of the binary representations. If the number of 0's is the same for both halves of the binary representation of n, then n is in this sequence.
%C A165249 All positive integers that are palindromes in binary are in this sequence. Non-binary-palindromes that are in this sequence are found in sequence A165250.

%e A165249 46 in binary is 101110. Splitting the binary representation down the middle, we have (101)(110). Since there are exactly the same number (two) of 1's in both halves, then 46 is in this sequence.
