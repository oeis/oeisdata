%N A165404 The positions of zeros in the top row of A163898 (and A163899).
%C A165404 Equivalently, the positions of ones in the top row of A163904.
%C A165404 From _Jeffrey Shallit_, Jan 18 2026: (Start)
%C A165404 k is in the sequence if and only if the automaton given in the Shallit link accepts the binary representation of k.
%C A165404 Equivalently, k is in the sequence if and only if A163482(k) = A000695(k). (End)
%C A165404 k is in the sequence if and only if it is the encoding of the possible contents of pin 2 when carrying out the optimal algorithm for the Hanoi tower problem on infinitely many disks.  For example, the fact that 6 is in the sequence, but not 5, indicates that pin 2 holds disks 1 and 2 at some point, but never disks 0 and 2. - _Jeffrey Shallit_, Feb 09 2026
