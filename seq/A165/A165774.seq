%N A165774 Largest solution to phi(x) = n!, where phi() is Euler totient function (A000010).
%C A165774 All solutions to phi(x) = n! belong to the interval [n!,(n+1)!] and are listed in the n-th row of A165773 (when written as table with row lengths A055506). Thus this sequence gives the last element in these rows, i.e., a(n) = A165773(Sum_{k=1..n} A055506(k)).
%C A165774 All terms in this sequence are even, since if x is an odd solution to phi(x) = n!, then 2x is a larger solution because phi(2x) = phi(2)*phi(x) = phi(x).
%C A165774 Most terms (and any term divisible by 4) are divisible by 3, since if x = 2^k*y is a solution with k>1 and gcd(y,2*3) = 1, then x*3/2 = 2^(k-1)*3*y is a larger solution because phi(2^(k-1)*3) = 2^(k-2)*(3-1) = 2^(k-1) = phi(2^k).
%C A165774 For the same reason, most terms are divisible by 5, since if x=2^k*y is a solution with k>2 and gcd(y,2*5) = 1, then x*5/4 is a larger solution.
%C A165774 Also, any term of the form x = 2^k*3^m*y with k,m>1 must be divisible by 7 (else x*7/6 would be a larger solution), and so on.
%C A165774 Experimentally, a(n) = c(n)*(n+1)! with a coefficient c(n) ~ 2^(-n/10) (e.g., c(1) = c(2) = 1, c(10) ~ 0.5).
