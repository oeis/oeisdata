%N A165556 A symmetric version of the Josephus problem read modulo 2.
%C A165556 We put n numbers in a circle, and in this variant two numbers are to be eliminated at the same time.
%C A165556 These two processes of elimination go in different directions. Suppose that there are n numbers.
%C A165556 Then the first process of elimination starts with the first number and the 2nd, 4th, 6th numbers, ... are to be eliminated.
%C A165556 The second process starts with the n-th number, and the (n-1)st, (n-3)rd, (n-5)th numbers, ... are to be eliminated.
%C A165556 We suppose that the first process comes first and the second process second at every stage.
%C A165556 We denote the position of the last survivor by JI(n). If we use this sequence under mod 2, then we get the above sequence with 1 and 0.
%C A165556 Old name was "{1,1}, {1, 0, 1, 0}, {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0}, {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0}, ... In this way the two patterns {1,1} and {0,1} take turns in subsequences with the length of 2, 4, 8, 16, 64,...".

%e A165556 Suppose that there are n = 14 numbers.
%e A165556 Then the 2nd, 4th, and 6th numbers will be eliminated by the first process. Similarly the 13th, 11th, and 9th numbers will be eliminated by the second process.
%e A165556 Now two directions are going to overlap. The first process will eliminate the 8, 12 and the second process will eliminate 5, 1.
%e A165556 After this the first process will eliminate 3, 14, and the second process will eliminate 10. The number that remains is 7. Therefore JI(14) = 7 and JI(14) = 1 (mod 2).
