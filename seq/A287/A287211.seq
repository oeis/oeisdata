%N A287211 The number of plane rooted complete ternary trees with 2n+1 unlabeled leaves (hence n internal nodes including the root where n starts at 0) satisfying these two conditions: (1) if one of the three children of any internal node is the greatest in deglex order then that child is not the leftmost child; (2) if one of the three children of any internal node is the smallest in deglex order then that child is not the rightmost child. Deglex order refers to degree-lexicographical order defined inductively on the number of leaves (see details under Comments).
%C A287211 "Plane" means "embedded in the plane" or (equivalently) the three children of each internal node (including the root) are ordered left, middle, right. Deglex order on trees with 2n+1 leaves is defined as follows: to compare two such trees T and U with children T_1, T_2, T_3 and U_1, U_2, U_3, first find the least index 1 <= i <= 3 for T_i <> U_i, then compare T_i and U_i in deglex order already defined inductively on trees with fewer than 2n+1 leaves; note that this requires comparing trees with different numbers of leaves, so we say that T_i precedes U_i if either (i) T_i has fewer leaves than U_i, or (ii) T_i and U_i have the same number of leaves, and T_i precedes U_i in deglex order.
%C A287211 An alternative description of this sequence: it counts the distinct association types in arity 2n+1 for a ternary operation [a,b,c] satisfying the cyclic-sum relation [a,b,c] + [b,c,a] + [c,a,b] = 0. The two conditions stated under "Name" are necessary to deal with the possibility of repeated factors: [a,a,b], [a,b,a], [b,a,a] where a < b in deglex order, and [a,b,b], [b,a,b], [b,b,a] where a < b in deglex order.
