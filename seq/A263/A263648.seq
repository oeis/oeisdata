%N A263648 a(1)=4, a(2)=9: a(n) is the smallest semiprime not yet appearing in the sequence which is coprime to a(n-1) and not coprime to a(n-2).
%C A263648 Contrary to what might be expected (see comment after Proof), a(n) is not a permutation of all semiprimes; it is a permutation of even semiprimes {S_2} and semiprimes with smallest factor 3 {S_3}, plus {25, 35, 49, 77}. Proof (Start):
%C A263648 i. The sequence is infinite: we can always consider p*q for a(n+1), where p is the smallest factor in a(n-1) and q is the smallest prime > than the largest factor of any term already appearing in the sequence;
%C A263648 ii. a(15)=38 = 2*19 = 2*prime(8) and a(16)=33 = 3*11 = 3*prime(5);
%C A263648 iii. all {S_2} <= 38 and {S_3} <= 33 have appeared up to a(16), with 38 and 33 being maximum terms in {S_2} and {S_3}, respectively;
%C A263648 iv. all semiprimes with smallest factor >= 5 which are < 2*prime(9)=46 and 3*prime(6)=39 have appeared up to a(16). Consequently, the terms starting at a(17)=46 alternate between 2*prime(k) and 3*prime(k-3) k=9..infinity.
%C A263648 v. the only other numbers to have appeared are {25, 35, 49, 77}.
%C A263648 (End)
%C A263648 The above behavior is in contrast to A119718 (a permutation of all semiprimes because it lacks the constraint of a(n) being not coprime to a(n-2)). Interestingly, this sequence (A263648) shares the same essential rules as A098550 (the Yellowstone permutation) and many of its variations, while A119718 does not; one therefore might expect the opposite behavior to occur between this sequence and A119718. What observations or generalizations might we draw from this?
