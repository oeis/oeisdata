%N A263447 Arrange the 26 sporadic simple groups in increasing order; a(n) = number of sporadic simple groups which are subquotients of the n-th largest sporadic simple group.
%C A263447 A group is a subquotient of itself, so a(n) >= 1.
%C A263447 It is well-known that a(26) = 20, the so-called "happy family". Trivially a(1) = 1 and a(2) = 2 since M_11 is a subquotient of M_12.
%C A263447 The sequence was generated from the diagram of subquotient relations on page 238 of the ATLAS, together with the update that J_1 is not involved in M (which replaces the single question mark in the table with a plus sign).
