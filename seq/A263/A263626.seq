%N A263626 Number of inequivalent self-complementary Seidel matrices of order n.
%C A263626 From _Petros Hadjicostas_, Mar 01 2021: (Start)
%C A263626 On p. 9 of their arxiv paper, Greaves et al. (2014-2015) state that "The number of self-complementary Seidel matrices is known explicitly" and refer to Sozański (1980). The authors apparently refer to formula (20) in Theorem 2 (p. 139) in Sozański (1980). (See also p. 218 in  Greaves et al. (2016).)
%C A263626 The so-called "Seidel matrix" of a graph G was apparently introduced by the Dutch mathematician Johan Jacob Seidel (1967, 1968, and with van Lint in 1966). They are not related to the so-called Euler-Seidel (or just Seidel) matrices named after Leonhard Euler and Philipp Ludwig von Seidel.
%C A263626 A Seidel matrix S = S(G) of a simple labeled graph G with vertex set V = {v_1, ..., v_n} is an n x n symmetric matrix with rows and columns corresponding to the n vertices such that S(i,j) is defined in the following way: S(i,j) = 0 iff i = j; S(i,j) = -1 iff vertex v_i is connected to vertex v_j (i <> j), and S(i,j) = 1 iff vertex v_i is not connected to vertex v_j (i <> j). Thus, S(G) = J - I - 2*A(G), where J is an n x n matrix of 1's, I is the n x n identity matrix, and A(G) is the adjancecy matrix of the labeled graph G.
%C A263626 Two Seidel matrices S1 and S2 are said to be equivalent if S1 can be obtained from S2 by a sequence of simultaneous row i to j and column i to j permutations or by a simultaneous multiplication of a row i and a column i by -1.
%C A263626 Thus, Seidel matrices S1 and S2 are equivalent iff there is a symmetric signed permutation matrix P such that S1 = P*S2*P^T.
%C A263626 A Seidel matrix S is called "self-complementary" if S is equivalent to -S. Thus, S is self-complementary iff there is a symmetric signed permutation matrix P such that S = -P*S*P^T. The sequence a(n) counts equivalence classes of self-complementary n x n Seidel matrices.
%C A263626 In terms of a labeled graph G with Seidel matrix S and vertex set V, a simultaneous row i to j and column i to j permutation of S corresponds to exchanging labels between vertices v_i and v_j. On the other hand, a simultaneous multiplication of row i and column i by -1 corresponds to what Mallows and Sloane (1975) call "switching at node" v_i: if A(i) is the set of vertices in V to which v_i is connected and B(i) is the set of vertices in V to which v_i is not connected, "switching at node v_i" means switching the sets A(i) and B(i) (the vertices connected with the vertices non-connected to v_i). Of course, either A(i) or B(i) may be empty.
%C A263626 Mallows and Sloane (1975) proved that the number of equivalence classes of Seidel matrices of order n is equal to the number of unlabeled even graphs (known colloquially as unlabeled "Euler graphs"). See sequence A002854.
%C A263626 The equivalence class of graphs corresponding to a self-complementary Seidel matrix is closed under complementation.
%C A263626 For simplicity, in the examples below that illustrate equivalence classes Seidel matrices, we only include unlabeled graphs on n = 3 or n = 4 nodes rather than labeled ones. (End)

%F A263626 a(n) = 0 for 3 == n mod 4 (see the references).
%F A263626 Conjecture (due to _Peter Luschny_): a(n) = Sum_{k=0}^{n*(n-1)/2} (-1)^k*A341941(n,k) = [o.g.f. of n-th row of A341941](x=-1).
%F A263626 a(n) = Sum_{p in M2(n)} 2^(I2(p) - I1(p))/f(p), where
%F A263626 p = (p[1], ..., p[n]) is a partition of n written in frequency or multiplicity notation with p[i] >= 0 for i = 1..n and Sum_{i=1..n} i*p[i] = n;
%F A263626 M2(n) is the set of all partitions p of n with either (a) p[i] = 0 for all odd i or (b) p[1] = 1 or 2, and p[i] = 0 for i >= 2 with 0 <> (i mod 4);
%F A263626 f(p) = Product_{i=1..n} p[i]!*i^p[i];
%F A263626 J(p) = Sum_{j=1..floor((n-1)/2)} p[2*j+1];
%F A263626 I1(p) = Sum_{i=1..n} p[i] - if(J(p) == 0, 0, 1); and
%F A263626 I2(p) = (Sum_{1 <= i, j <= n} p[i]*p[j]*gcd(i,j) - J(p))/2.
%F A263626 (This is modification of formula (20) in Theorem 2 (p. 139) in Sozański (1980).)
%F A263626 Note that, if we take sum over all partitions of n, rather than just over M2(n), then we get A002854(n).
%F A263626 If, on the other hand, we consider Sum_{p in M1(n)} 2^I2(p)/f(p), where M1(n) is the set of all partitions p of n with p[1] in {0,1} and p[i] = 0 for i >= 2 with 0 <> (i mod 4), then we get A000171(n).
%F A263626 Finally, if we consider Sum_{p} 2^I2(p)/f(p) over all partitions p of n, then we get A000088(n). (End)
%e A263626 From _Petros Hadjicostas_, Mar 01 2021: (Start)
%e A263626 For n = 3, we have the following A000088(3) = 4 unlabeled graphs on 3 nodes:
%e A263626 (1) o     (2)  o      (3)  o      (4)  o
%e A263626               / \         /           / \
%e A263626   o   o      o   o       o   o       o-- o
%e A263626 Graphs (1) and (2) form one equivalence class and graphs (3) and (4) form another equivalence class (under the Seidel-Mallows-Sloane "switching" equivalence relation). The complement of (1) is (4) and the complement of (2) is (3), so there are no self-complementary classes; i.e., a(3) = 0. (Here, the number of equivalence classes is A002854(3) = 2.)
%e A263626 For n = 4, the A000088(4) = 11 unlabeled graphs are listed in Mallows and Sloane (1975). There are A002854(4) = 3 equivalence classes, only one of which is self-complementary:
%e A263626 (1) o  o   (2) o -- o   (3) o--o   (4) o  o   (5) o--o
%e A263626     |          |            |          | /|       | /|
%e A263626     o  o       o    o       o--o       o--o       o--o
%e A263626 Thus, a(4) = 1. (End)
