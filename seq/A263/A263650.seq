%N A263650 A variation on A098550 (the Yellowstone permutation): a(n)=n for 1 <= n <= 3, a(4)=5; otherwise a(n) = smallest number not yet appearing in the sequence which is coprime to a(n-1) and not coprime to a(n-2).
%C A263650 Proof that this is a permutation of the natural numbers follows the same basic format as the proof contained in A098550.
%C A263650 This sequence is one in a multitude of permutations of definable infinite sets (i.e., "infinite permutations") which share similar properties and similar proofs as A098550 (Yellowstone-type), and which are often (though not always - see for example A119718 and A255582) of the general form: a(n) is smallest number not yet appearing in the sequence which is coprime to a(n-1) and not coprime to a(n-2). But caution is warranted here: many sequences which may appear at first glance to be Yellowstone-type infinite permutations are not (e.g., A263648 is infinite, similar in structure to A119718 and even MORE similar to the general Yellowstone form, yet is not a permutation) or may not be provable in similar fashion (e.g., A254077, which is similar in structure to A255582 but cannot be demonstrated as infinite using Yellowstone-type constructions). What observations or generalizations might we draw from this?
