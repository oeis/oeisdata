%C A130905 a(n) is also the number of oriented simple graphs on n labeled vertices, such that each weakly connected component with 3 or more vertices is a directed cycle. - _Austin Shapiro_, Apr 17 2009
%C A130905 The Kn2p sums, p>=1, see A180662 for the definition of these sums, of triangle A193229 lead to this sequence. - _Johannes W. Meijer_, Jul 21 2011
%C A130905 Compare with A000266 with e.g.f. exp( -x^2 / 2) / (1 - x). - _Michael Somos_, Jul 24 2011
%C A130905 a(n) is the number of permutations of an n-set where each transposition (two cycle) is counted twice. That is, each transposition is an involution and is its own inverse, but if we imagine each transposition can be oriented in one of two ways, then a permutation with oriented transpositions is just a oriented simple graph. Conversely, an oriented simple graph with restrictions on connected components comes from a permutation with oriented transpositions. - _Michael Somos_, Jul 25 2011

%e A130905 a(2) = 3 because there are 3 oriented simple graphs on two labeled vertices. a(3) = 9 because for oriented simple graphs on three labeled vertices there is 1 with no edges, 6 with one edge, 0 with two edges, and 2 with three edges which are directed cycles such that each weakly connected component with 3 or more vertices is a directed cycle.
