%N A130588 Integers which are not the sum of a 3-almost prime and a prime.
%C A130588 T. D. Noe found no more values up to 10000 and agrees with my conjecture that this sequence is probably finite. This is related to Chen's Theorem: "Every 'large' even number may be written as 2n = p + m where p is a prime and m in A001358 is the set of semiprimes (i.e., 2-almost primes)" which itself is related to Goldbach's conjecture. However, we have no proof, merely the sense that it gets easier and easier to find more and more A014612(i) + A000040(j) = n decompositions as n increases.
%F A130588 {n such that for no integers i, j is it the case that A014612(i) + A000040(j) = n}.
%e A130588 n<10 are in this sequence because the smallest 3-almost prime is 8, hence the smallest 3-almost prime plus prime is 10 = 8 + 2. We have that 282 is not in this sequence because 282 = 125 + 157 = A014612(30) + A000040(37).
