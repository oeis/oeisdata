%N A130173 Starting points of stapled intervals.
%C A130173 A finite sequence of n consecutive positive integers is called "stapled" if each element in the sequence is not relatively prime to at least one other element in the sequence.
%C A130173 In other words, an interval is stapled if for every element x there is another element y (different from x) such that gcd(x,y)>1.
%C A130173 The shortest stapled interval has length 17 and starts with the number 2184.
%C A130173 It is interesting to notice that the intervals [27829,27846] and [27828,27846] are stapled while the interval [27828,27845] is not.
%C A130173 It is clear that a stapled interval [a,b] may not contain a prime number greater than b/2 (as such a prime would be coprime to every other element of the interval).
%C A130173 Together with Bertrand's Postulate this implies a>b/2 or b<2a. And it follows that
%C A130173 * a stapled interval may not contain prime numbers at all;
%C A130173 * for any particular positive integer a, we can determine if it is a starting point of some stapled interval.
