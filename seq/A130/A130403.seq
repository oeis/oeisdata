%N A130403 Signature permutations of SPINE-transformations of A057163-conjugates of Catalan automorphisms in table A122204.
%C A130403 Row n is the signature permutation of the Catalan automorphism which is obtained from A057163-conjugate of the n-th automorphism in the table A122204 with the recursion scheme "SPINE", i.e. row n is obtained as SPINE(A057163 o ENIPS(A089840[n]) o A057163). See A122203 and A122204 for the description of SPINE and ENIPS. Each row occurs only once in this table. Inverses of these permutations can be found in table A130402. This table contains also all the rows of A122203 and A089840.
%Y A130403 Cf. The first 22 rows of this table: row 0 (identity permutation): A001477, 1: A082345, 2: A130936, 3: A073288, 4: A130942, 5: A130940, 6: A130938, 7: A130944, 8: A130946, 9: A130952, 10: A130950, 11: A130948, 12: A057161, 13: A130962, 14: A130964, 15: A069767, 16: A130966, 17: A074688, 18: A130954, 19: A130956, 20: A130960, 21: A130958, Other rows: 169: A069770, 3617: A082339, 65167: A057501.
%Y A130403 Cf. also tables A089840, A122201-A122204, A122285-A122286, A130400-A130401.
%Y A130403 Cf. As a sequence differs from A130403 for the first time at n=92, where a(n)=21, while A130403(n)=22.
