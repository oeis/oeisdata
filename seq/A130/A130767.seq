%N A130767 a(n) = product{k=1 to n} (k-th integer from among those positive integers which are coprime to (n+1-k)).
%C A130767 a(n) is the product of the terms in the n-th antidiagonal of the A126572 array. - _Michel Marcus_, Mar 14 2018
%e A130767 The integers coprime to 1 are: 1,2,3,4,5,6,... The 5th of these is 5. The integers coprime to 2 are: 1,3,5,7,9,... The 4th of these is 7. The integers coprime to 3 are: 1,2,4,5,7,... The 3rd of these is 4. The integers coprime to 4 are: 1,3,5,... The 2nd of these is 3. And the integers coprime to 5 are: 1,2,3,4,6,... The first of these is 1. So a(5) = 5 * 7 * 4 * 3 * 1 = 420.
