%N A009190 "2p twin peaks": a(n) = least x with lpf(x) = lpf(x + 2p) = p = prime(n) and lpf(y) < p for all x < y < x + 2p, where lpf = least prime factor; a(p) = -1 if no such x exists.
%C A009190 For prime p, a 2p-twin peak is a number x such that lpf(x) = lpf(x+2p) = p and x < y < x+2p => lpf(y) < p. (lpf(n) = least prime factor of n). p = 71 is the smallest prime admitting a 2p-twin peak.
%C A009190 a(30) <= 126972592296404970720882679404584182254788131, found by Manjul Bhargava, John Conway, Johan de Jong, and Derek Smith in 1997. - _Mauro Fiorentini_, Feb 16 2020 [Comment corrected by _N. J. A. Sloane_, Aug 19 2020: they found an upper bound on a(30), they did not prove it is equal to a(30). A typo in the names has also been corrected.]
%C A009190 a(1), ..., a(13) = -1, as the sequence of integers with small least prime factor is not long enough, see A058989; the minimum prime for which twin peaks exist is between 43 (a(14)) and 71 (a(20)). - _Mauro Fiorentini_, Feb 17 2020
%C A009190 It is (weakly) conjectured that a(n) = -1 for 14 <= n <= 19, which is why this entry has offset 20. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Aug 19 2020

%F A009190 Assuming a(n) > 0, then a(n) < A002110(n)/2, since if (x,x+2p) is a 2p-twin peak, then so is (q-x-2p,q-x), where q=A034386(p). - _M. F. Hasler_, Jan 28 2014
