%N A085229 Smallest number which is coprime to n and to a(n-1), and is not yet in the sequence; a(1)=1.
%C A085229 Permutation of natural numbers with inverse A085230: a(A085230(n))=A085230(a(n))=n.
%C A085229 From _Michael De Vlieger_, Apr 13 2022: (Start)
%C A085229 Theorem 1: 2 | a(2k+1) for k > 0, consequence of the lexically earliest and coprimality axioms. Even numbers appear in order as a consequence of the latter axiom and since numbers are either even or odd.
%C A085229 Corollary: the only fixed point is a(1) = 1.
%C A085229 Theorem 2: Generally, if prime p | a(n) then p is coprime to a(n +/- 1). For p = 2, 2 | a(2k+1) for k > 0 since 2 is the smallest prime. For odd p it is not necessarily true that given p | a(n) -> p | a(n+2) or p | a(n-2), since there may be a smaller m such that (a(n-1), m) = 1, q | m for prime q < p, and is not in a(1..n-1).
%C A085229 For these reasons, if we also set a(2) = 3, then we need not also check (n, a(n)) = 1, since it isn't possible. If we do not check (n, a(n)) = 1 and set a(2) = 3, 2 would follow 1 since 1 is coprime to all numbers.
%C A085229 Theorem 3: 3 | a(3k+1) for k > 1. Proof: For even k, 6 | a(3k+1), i.e., 6 | a(n) : n mod 6 = 1, and it is easy to see that since even numbers appear in order in the sequence, these even multiples of 3 are also in order. Because 3 | a(n) : n mod 6 = 1, we cannot have 3 | a(n) for n congruent to 0 or 2 (mod 6). Furthermore, we know that 2 | a(n) for n congruent to 3 or 5 (mod 6). So 3 | a(n) odd : n mod 6 = 4, that is, 3 | a(3k+1) for k > 1.
%C A085229 Theorem 4: Odd primes q set records. Proof: (q, a(n-1)) = 1 as a consequence of lexically earliest axiom that rules out equality, and by the definition of prime. 2 is displaced on account of the axiom that bans equality between n and a(n). Therefore, whereupon q is the smallest unused odd number, it enters the sequence.
%C A085229 A consequence of theorems 1 and 3 is that powers of 2 and those of 3 excepting 3 itself do not set records, since their adjacency is governed by a(n-1). The powers of other primes do set records since coprimality does not depend on multiplicity.
%C A085229 The smallest composite record is a(24) = 25. Smallest record m with omega(m) > 1 is a(54) = 55. Powers of 2 and 3 are absent from records for n <= 2^20. (End)
