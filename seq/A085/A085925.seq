%N A085925 a(n) is taken to be the smallest positive integer greater than a(n-1) which is consistent with the condition "n is a member of the sequence if and only if a(n) is not prime".
%e A085925 a(4) = 6 because 4 is in the sequence and 6 is the next nonprime after a(3). a(5) = 7 because 5 is not in the sequence and 7 is the next prime after a(4).
