%N A085124 Smallest multiple of n whose digital product is also a positive multiple of n, or 0 if no such number exists.
%C A085124 a(n) = 0 if n is not a term of A002473 (i.e., not a 7-smooth number).
%C A085124 a(n) = 0 if n is a multiple of 10.
%C A085124 Conjecture: otherwise, a(n) is positive.
%C A085124 Sequence may be redefined to avoid large number of zeros by restricting it to members of A002473 which are not divisible by 10.
