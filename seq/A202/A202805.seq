%N A202805 a(n) is the largest k in an n_nacci(k) sequence (Fibonacci(k) for n=2, tribonacci(k) for n=3, etc.) such that n_nacci(k) >= 2^(k-n-1).
%C A202805 From _Frank M Jackson_, Jul 02 2023: (Start)
%C A202805 The family of Fibonacci sequences {2_nacci, 3_nacci,...,n_nacci} where 2_nacci is the Fibonacci sequence, 3_nacci is the tribonacci sequence etc. are all sequences that can be used as bases to code an integer because they are "complete" (sic) sequences. For instance, the Zenkendorf representation of integers as the sum of distinct Fibonacci numbers can be found using a greedy algorithm.
%C A202805 If the n_nacci sequence starts with an offset of 0, then n_nacci(k) = 0 for 0 <= k <= n-2 and n_nacci(n-1) = 1. Thereafter, n_nacci(k) for k >= n continues as the sum of its previous n terms. This means that n_nacci(k) = 2^(k-n) for n <= k <= 2n-1. In the limit as n tends to infinity the n_nacci sequence after an initial large set of zeros followed by 1 has successive terms of ascending powers of 2. The sequence 2^n with n starting at 0 is, lexicologically, the most minimal "complete" (sic) sequence. Consequently for each n_nacci sequence there must be a largest k such that n_nacci(k) >= 2^(k-n-1). (End)

%F A202805 a(n) = greatest k such that n_nacci(k) >= 2^(k-n-1).
%e A202805 For n=3, the tribonacci sequence is 0,0,1,1,2,4,7,...,149,274,504,... and the 13th term is 504 < 512 so a(n)=12 because 274 is greatest term >= 2^(12-3-1) = 256.
