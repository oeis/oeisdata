%N A202319 Lesser of two semiprimes sandwiched each between semiprimes thus forming a twin semiprime-triple.
%C A202319 Conjecture: For every natural number k there are infinitely many semiprime pairs sp and sp' both sandwiched between semiprimes such that sp' - sp = 4k.
%C A202319 Note: For the case k=1 the pair of two consecutive semiprime triples will be called twin semiprime-triple with an analogy to twin prime.
%C A202319 The number centered between the triples of a twin semiprime-triple must be divisible by 36. Let m be the middle of such a twin semiprime-triple. It is trivial that m is divisible by 4, and that it is congruent to 0, 4, or 5 (mod 9). If it were congruent to 4, then m-1 and m+2 would both be divisible by 3, hence equal to 3 times a prime. But then those two primes would differ by 1, impossible except for primes 2, 3, which can be checked separately. A similar argument eliminates the case m == 5 (mod 9), so m must be divisible by 9. Conjecture by the author, proved by _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Dec 18 2011.
%C A202319 Members of this sequence must be twice the lesser of a twin prime. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Dec 18 2011
%C A202319 A number is in the sequence if and only if it has the form 6k-2, with 2k+-1 being twin primes, 3k+-1 twin primes, and 6k+-1 semiprimes. - _Peter Munn_, Oct 28 2017
%C A202319 By arguments similar to the above proof that m = a(n)+2 is divisible by 36, it can be shown that (a(n)+2)/36 == {-1, 0, 1} (mod 5) == {-1, 0, 1} (mod 7) and that a(n) == {214, 502, 538, 718, 754, 1042, 1258} (mod 1260). - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Feb 26 2022
