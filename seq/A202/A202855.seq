%N A202855 Numbers k such that phi(k) - 1 divides k, where phi is Euler's totient function.
%C A202855 The sequence b(n) = 4*A050474(n) is a subsequence of this sequence, and comprises solutions of n/(phi(n) - 1) = 4, accounting for all terms up to a(9) except a(1) and a(3). Proof: suppose n/(phi(n) - 1) = 4. With n = 4*x, x/(phi(4*x) - 1) = 1, or phi(4*x) = x + 1. Since phi(k) is even for k > 2, x is odd, and phi(4*x) = 2*phi(x) = x + 1, the definition of A050474. It follows that 4*A050474(8) = 27971850688528380 is a term of this sequence. - _Chris Boyd_, Mar 22 2015
%C A202855 Similarly, the terms with n/(phi(n) - 1) = 3 are given by 3 * terms of A050474 coprime to 3; n/(phi(n) - 1) = 6 are given by 6 * terms of A050474 coprime to 6. Also, the terms of n/(phi(n) - 1) = 5 are given by 5 * terms t of A203966 coprime to 5 and having (t+1)/phi(t) = 4. Note that n/(phi(n) - 1) = 2 is impossible. - _Max Alekseyev_, Oct 26 2023
