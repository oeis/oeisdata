%N A239439 Smallest number between consecutive odd primes whose sum of prime factors is a minimum.
%C A239439 The prime factors are counted with multiplicity, as in A001414.

%e A239439 For n = 1, the 1st and 2nd odd prime numbers are 3 and 5. 4 is the only number between them. So a(1) = 4;
%e A239439 ...
%e A239439 For n = 10, the 10th and 11th odd prime numbers are 31 and 37. Testing from 32 to 36:
%e A239439   32 = 2^5, sum of prime factors = 2*5 = 10;
%e A239439   33 = 3*11, sum of prime factors = 3+11 = 14;
%e A239439   34 = 2*17, sum of prime factors = 2+17 = 19;
%e A239439   35 = 5*7, sum of prime factors = 5+7 = 12;
%e A239439   36 = 2^2*3^2, sum of prime factors = 2*2+3*2 = 10;
%e A239439 32 and 36 have the minimum sum of prime factors, i.e., 10, and 32 is the smaller number of the two.  So a(10) = 32.
