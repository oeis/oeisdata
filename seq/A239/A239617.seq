%N A239617 Number of ways to write 2*n = p + q with p, q and pi(2*p) - pi(p) all prime, where pi(x) denotes the number of primes not exceeding x.
%C A239617 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 4.
%C A239617 (ii) Each integer n > 5 can be written as p + q (q > 0) with p and pi(2*q) - pi(q) both prime.
%C A239617 (iii) Any integer n > 2 not equal to 11 can be written as p + q with p prime and pi(2*q) - pi(q) a square.
%C A239617 Part (i) is a refinement of Goldbach's conjecture. It implies that there are infinitely many primes p with pi(2*p) - pi(p) prime.
