%N A239738 Normal distributions from the primes. The contracted sequence of integers generated from the frequencies of the summation of elements of the subsets of the Cartesian product of the natural numbers of ascending prime cardinality. that is, given a number of sets of the natural numbers of ascending modulo P(n+1), the probabilities of generating a given number from the selection of one element from each set form the given sequence.
%C A239738 Although this sequence initially appears similar to A131791, its derivation is entirely different and it deviates quickly.
%C A239738 By sets of natural numbers of ascending prime cardinality, it is meant
%C A239738 {N_1} = {1,2}, {N_2} = {1,2,3}, {N_3} = {1,2,3,4,5}, {N_4} = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} ,..., {N_w} = [1,2,3,...,p_w] , p ∈ {P}
%C A239738 with Cartesian products
%C A239738 {N_1} X {N_2} = {1,2} X {1,2,3} = {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3))}, etc.
%C A239738 and the sum of the elements of the product's subsets denoted
%C A239738 Sum[{N_1} X {N_2}] = {(2),(3),(4),(3),(4),(5)}
%C A239738 whose elements have the frequencies [1,2,2,1] (with respect to magnitude). It is these frequencies that form the sequence, the symmetry allows for the omission of repeated terms, and hence the following contraction halves the data without loss of information:
%C A239738   [1,1] -> [1]
%C A239738   [1,2,2,1] -> [1,2]
%C A239738   [1,3,5,6,6,5,3,1] -> [1,3,5,6]
%C A239738 and so forth.
%C A239738 When arranged by row of the number of sets used, then P(S_{u,r} = u + r - 1) = a_{u,r}/Product p_r
%C A239738 where the a_{u,r} denotes the u-th element of row r, P(S = X) the probability that the sum S equals the value X, and Product p_r is the product of the first r primes, then the structure and symmetry become more apparent.

%C A239738 where each row contains 𝓁ᵣ = (1/2)*(∑pᵣ - r + 1) terms and clearly the sum of each row must equal half the product of the primes used,
%C A239738   ∑aᵤ,ᵣ = (1/2)*∏pᵣ. [1 <= u <= 𝓁ᵣ]
%C A239738 and one can see that in general
%C A239738   for all u, r, P(Sᵤ,ᵣ = r) = P(Sᵤ,ᵣ = ∑pᵣ) = 1/∏pᵣ
%C A239738   P(Sᵤ,ᵣ = r + 1) = P(Sᵤ,ᵣ = ∑pᵣ - 1) = r/∏pᵣ
%C A239738   P(S = r + i) = P(S = ∑pᵣ - i) = a(u+i,r)/∏pᵣ, [0 <= i <= 𝓁ᵣ - 1)]
