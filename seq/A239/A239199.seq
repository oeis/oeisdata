%N A239199 Expansion of Pi in the irrational base b=sqrt(3).
%C A239199 The negative offset is chosen as to have Pi = sum(a(i)*b^-i, i=offset...+oo), with the base b=sqrt(3), cf. Example.
%C A239199 Sqrt(3) is the largest base of the form sqrt(n) < 2, such that the expansion of any number in this base has only digits 1 and 0 (which allows a condensed version of the expansion which lists only the positions of the nonzero digits, here: -2, 4, 7, 9, 12, 14, 17, 18, 24, 26, ...). Log(7) has this maximal property for bases of the form log(n).
