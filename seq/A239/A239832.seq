%N A239832 Number of partitions of n having 1 more even part than odd, so that there is an ordering of parts for which the even and odd parts alternate and the first and last terms are even.
%C A239832 Let c(n) be the number of partitions of n having 1 more odd part than even, so that there is an ordering of parts for which the even and odd parts alternate and the first and last terms are odd.  Then c(n) = a(n+1) for n >= 0.
