%N A239721 Numbers that end in (..., 175, 175, 175, ...) under the rule: next term = product of the last four digits in the sequence so far.
%C A239721 Additional rule: If there are fewer than k=4 digits so far, then the sequence is "extended to the left" with the first digit. (It might have been more natural to "extend" with digits 1, i.e., to reduce k to the number of digits if there are less than 4.)
%C A239721 Apart from the trivial cycles (0) and (1) and the cycle (175) considered here, the rule also allows for the "constant" cycle (384), cf. A239722, and (128), cf. A240967.
%C A239721 In general, such "constant" cycles for k=4 (other than the trivial (0) and (1)) must consist of a 3-digit number (100a+10b+c), a,b,c>0, such that a = (10b+c)/(b*c^2-100). The only solutions are:  a=1, b=2, c=8;  a=1, b=7, c=5;  a=3, b=8, c=4. - _Bob Selcoe_, Aug 04 2014
%H A239721 E. Angelini, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://list.seqfan.eu/oldermail/seqfan/2014-August/013413.html">Multiplication by themselves of the last k digits</a>.
%e A239721 For a(1)=53, the sequence is 53,375,315,75,175,175,175,..., since 5*5*5*3 = 375, 3*3*7*5 = 315, 5*3*1*5 = 75, 1*5*7*5 = 175, etc.
%o A239721 (PARI) is_A239721(n) = A238984(99, n, 4)==175  \\ Here, the somewhat arbitrary value 99 (number of iterations before checking whether 175 is reached) should be sufficiently large for small n, but might need to be increased for larger starting values n.
