%N A198338 Irregular triangle read by rows: row n is the sequence of Matula numbers of the rooted subtrees of the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number n. A root subtree of a rooted tree T is a subtree of T containing the root.
%C A198338 The Matula-Goebel number of a rooted tree can be defined in the following recursive manner: to the one-vertex tree there corresponds the number 1; to a tree T with root degree 1 there corresponds the t-th prime number, where t is the Matula-Goebel number of the tree obtained from T by deleting the edge emanating from the root; to a tree T with root degree m>=2 there corresponds the product of the Matula-Goebel numbers of the m branches of T.
%C A198338 Number of entries in row n is A184160(n). Row n>=2 can be easily identified: it starts with the entry following the first occurrence of n-1 and it ends with the first occurrence of n.

%F A198338 Row 1 is [1]; if n = p(t) (= the t-th prime), then row n is [1, p(a), p(b), ... ], where [a,b,...] is row t; if n=rs (r,s >=2), then row n consists of the numbers r[i]*s[j], where [r[1], r[2],...] is row r and [s[1], s[2], ...] is row s. The Maple program, based on this recursive procedure, yields row n (<=1000; adjustable) with the command MRST(n).
%e A198338 Row 4 is [1,2,2,4] because the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number 4 is V and its root subtrees are *, |, |, and V.
