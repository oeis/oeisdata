%N A198512 Half the difference between an odd squarefree semiprime's factors.
%C A198512 It is trivially easy to factor small semiprimes, even with trial division. But larger semiprimes can pose quite a challenge. Behrends (2008) gives a method cryptanalysts can use to factor a large semiprime that can work reasonably well if the prime factors, even if also very large, can be figured out if they are not spaced too far apart. The method exploits the following fact about odd semiprimes:
%C A198512 The square of half the difference between the prime factors, when added to the semiprime, gives a perfect square. The square root of that perfect square is halfway between the two prime factors of the semiprime. For example: 39 = 3 * 13, 13 - 3 = 10, 10/2 = 5, 39 + 5^2 = 64, sqrt(64) = 8, and lastly 8 - 5 = 3 and 8 + 5 = 13.
%C A198512 The method then is to add perfect squares to a suspected semiprime until finding another perfect square. In turn, cryptographers should choose large semiprimes with widely distant prime factors.
%C A198512 If de Polignac's conjecture is true then every positive integer occurs infinitely many times in this sequence. For example, a(n) = 1 for n = 1, 4, 24, 60, 147,..., as these numbers give the positions of twin primes (p, p+2) in the sequence (p,q) where p<q and p*q ranges through the products p*q of odd primes as in A046388. - _Clark Kimberling_, Jan 21 2026
