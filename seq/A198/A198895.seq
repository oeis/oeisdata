%C A198895 The recurrence about T(n, k) and the equation that connects T(n, k) to P(n, k) = A059427(n,k), which are given below, appear on p. 159 of the book by David and Barton (1962). The initial conditions, however, for their triangular array S^*_{N,t} are slightly different, but there is an agreement starting at t = k = 1. They do not provide tables for S^*_{N,t} (that matches the current array T(n, k) for N = n >= 0 and t = k >= 1).
%C A198895 Despite the slightly different initial conditions between T(n, k) and S^*_{N,t} (from p. 159 in the book), the recurrence given below can be proved very easily from the recurrence for the row polynomials R_n(x) given in Shi-Mei Ma (2011, 2012). (End)

%F A198895 n-th row represents the coefficients of the polynomial R_n(x) defined by the recurrence: R_0(x) = 1, R_1(x) = 1 + x, and for n >= 1, R_{n+1}(x) = (1 + n*x^2)*R_n(x) + x*(1 - x^2)*R'_n(x).

%F A198895 T(n, k) = (k + 1) * T(n-1, k) + (n - k + 1) * T(n-1, k-2) for n >= 0 and 2 <= k <= n with initial conditions T(n, k=0) = 1 for n >= 0, T(n, k=1) = 2^(n-1) for n >= 1, and T(n, k) = 0 for n < 0 or n < k.
%F A198895 Setting x = 1 in the equation R_{n+1}(x) = (1 + n*x^2)*R_n(x) + x*(1 - x^2)*R'_n(x) (valid for n >= 1), we get R_{n+1}(1) = (n + 1)*R_n(1) for n >= 1. Since R_1(1) = 2, we have that R_n(1) = 2*n! for n >= 1. Since also R_0(1) = 1, we conclude that Sum_{k = 0..n} T(n,k) = R_n(1) = 2*n! - 0^n = A098558(n) for n >= 0.
%F A198895 Let P(n, k) = A059427(n,k) with P(n, k) = 0 for n <= 1 or n <= k. Then T(n, k) = (1/2)*P(n, k-1) + P(n, k) + (1/2) * P(n, k+1) for n >= 2 and 0 <= k <= n (but this is not true for n = 0 and n = 1). (End)
