%N A198323 Matula-Goebel number of rooted trees that have only vertices of degree 1 and of maximal degree.
%C A198323 The Matula-Goebel number of a rooted tree can be defined in the following recursive manner: to the one-vertex tree there corresponds the number 1; to a tree T with root degree 1 there corresponds the t-th prime number, where t is the Matula-Goebel number of the tree obtained from T by deleting the edge emanating from the root; to a tree T with root degree m>=2 there corresponds the product of the Matula-Goebel numbers of the m branches of T.

%F A198323 In A182907 one can find the generating polynomial g(n,x) of the vertices of the rooted tree having Matula-Goebel number n, according to degree. We look for those values of n for which the polynomial g(n) = g(n,x) has at most 2 terms.
%e A198323 7 is in the sequence because the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number 7 is the rooted tree Y, having 3 vertices of degree 1 and 1 vertex of degree 3.
%e A198323 15, 22, and 31 are in the sequence because the corresponding rooted trees are path trees on 6 vertices (with different roots); they have 2 vertices of degree 1 and 4 vertices of degree 2.
