%N A198684 Mixed palindromic van der Waerden numbers pdw(n,3;2)_1 ("satisfiable" part).
%C A198684 The largest number M such that for all natural numbers 1 <= m <= M there exists a partitioning of {1,...,m} into 2 parts such that the first part contains no arithmetic progression of length 3, and the second part contains no arithmetic progression of size n, and such that the partitioning is palindromic, that is, written as 0-1 string is a palindrome (reading the same from both sides). So trivially pdw(1,3;2)=2 and pdw(2,3;2)=3.
%C A198684 pdw(n,3;2) is a pair of natural numbers, where the second part (the "unsatisfiable part") is given by A198685.

%e A198684 For n=3 we have pdw(3,3;2)_1=6, because ({1,2,5,6},{3,4}) is a palindromic partitioning of {1,...,6} into two parts such that no part contains an arithmetic progression of size 3, while {1,...,7} has no such *palindromic* partitioning (though it has a nonpalindromic partitioning by w(3,3;2)=9), since one of the parts needs to contain the midpoint 4 and thus cannot contain any other number (by palindromicity we would get an arithmetic progression of size 3).
