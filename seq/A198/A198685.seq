%N A198685 Mixed palindromic van der Waerden numbers pdw(n,3;2)_2 ("unsatisfiable" part).
%C A198685 The smallest number M such that for all natural numbers m >= M there exists no partitioning of {1,...,m} into 2 parts such that the first part contains no arithmetic progression of length 3, and the second part contains no arithmetic progression of size n, and such that the partitioning is palindromic, that is, written as 0-1 string is a palindrome (reading the same from both sides). So pdw(1,3;2)_2=3 and pdw(2,3;2)_2=6.
%C A198685 pdw(n,3;2) is a pair of natural numbers, where the first part (the "satisfiable part") is given by A198684.
%C A198685 pdw(n,3;2) is the palindromic version of w(n,3;2) which is A007783.

%e A198685 pdw(3,3;2)_2=9, since ({2,4,5,7},{1,3,6,8}) is a palindromic partitioning of {1,...,8} such that no part contains an arithmetic progression of length 3, while there is no such a partitioning of {1,...,9} because of w(3,3;2)=9.
%Y A198685 Cf. A007783.
