%N A091766 For n > 2, let m be the least number that cannot be expressed as a(i), a(i)+a(j), or a(i)-a(j) with i, j < n. Then a(n) = a(n-1)+m.
%C A091766 This can be treated as sequence of weights, one each of distinct denominations, so that any value of weight r units can be measured using at most two weights placing them in either side of the balance. E.g., 19 = 25 - 6 = a(5) - a(3).
%C A091766 n = x*a(k) + y*a(m), where x and y can take values -1, 0 or 1, has a solution. Sequence A000244 gives sequence of weights with no restriction on the number of weights.
%F A091766 For n > 2, a(n) = a(n-1) + A091767(n-1) + 1. - _David Wasserman_, Apr 24 2006
%e A091766 Using first three terms 1,2 and 6 all numbers up to 8 can be obtained in this manner. (1), (2), (3=1+2), (4= 6-2), (5=6-1), (6), (7=6+1), (8=6+2) hence a(4) = 15 and 9 = 15-6.
