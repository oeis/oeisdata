%N A091509 Numbers (in ascending order, without multiplicity) which occur in triples a,b,c such that a < b < c, (b * c) / (b + c) leaves a, (a * c) / (a + c) leaves b and (a * b) / (a + b) leaves c as a remainder.
%C A091509 First, second and third component of the triples are resp. in A092817, A092818, A092819. 5, 7 and 11 (forming the first triple) seem to be the only primes in the sequence. The greatest common divisor of the triples is in A092864. Some numbers occur in two (111, 475, 864, 931), some in three (575, 3015, 3200, 3311) triples. It is easy to prove that a triple has either only odd or only even components.
%C A091509 By means of the PARI program 337 triples (sum of first and second component < 20000) were computed, comprising 925 different terms. The 86th triple is the last one of these which has a first component < 1000, so it is almost certain that no terms are missing in the list given above. But to prove this one has to find a lower bound for the first component of the k-th triple.
%e A091509 5, 7 and 11 form a triple because (7 * 11) / (7 + 11) = 77/18 leaves 5, (5 * 11) / (5 + 11) = 55/16 leaves 7 and (5 * 7) / (5 + 7) = 35/12 leaves 11 as a remainder, hence 11 (as well as 5 and 7) is a term.
