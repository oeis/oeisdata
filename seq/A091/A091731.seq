%N A091731 Number of irreducible elements of Z[sqrt(-5)] of norm n (counting a and -a once only).

%C A091731 Note that a is irreducible if and only if (a) is either a prime ideal of the product of two (not necessarily distinct) non-principal prime ideals; the same applies in every quadratic field whose class group has exponent 2. We have:
%C A091731  - {N(P) : P principal prime ideal} = {5} U {p : p prime == 1, 9 (mod 20)} U {p^2 : p prime == 11, 13, 17, 19 (mod 20)}. There are two prime ideals with norm p for each prime p == 1, 9 (mod 20), and only one with norm 5 or p^2;
%C A091731  - {N(P) : P non-principal prime ideal} = {2} U {p : p prime == 3, 7 (mod 20)}. There are two prime ideals with norm p for each prime p == 3, 7 (mod 20), and only one with norm 2.
%C A091731 As a result:
%C A091731  - a(4) = a(5) = a(p^2) = 1 for primes p == 11, 13, 17, 19 (mod 20);
%C A091731  - a(p) = 2 for primes p == 1, 9 (mod 20);
%C A091731  - a(2*p) = 2 for primes p == 3, 7 (mod 20);
%C A091731  - a(p^2) = 3 for primes p == 3, 7 (mod 20);
%C A091731  - a(p*q) = 4 for distinct primes p == 3, 7 (mod 20);
%C A091731  - a(n) = 0 for every other n.
