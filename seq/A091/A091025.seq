%N A091025 Smallest positive k such that phi(1+k*2^m) <= phi(k*2^m) for all m = n (mod 12), where phi is Euler's totient function.
%C A091025 This sequence shows why A090849 has only a small number of distinct terms. It can be shown that 1+a(n) 2^m has factors of 3, 5 and 7 for all m = n (mod 12). Using that fact and the fact that (1-1/3)*(1-1/5)*(1-1/7) < 1/2, it is easy to verify that phi(1+k*2^m) <= phi(k*2^m) for all m = n (mod 12). Note that each successive term can be obtained by dividing by 2 (mod 105).
