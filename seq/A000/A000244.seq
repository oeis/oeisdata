%C A000244 Explanation from _David Applegate_, Feb 20 2017: (Start)
%C A000244 Since the preceding comment appears in a large number of sequences, it might be worth adding a proof.
%C A000244 The number of compositions of n into exactly k parts is binomial(n-1,k-1).
%C A000244 For a p-colored composition of n such that no adjacent parts have the same color, there are exactly p choices for the color of the first part, and p-1 choices for the color of each additional part (any color other than the color of the previous one). So, for a partition into k parts, there are p (p-1)^(k-1) valid colorings.
%C A000244 Thus the number of p-colored compositions of n into exactly k parts such that no adjacent parts have the same color is binomial(n-1,k-1) p (p-1)^(k-1).
%C A000244 The total number of p-colored compositions of n such that no adjacent parts have the same color is then
%C A000244 Sum_{k=1..n} binomial(n-1,k-1) * p * (p-1)^(k-1) = p^n.
%C A000244 To see this, note that the binomial expansion of ((p - 1) + 1)^(n - 1) = Sum_{k = 0..n - 1} binomial(n - 1, k) (p - 1)^k 1^(n - 1 - k) = Sum_{k = 1..n} binomial(n - 1, k - 1) (p - 1)^(k - 1).

%C A000244 a(n) = A007051(n+1) - A007051(n), and A007051 are the antidiagonal sums of an array defined by m(0,k) = 1 and m(n,k) = Sum_{c = 0..k - 1} m(n, c) + Sum_{r = 0..n - 1} m(r, k), which is the sum of the terms to left of m(n, k) plus those above m(n, k). m(1, k) = A000079(k); m(2, k) = A045623(k + 1); m(k + 1, k) = A084771(k). - _J. M. Bergot_, Jul 16 2013

Row n = 0 of the array comprises A000079, column k = 0 comprises A011782, row n = 1 comprises A001792. Antidiagonal sums of the array are a(n): 1 = 3^0, 1 + 2 = 3^1, 2 + 3 + 4 = 3^2, 4 + 7 + 8 + 8 = 3^3. - _J. M. Bergot_, Aug 02 2013
%C A000244 The sequence with interspersed zeros and o.g.f. x/(1 - 3*x^2), A(2*k) = 0, A(2*k + 1) = 3^k = a(k), k >= 0, can be called hexagon numbers. This is because the algebraic number rho(6) = 2*cos(Pi/6) = sqrt(3) of degree 2, with minimal polynomial C(6, x) = x^2 - 3 (see A187360, n = 6), is the length ratio of the smaller diagonal and the side in the hexagon. Hence rho(6)^n = A(n-1)*1 + A(n)*rho(6), in the power basis of the quadratic number field Q(rho(6)). One needs also A(-1) = 1. See also a Dec 02 2010 comment and the P. Steinbach reference given in A049310. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Oct 02 2013

%C A000244 All powers of 3 are perfect totient numbers (A082897), since phi(3^n) = 2 * 3^(n - 1) for n > 0, and thus Sum_{i = 0..n} phi(3^i) = 3^n. - _Alonso del Arte_, Apr 20 2014
%C A000244 The least number k > 0 such that 3^k ends in n consecutive decreasing digits is a 3-term sequence given by {1, 13, 93}. The consecutive increasing digits are {3, 23, 123}. There are 100 different 3-digit endings for 3^k. There are no k-values such that 3^k ends in '012', '234', '345', '456', '567', '678', or '789'. The k-values for which 3^k ends in '123' are given by 93 mod 100. For k = 93 + 100*x, the digit immediately before the run of '123' is {9, 5, 1, 7, 3, 9, 5, 1, 3, 7, ...} for x = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, ...}, respectively. Thus we see the digit before '123' will never be a 0. So there are no further terms. - _Derek Orr_, Jul 03 2014

For example, the 0-dimensional hypercube is a point, and its only face is itself. The 1-dimensional hypercube is a line, which has two vertices and an edge. The 2-dimensional hypercube is a square, which has four vertices, four edges, and a square face. - _Kevin Long_, Mar 14 2023
%C A000244 Number of pairs (A,B) of subsets of M={1,2,...,n} with union(A,B)=M. For nonempty subsets cf. A058481. - _Manfred Boergens_, Mar 28 2023
%C A000244 From _Jianing Song_, Sep 27 2023: (Start)
%C A000244 a(n) is the number of disjunctive clauses of n variables up to equivalence. A disjunctive clause is a propositional formula of the form l_1 OR ... OR l_m, where l_1, ..., l_m are distinct elements in {x_1, ..., x_n, NOT x_1, ..., NOT x_n} for n variables x_1, ... x_n, and no x_i and NOT x_i appear at the same time. For each 1 <= i <= n, we can have neither of x_i or NOT x_i, only x_i or only NOT x_i appearing in a disjunctive clause, so the number of such clauses is 3^n. Viewing the propositional formulas of n variables as functions {0,1}^n -> {0,1}, a disjunctive clause corresponds to a function f such that the inverse image of 0 is of the form A_1 X ... X A_n, where A_i is nonempty for all 1 <= i <= n. Since each A_i has 3 choices ({0}, {1} or {0,1}), we also find that the number of disjunctive clauses of n variables is 3^n.
%C A000244 Equivalently, a(n) is the number of conjunctive clauses of n variables. (End)
%C A000244 The finite subsequence a(2), a(3), a(4), a(5) = 9, 27, 81, 243 is one of only two geometric sequences that can be formed with all interior angles (all integer, in degrees) of a simple polygon. The other sequence is a subsequence of A007283 (see comment there). - _Felix Huber_, Feb 15 2024
