%N A000108 Catalan numbers: C(n) = binomial(2n,n)/(n+1) = (2n)!/(n!(n+1)!).
%C A000108 These were formerly sometimes called Segner numbers.
%C A000108 A very large number of combinatorial interpretations are known - see references, esp. R. P. Stanley, "Catalan Numbers", Cambridge University Press, 2015. This is probably the longest entry in the OEIS, and rightly so.
%C A000108 The solution to Schröder's first problem: number of ways to insert n pairs of parentheses in a word of n+1 letters. E.g., for n=2 there are 2 ways: ((ab)c) or (a(bc)); for n=3 there are 5 ways: ((ab)(cd)), (((ab)c)d), ((a(bc))d), (a((bc)d)), (a(b(cd))).
%C A000108 Consider all the binomial(2n,n) paths on squared paper that (i) start at (0, 0), (ii) end at (2n, 0) and (iii) at each step, either make a (+1,+1) step or a (+1,-1) step. Then the number of such paths that never go below the x-axis (Dyck paths) is C(n). [Chung-Feller]
%C A000108 Number of noncrossing partitions of the n-set. For example, of the 15 set partitions of the 4-set, only [{13},{24}] is crossing, so there are a(4)=14 noncrossing partitions of 4 elements. - _Joerg Arndt_, Jul 11 2011

%C A000108 The multiplicity with which a prime p divides C_n can be determined by first expressing n+1 in base p. For p=2, the multiplicity is the number of 1 digits minus 1. For p an odd prime, count all digits greater than (p+1)/2; also count digits equal to (p+1)/2 unless final; and count digits equal to (p-1)/2 if not final and the next digit is counted. For example, n=62, n+1 = 223_5, so C_62 is not divisible by 5. n=63, n+1 = 224_5, so 5^3 | C_63. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Feb 08 2006
%C A000108 Koshy and Salmassi give an elementary proof that the only prime Catalan numbers are a(2) = 2 and a(3) = 5. Is the only semiprime Catalan number a(4) = 14? - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Mar 06 2006
%C A000108 The answer is yes. Using the formula C_n = binomial(2n,n)/(n+1), it is immediately clear that C_n can have no prime factor greater than 2n. For n >= 7, C_n > (2n)^2, so it cannot be a semiprime. Given that the Catalan numbers grow exponentially, the above consideration implies that the number of prime divisors of C_n, counted with multiplicity, must grow without limit. The number of distinct prime divisors must also grow without limit, but this is more difficult. Any prime between n+1 and 2n (exclusive) must divide C_n. That the number of such primes grows without limit follows from the prime number theorem. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Apr 14 2006
%C A000108 The number of ways to place n indistinguishable balls in n numbered boxes B1,...,Bn such that at most a total of k balls are placed in boxes B1,...,Bk for k=1,...,n.

The Grassmannian is considered a subset of N-dimensional projective space, N = binomial(n+2,2) - 1. If we choose 2n general (n-1)-planes in projective (n+1)-space, then there are C(n) lines that meet all of them. - Benji Fisher (benji(AT)FisherFam.org), Mar 05 2009

%C A000108 Consider a set of A000217(n) balls of n colors in which, for each integer k = 1 to n, exactly one color appears in the set a total of k times. (Each ball has exactly one color and is indistinguishable from other balls of the same color.) a(n+1) equals the number of ways to choose 0 or more balls of each color while satisfying the following conditions: 1.

%C A000108 Named by Riordan (1968, and earlier in Mathematical Reviews, 1948 and 1964) after the French and Belgian mathematician Eugène Charles Catalan (1814-1894) (see Pak, 2014). - _Amiram Eldar_, Apr 15 2021
%C A000108 For n >= 1, a(n-1) is the number of interpretations of x^n is an algebra where power-associativity is not assumed. For example, for n = 4 there are a(3) = 5 interpretations: x(x(xx)), x((xx)x), (xx)(xx), (x(xx))x, ((xx)x)x. See the link "Non-associate powers and a functional equation" from I. M. H. Etherington and the page "Nonassociative Product" from Eric Weisstein's World of Mathematics for detailed information. See also A001190 for the case where multiplication is commutative. - _Jianing Song_, Apr 29 2022
%C A000108 Number of states in the transition diagram associated with the Laplacian system over the complete graph K_N, corresponding to ordered initial conditions x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_N. - _Andrea Arlette España_, Nov 06 2022
%C A000108 a(n) is the number of 132-avoiding stabilized-interval-free permutations of size n+1. - _Juan B. Gil_, Jun 22 2023
%C A000108 Number of rooted polyominoes composed of n triangular cells of the hyperbolic regular tiling with Schläfli symbol {3,oo}. A rooted polyomino has one external edge identified, and chiral pairs are counted as two. A stereographic projection of the {3,oo} tiling on the Poincaré disk can be obtained via the Christersson link. - _Robert A. Russell_, Jan 27 2024
%C A000108 a(n) is the number of extremely lucky Stirling permutations of order n; i.e., the number of Stirling permutations of order n that have exactly n lucky cars. (see Colmenarejo et al. reference) - _Bridget Tenner_, Apr 16 2024
%C A000108 Catalan numbers can be calculated with Theta(n(log n)^2) bit complexity through the utilization of Legendre's formula to determine the prime factorization and reconstruction of the final integer using a balanced product tree. See Ramani link for more details. C(2050572903) was calculated this way. - _Mahesh Ramani_, Nov 23 2025
