%C A000292 We consider optimal proper vertex colorings of a graph G. Assume that the labeling, i.e., coloring starts with 1.

Let S=Sum of the differences |l(v) - l(u)|, the sum being over all edges uv of G and l(w) is the label associated with a vertex w of G. We say G admits unique labeling if all possible labelings of G is S-invariant and yields the same integer partition of S.

%C A000292 The third Euler row (1,4,1) has an additional connection with the tetrahedral numbers besides the n^3 identity stated above: a^2(n) + 4*a^2(n+1) + a^2(n+2) = a(n^2+4n+4), which can be shown with algebra. E.g., a^2(2) + 4*a^2(3) + a^2(4) = 16 + 400 + 400 = a(16).
