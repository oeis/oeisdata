%N A000124 Central polygonal numbers (the Lazy Caterer's sequence): n(n+1)/2 + 1; or, maximal number of pieces formed when slicing a pancake with n cuts.
%C A000124 These are Hogben's central polygonal numbers with the (two-dimensional) symbol
%C A000124 2
%C A000124 .P
%C A000124 1 n
%C A000124 The first line cuts the pancake into 2 pieces. For n > 1, the n-th line crosses every earlier line (avoids parallelism) and also avoids every previous line intersection, thus increasing the number of pieces by n. For 16 lines, for example, the number of pieces is 2 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + ... + 16 = 137. These are the triangular numbers plus 1 (cf. A000217).
%C A000124 m = (n-1)(n-2)/2 + 1 is also the smallest number of edges such that all graphs with n nodes and m edges are connected. - _Keith Briggs_, May 14 2004
%C A000124 Also maximal number of grandchildren of a binary vector of length n+2. E.g., a binary vector of length 6 can produce at most 11 different vectors when 2 bits are deleted.
%C A000124 This is also the order dimension of the (strong) Bruhat order on the finite Coxeter group B_{n+1}. - Nathan Reading (reading(AT)math.umn.edu), Mar 07 2002
%C A000124 Number of 132- and 321-avoiding permutations of {1,2,...,n+1}. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Mar 14 2002

%C A000124 Also the number of terms in (1)(x+1)(x^2+x+1)...(x^n+...+x+1); see A000140.
%C A000124 Narayana transform (analog of the binomial transform) of vector [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, ...] = A000124; using the infinite lower Narayana triangle of A001263 (as a matrix), N; then N * [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, ...] = A000124. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Apr 28 2005
%C A000124 Number of interval subsets of {1, 2, 3, ..., n} (cf. A002662). - Jose Luis Arregui (arregui(AT)unizar.es), Jun 27 2006
%C A000124 Define a number of straight lines in the plane to be in general arrangement when (1) no two lines are parallel, (2) there is no point common to three lines. Then these are the maximal numbers of regions defined by n straight lines in general arrangement in the plane. - Peter C. Heinig (algorithms(AT)gmx.de), Oct 19 2006
%C A000124 Note that a(n) = a(n-1) + A000027(n-1). This has the following geometrical interpretation: Suppose there are already n-1 lines in general arrangement, thus defining the maximal number of regions in the plane obtainable by n-1 lines and now one more line is added in general arrangement. Then it will cut each of the n-1 lines and acquire intersection points which are in general arrangement. (See the comments on A000027 for general arrangement with points.) These points on the new line define the maximal number of regions in 1-space definable by n-1 points, hence this is A000027(n-1), where for A000027 an offset of 0 is assumed, that is, A000027(n-1) = (n+1)-1 = n. Each of these regions acts as a dividing wall, thereby creating as many new regions in addition to the a(n-1) regions already there, hence a(n) = a(n-1) + A000027(n-1). Cf. the comments on A000125 for an analogous interpretation. - Peter C. Heinig (algorithms(AT)gmx.de), Oct 19 2006
%C A000124 When constructing a zonohedron, one zone at a time, out of (up to) 3-d non-intersecting parallelepipeds, the n-th element of this sequence is the number of edges in the n-th zone added with the n-th "layer" of parallelepipeds. (Verified up to 10-zone zonohedron, the enneacontahedron.) E.g., adding the 10th zone to the enneacontahedron requires 46 parallel edges (edges in the 10th zone) by looking directly at a 5-valence vertex and counting visible vertices. - _Shel Kaphan_, Feb 16 2006
