%N A000789 Maximal order of a triangle-free cyclic graph with no independent set of size n.
%C A000789 Previous name was: Ramsey numbers.
%C A000789 The sequence may be considered as consisting of a special kind of Ramsey numbers. It is related to the ordinary two-color Ramsey numbers R(3,n), given in A000791, by the relation a(n) <= A000791(n)-1 as proved by Kalbfleisch. He also calculated the first eight terms, and noted that the inequality sometimes is strict. The first n for which this happens is n=6.
%C A000789 The terms a(10), a(11) and a(12) were calculated by Harborth and Krause. - _Jörgen Backelin_, Jan 07 2016

%e A000789 That a(6) >= 16 is seen from the cyclic (or circulant) graph on 16 vertices, with edges between vertices of index distances 1, 3, or 8, since this cyclic graph indeed is triangle-free and has independence number five, which is less than six.
%e A000789 On the other hand, a(6) < 17, since any triangle free graph with independence number less than six and at least 17 vertices has exactly 17 vertices and cannot be regular, but all cyclic graphs are regular.
%e A000789 Thus, indeed, a(6) = 16.
