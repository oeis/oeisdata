%C A000975 Popular puzzles such as Spin-Out and The Brain Puzzler are based on the Gray binary system and require a(n) steps to complete for some number n.
%C A000975 Conjecture: {a(n)} also gives all j for which A048702(j) = A000217(j); i.e., if we take the a(n)-th triangular number (a(n)^2 + a(n))/2 and multiply it by 3, we get a(n)-th even-length binary palindrome A048701(a(n)) concatenated from a(n) and its reverse. E.g., a(4) = 10, which is 1010 in binary; the tenth triangular number is 55, and 55*3 = 165 = 10100101 in binary. - _Antti Karttunen_, circa 1999. (This has been now proved by Paul K.

%C A000975 1) Denote by {n, k} the number of permutations of 1, ..., n with the up-down index k (for definition, see comment in A203827). Then max_k{n, k} = {n, a(n)} = A000111(n).

%C A000975 From _Hieronymus Fischer_, Nov 22 2012: (Start)
%C A000975 Represented in binary form each term after the second one contains every previous term as a substring.
%C A000975 The terms a(2) = 2 and a(3) = 5 are the only primes. Proof: For even n we get a(n) = 2*(2^(2*n) - 1)/3, which shows that a(n) is even, too, and obviously a(n) > 2 for all even n > 2. For odd n we have a(n) = (2^(n+1) - 1)/3 = (2^((n+1)/2) - 1) * (2^((n+1)/2) + 1)/3. Evidently, at least one of these factors is divisible by 3, both are greater than 6, provided n > 3. Hence it follows that a(n) is composite for all odd n > 3.
%C A000975 Represented as a binary number, a(n+1) has exactly n prime substrings. Proof: Evidently, a(1) = 1_2 has zero and a(2) = 10_2 has 1 prime substring. Let n > 1. Written in binary, a(n+1) is 101010101...01 (if n + 1 is odd) and is 101010101...10 (if n + 1 is even) with n + 1 digits. Only the 2- and 3-digits substrings 10_2 (=2) and 101_2 (=5) are prime substrings. All the other substrings are nonprime since every substring is a previous term and all terms unequal to 2 and 5 are nonprime. For even n + 1, the number of prime substrings equal to 2 = 10_2 is (n+1)/2, and the number of prime substrings equal to 5 = 101_2 is (n-1)/2, makes a sum of n. For odd n + 1 we get n/2 for both, the number of 2's and 5's prime substrings, in any case, the sum is n. (End)

%C A000975 Let s(k) be the length of the Collatz orbit of k, e.g. s(1) = 1, s(2) = 2, s(3) = 5. Then s(a(n)) = n+3 for n >= 3. Proof by induction: s(a(3)) = s(5) = 6 = 3+3. For odd n >= 5 we have s(a(n)) = s(4*a(n-2)+1) = s(12*a(n-2)+4)+1 = s(3*a(n-2)+1)+3 = s(a(n-2))+2 = (n-2)+3+2 = n+3, and for even n >= 4 this gives s(a(n)) = s(2*a(n-1)) = s(a(n-1))+1 = (n-1)+3+1 = n+3.

%C A000975 In binary form, because the sequence 10101_2... keeps repeating, one can represent a(n) = floor(0.(10)_2 * 2^n). Because 0.(10)_2 = 0.(10)_2 * 4 - 2, then 0.(10)_2 = 2/3.

%e A000975 a(4)=10 since 0001, 0011, 0010, 0110, 0111, 0101, 0100, 1100, 1101, 1111 are the 10 binary strings switching 0000 to 1111.
%e A000975 a(3) = 1 because "lrc" is the only way to tie a tie with 3 half turns, namely, pass the business end of the tie behind the standing part to the left, bring across the front to the right, then behind to the center. The final motion of tucking the loose end down the front behind the "lr" piece is not considered a "step".
%e A000975 a(4) = 2 because "lrlc" is the only way to tie a tie with 4 half turns. Note that since the number of moves is even, the first step is to go to the left in front of the tie, not behind it. This knot is the standard "four in hand", the most commonly known men's tie knot. By contrast, the second most well known tie knot, the Windsor, is represented by "lcrlcrlc".
