%C A000670 (End)
%C A000670 Unreduced denominators in convergent to log(2) = lim_{n->infinity} n*a(n-1)/a(n).
%C A000670 a(n) is congruent to a(n+(p-1)p^(h-1)) (mod p^h) for n >= h (see Barsky).
%C A000670 Stirling-Bernoulli transform of 1/(1-x^2). - _Paul Barry_, Apr 20 2005
%C A000670 This is the sequence of moments of the probability distribution of the number of tails before the first head in a sequence of fair coin tosses. The sequence of cumulants of the same probability distribution is A000629. That sequence is twice the result of deletion of the first term of this sequence. - Michael Hardy (hardy(AT)math.umn.edu), May 01 2005
%C A000670 With p(n) = the number of integer partitions of n, p(i) = the number of parts of the i-th partition of n, d(i) = the number of different parts of the i-th partition of n, p(j,i) = the j-th part of the i-th partition of n, m(i,j) = multiplicity of the j-th part of the i-th partition of n, one has: a(n) = Sum_{i=1..p(n)} (n!/(Product_{j=1..p(i)} p(i,j)!)) * (p(i)!/(Product_{j=1..d(i)} m(i,j)!)). - _Thomas Wieder_, May 18 2005
%C A000670 The number of chains among subsets of [n]. The summed term in the new formula is the number of such chains of length k. - Micha Hofri (hofri(AT)wpi.edu), Jul 01 2006
%C A000670 Occurs also as first column of a matrix-inversion occurring in a sum-of-like-powers problem. Consider the problem for any fixed natural number m>2 of finding solutions to the equation Sum_{k=1..n} k^m = (k+1)^m. Erdős conjectured that there are no solutions for n, m > 2. Let D be the matrix of differences of D[m,n] := Sum_{k=1..n} k^m - (k+1)^m. Then the generating functions for the rows of this matrix D constitute a set of polynomials in n (for varying n along columns) and the m-th polynomial defining the m-th row. Let GF_D be the matrix of the coefficients of this set of polynomials. Then the present sequence is the (unsigned) first column of GF_D^-1. - _Gottfried Helms_, Apr 01 2007
%C A000670 Assuming A = log(2), D is d/dx and f(x) = x/(exp(x)-1), we have a(n) = (n!/2*A^(n+1)) Sum_{k=0..n} (A^k/k!) D^n f(-A) which gives Wilf's asymptotic value when n tends to infinity. Equivalently, D^n f(-a) = 2*( A*a(n) - 2*a(n-1) ). - Martin Kochanski (mjk(AT)cardbox.com), May 10 2007
%C A000670 List partition transform (see A133314) of (1,-1,-1,-1,...). - _Tom Copeland_, Oct 24 2007
%C A000670 First column of A154921. - _Mats Granvik_, Jan 17 2009
%C A000670 A slightly more transparent interpretation of a(n) is as the number of 'factor sequences' of N for the case in which N is a product of n distinct primes. A factor sequence of N of length k is of the form 1 = x(1), x(2), ..., x(k) = N, where {x(i)} is an increasing sequence such that x(i) divides x(i+1), i=1,2,...,k-1. For example, N=70 has the 13 factor sequences {1,70}, {1,2,70}, {1,5,70}, {1,7,70}, {1,10,70}, {1,14,70}, {1,35,70}, {1,2,10,70}, {1,2,14,70}, {1,5,10,70}, {1,5,35,70}, {1,7,14,70}, {1,7,35,70}. - _Martin Griffiths_, Mar 25 2009
%C A000670 Starting (1, 3, 13, 75, ...) = row sums of triangle A163204. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Jul 23 2009
%C A000670 Equals double inverse binomial transform of A007047: (1, 3, 11, 51, ...). - _Gary W. Adamson_, Aug 04 2009
%C A000670 If f(x) = Sum_{n>=0} c(n)*x^n converges for every x, then Sum_{n>=0} f(n*x)/2^(n+1) = Sum_{n>=0} c(n)*a(n)*x^n. Example: Sum_{n>=0} exp(n*x)/2^(n+1) = Sum_{n>=0} a(n)*x^n/n! = 1/(2-exp(x)) = e.g.f. - _Miklos Kristof_, Nov 02 2009
%C A000670 Hankel transform is A091804. - _Paul Barry_, Mar 30 2010
%C A000670 It appears that the prime numbers greater than 3 in this sequence (13, 541, 47293, ...) are of the form 4n+1. - _Paul Muljadi_, Jan 28 2011
%C A000670 The Fi1 and Fi2 triangle sums of A028246 are given by the terms of this sequence. For the definitions of these triangle sums, see A180662. - _Johannes W. Meijer_, Apr 20 2011
%C A000670 The modified generating function A(x) = 1/(2-exp(x))-1 = x + 3*x^2/2! + 13*x^3/3! + ... satisfies the autonomous differential equation A' = 1 + 3*A + 2*A^2 with initial condition A(0) = 0. Applying [Bergeron et al., Theorem 1] leads to two combinatorial interpretations for this sequence: (A) a(n) gives the number of plane-increasing 0-1-2 trees on n vertices, where vertices of outdegree 1 come in 3 colors and vertices of outdegree 2 come in 2 colors. (B) a(n) gives the number of non-plane-increasing 0-1-2 trees on n vertices, where vertices of outdegree 1 come in 3 colors and vertices of outdegree 2 come in 4 colors. Examples are given below. - _Peter Bala_, Aug 31 2011
%C A000670 Starting with offset 1 = the eigensequence of A074909 (the beheaded Pascal's triangle), and row sums of triangle A208744. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Mar 05 2012
%C A000670 a(n) = number of words of length n on the alphabet of positive integers for which the letters appearing in the word form an initial segment of the positive integers. Example: a(2) = 3 counts 11, 12, 21. The map "record position of block containing i, 1<=i<=n" is a bijection from lists of sets on [n] to these words. (The lists of sets on [2] are 12, 1/2, 2/1.) - _David Callan_, Jun 24 2013
%C A000670 This sequence was the subject of one of the earliest uses of the database. _Don Knuth_, who had a computer printout of the database prior to the publication of the 1973 Handbook, wrote to _N. J. A. Sloane_ on May 18, 1970, saying: "I have just had my first real 'success' using your index of sequences, finding a sequence treated by Cayley that turns out to be identical to another (a priori quite different) sequence that came up in connection with computer sorting." A000670 is discussed in Exercise 3 of Section 5.3.1 of The Art of Computer Programming, Vol. 3, 1973. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Aug 21 2014
%C A000670 Ramanujan gives a method of finding a continued fraction of the solution x of an equation 1 = x + a2*x^2 + ... and uses log(2) as the solution of 1 = x + x^2/2 + x^3/6 + ... as an example giving the sequence of simplified convergents as 0/1, 1/1, 2/3, 9/13, 52/75, 375/541, ... of which the sequence of denominators is this sequence, while A052882 is the numerators. - _Michael Somos_, Jun 19 2015
%C A000670 For n>=1, a(n) is the number of Dyck paths (A000108) with (i) n+1 peaks (UD's), (ii) no UUDD's, and (iii) at least one valley vertex at every nonnegative height less than the height of the path. For example, a(2)=3 counts UDUDUD (of height 1 with 2 valley vertices at height 0), UDUUDUDD, UUDUDDUD. These paths correspond, under the "glove" or "accordion" bijection, to the ordered trees counted by Cayley in the 1859 reference, after a harmless pruning of the "long branches to a leaf" in Cayley's trees. (Cayley left the reader to infer the trees he was talking about from examples for small n and perhaps from his proof.) - _David Callan_, Jun 23 2015
%C A000670 From _David L. Harden_, Apr 09 2017: (Start)
%C A000670 Fix a set X and define two distance functions d,D on X to be metrically equivalent when d(x_1,y_1) <= d(x_2,y_2) iff D(x_1,y_1) <= D(x_2,y_2) for all x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 in X.
%C A000670 Now suppose that we fix a function f from unordered pairs of distinct elements of X to {1,...,n}. Then choose positive real numbers d_1 <= ... <= d_n such that d(x,y) = d_{f(x,y)}; the set of all possible choices of the d_i's makes this an n-parameter family of distance functions on X. (The simplest example of such a family occurs when n is a triangular number: When that happens, write n = (k  2). Then the set of all distance functions on X, when |X| = k, is such a family.) The number of such distance functions, up to metric equivalence, is a(n).
%C A000670 It is easy to see that an equivalence class of distance functions gives rise to a well-defined weak order on {d_1, ..., d_n}. To see that any weak order is realizable, choose distances from the set of integers {n-1, ..., 2n-2} so that the triangle inequality is automatically satisfied. (End)
%C A000670 a(n) is the number of rooted labeled forests on n nodes that avoid the patterns 213, 312, and 321. - _Kassie Archer_, Aug 30 2018
%C A000670 From _A.H.M. Smeets_, Nov 17 2018: (Start)
%C A000670 Also the number of semantic different assignments to n variables (x_1, ..., x_n) including simultaneous assignments. From the example given by Joerg Arndt (Mar 18 2014), this is easily seen by replacing
%C A000670 "{i}" by "x_i := expression_i(x_1, ..., x_n)",
%C A000670 "{i, j}" by "x_i, x_j := expression_i(x_1, .., x_n), expression_j(x_1, ..., x_n)", i.e., simultaneous assignment to two different variables (i <> j),
%C A000670 similar for simultaneous assignments to more variables, and
%C A000670 "<" by ";", i.e., the sequential constructor. These examples are directly related to "Number of ways n competitors can rank in a competition, allowing for the possibility of ties." in the first comment.
%C A000670 From this also the number of different mean definitions as obtained by iteration of n different mean functions on n initial values. Examples:
%C A000670 the AGM(x1,x2) = AGM(x2,x1) is represented by {arithmetic mean, geometric mean}, i.e., simultaneous assignment in any iteration step;
%C A000670 Archimedes's scheme (for Pi) is represented by {geometric mean} < {harmonic mean}, i.e., sequential assignment in any iteration step;
%C A000670 the geometric mean of two values can also be observed by {arithmetic mean, harmonic mean};
%C A000670 the AGHM (as defined in A319215) is represented by {arithmetic mean, geometric mean, harmonic mean}, i.e., simultaneous assignment, but there are 12 other semantic different ways to assign the values in an AGHM scheme.
%C A000670 By applying power means (also called Holder means) this can be extended to any value of n. (End)
%C A000670 Total number of faces of all dimensions in the permutohedron of order n. For example, the permutohedron of order 3 (a hexagon) has 6 vertices + 6 edges + 1 2-face = 13 faces, and the permutohedron of order 4 (a truncated octahedron) has 24 vertices + 36 edges + 14 2-faces + 1 3-face = 75 faces. A001003 is the analogous sequence for the associahedron. - _Noam Zeilberger_, Dec 08 2019
%C A000670 Number of odd multinomial coefficients N!/(a_1!*a_2!*...*a_k!). Here each a_i is positive, and Sum_{i} a_i = N (so 2^{N-1} multinomial coefficients in all), where N is any positive integer whose binary expansion has n 1's. - _Richard Stanley_, Apr 05 2022 (edited Oct 19 2022)
%C A000670 From _Peter Bala_, Jul 08 2022: (Start)
%C A000670 Conjecture: Let k be a positive integer. The sequence obtained by reducing a(n) modulo k is eventually periodic with the period dividing phi(k) = A000010(k). For example, modulo 16 we obtain the sequence [1, 1, 3, 13, 11, 13, 11, 13, 11, 13, ...], with an apparent period of 2 beginning at a(4). Cf. A354242.
%C A000670 More generally, we conjecture that the same property holds for integer sequences having an e.g.f. of the form G(exp(x) - 1), where G(x) is an integral power series. (End)
%C A000670 a(n) is the number of ways to form a permutation of [n] and then choose a subset of its descent set. - _Geoffrey Critzer_, Apr 29 2023

%F A000670 From _Peter Bala_, Jul 01 2009: (Start)
%F A000670 Analogy with the Bernoulli numbers.
%F A000670 We enlarge upon the above comment of M. Kochanski.
%F A000670 The Bernoulli polynomials B_n(x), n = 0,1,..., are given by the formula
%F A000670 (1)... B_n(x) := Sum_{k=0..n} binomial(n,k)*B(k)*x^(n-k),
%F A000670 where B(n) denotes the sequence of Bernoulli numbers B(0) = 1,
%F A000670 B(1) = -1/2, B(2) = 1/6, B(3) = 0, ....
%F A000670 By analogy, we associate with the present sequence an Appell sequence of polynomials {P_n(x)} n >= 0 defined by
%F A000670 (2)... P_n(x) := Sum_{k=0..n} binomial(n,k)*a(k)*x^(n-k).
%F A000670 These polynomials have similar properties to the Bernoulli polynomials.
%F A000670 The first few values are P_0(x) = 1, P_1(x) = x + 1,
%F A000670 P_2(x) = x^2 + 2*x + 3, P_3(x) = x^3 + 3*x^2 + 9*x + 13 and
%F A000670 P_4(x) = x^4 + 4*x^3 + 18*x^2 + 52*x + 75. See A154921 for the triangle of coefficients of these polynomials.
%F A000670 The e.g.f. for this polynomial sequence is
%F A000670 (3)... exp(x*t)/(2 - exp(t)) = 1 + (x + 1)*t + (x^2 + 2*x + 3)*t^2/2! + ....
%F A000670 The polynomials satisfy the difference equation
%F A000670 (4)... 2*P_n(x - 1) - P_n(x) = (x - 1)^n,
%F A000670 and so may be used to evaluate the weighted sums of powers of integers
%F A000670 (1/2)*1^m + (1/2)^2*2^m + (1/2)^3*3^m + ... + (1/2)^(n-1)*(n-1)^m
%F A000670 via the formula
%F A000670 (5)... Sum_{k=1..n-1} (1/2)^k*k^m = 2*P_m(0) - (1/2)^(n-1)*P_m(n),
%F A000670 analogous to the evaluation of the sums 1^m + 2^m + ... + (n-1)^m in terms of Bernoulli polynomials.
%F A000670 This last result can be generalized to
%F A000670 (6)... Sum_{k=1..n-1} (1/2)^k*(k+x)^m = 2*P_m(x)-(1/2)^(n-1)*P_m(x+n).
%F A000670 For more properties of the polynomials P_n(x), refer to A154921.
%F A000670 For further information on weighted sums of powers of integers and the associated polynomial sequences, see A162312.
%F A000670 The present sequence also occurs in the evaluation of another sum of powers of integers. Define
%F A000670 (7)... S_m(n) := Sum_{k=1..n-1} (1/2)^k*((n-k)*k)^m, m = 1,2,....
%F A000670 Then
%F A000670 (8)... S_m(n) = (-1)^m *[2*Q_m(-n) - (1/2)^(n-1)*Q_m(n)],
%F A000670 where Q_m(x) are polynomials in x given by
%F A000670 (9)... Q_m(x) = Sum_{k=0..m} a(m+k)*binomial(m,k)*x^(m-k).
%F A000670 The first few values are Q_1(x) = x + 3, Q_2(x) = 3*x^2 + 26*x + 75
%F A000670 and Q_3(x) = 13*x^3 + 225*x^2 + 1623*x + 4683.
%F A000670 For example, m = 2 gives
%F A000670 (10)... S_2(n) := Sum_{k=1..n-1} (1/2)^k*((n-k)*k)^2
%F A000670 = 2*(3*n^2 - 26*n + 75) - (1/2)^(n-1)*(3*n^2 + 26*n + 75).
