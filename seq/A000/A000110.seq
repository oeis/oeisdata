%N A000110 Bell or exponential numbers: number of ways to partition a set of n labeled elements.

%C A000110 a(n) = number of nonisomorphic colorings of a map consisting of a row of n+1 adjacent regions. Adjacent regions cannot have the same color. - _David W. Wilson_, Feb 22 2005
%C A000110 If an integer is squarefree and has n distinct prime factors then a(n) is the number of ways of writing it as a product of its divisors. - _Amarnath Murthy_, Apr 23 2001
%C A000110 Consider rooted trees of height at most 2. Letting each tree 'grow' into the next generation of n means we produce a new tree for every node which is either the root or at height 1, which gives the Bell numbers. - _Jon Perry_, Jul 23 2003
%C A000110 Begin with [1,1] and follow the rule that [1,k] -> [1,k+1] and [1,k] k times, e.g., [1,3] is transformed to [1,4], [1,3], [1,3], [1,3]. Then a(n) is the sum of all components: [1,1] = 2; [1,2], [1,1] = 5; [1,3], [1,2], [1,2], [1,2], [1,1] = 15; etc. - _Jon Perry_, Mar 05 2004
%C A000110 Number of distinct rhyme schemes for a poem of n lines: a rhyme scheme is a string of letters (e.g., 'abba') such that the leftmost letter is always 'a' and no letter may be greater than one more than the greatest letter to its left. Thus 'aac' is not valid since 'c' is more than one greater than 'a'. For example, a(3)=5 because there are 5 rhyme schemes: aaa, aab, aba, abb, abc; also see example by Neven Juric. - _Bill Blewett_, Mar 23 2004
%C A000110 In other words, number of length-n restricted growth strings (RGS) [s(0),s(1),...,s(n-1)] where s(0)=0 and s(k) <= 1 + max(prefix) for k >= 1, see example (cf. A080337 and A189845). - _Joerg Arndt_, Apr 30 2011
%C A000110 Number of partitions of {1, ..., n+1} into subsets of nonconsecutive integers, including the partition 1|2|...|n+1.

%C A000110 a(n) is the number of functions f from {1,...,n} to {1,...,n,n+1} that satisfy the following two conditions for all x in the domain: (1) f(x) > x; (2) f(x)=n+1 or f(f(x))=n+1. E.g., a(3)=5 because there are exactly five functions that satisfy the two conditions: f1={(1,4),(2,4),(3,4)}, f2={(1,4),(2,3),(3,4)}, f3={(1,3),(2,4),(3,4)}, f4={(1,2),(2,4),(3,4)} and f5={(1,3),(2,3),(3,4)}. - _Dennis P.

%C A000110 Number of asynchronic siteswap patterns of length n which have no zero-throws (i.e., contain no 0's) and whose number of orbits (in the sense given by Allen Knutson) is equal to the number of balls. E.g., for n=4, the condition is satisfied by the following 15 siteswaps: 4444, 4413, 4242, 4134, 4112, 3441, 2424, 1344, 2411, 1313, 1241, 2222, 3131, 1124, 1111. Also number of ways to choose n permutations from identity and cyclic permutations (1 2), (1 2 3), ..., (1 2 3 ... n) so that their composition is identity. For n=3 we get the following five: id o id o id, id o (1 2) o (1 2), (1 2) o id o (1 2), (1 2) o (1 2) o id, (1 2 3) o (1 2 3) o (1 2 3). (To see the bijection, look at Ehrenborg and Readdy paper.) - _Antti Karttunen_, May 01 2006
%C A000110 a(n) is the number of permutations on [n] in which a 3-2-1 (scattered) pattern occurs only as part of a 3-2-4-1 pattern. Example: a(3) = 5 counts all permutations on [3] except 321. See "Eigensequence for Composition" reference a(n) = number of permutation tableaux of size n (A000142) whose first row contains no 0's. Example: a(3)=5 counts {{}, {}, {}}, {{1}, {}}, {{1}, {0}}, {{1}, {1}}, {{1, 1}}. - _David Callan_, Oct 07 2006

%C A000110 The terms can also be computed with finite steps and precise integer arithmetic. Instead of exp(P)/exp(1) one can compute A = exp(P - I) where I is the identity-matrix of appropriate dimension since (P-I) is nilpotent to the order of its dimension. Then a(n)=A[n,1] where n is the row-index starting at 1. - _Gottfried Helms_, Apr 10 2007
%C A000110 When n is prime, a(n) == 2 (mod n), but the converse is not always true. Define a Bell pseudoprime to be a composite number n such that a(n) == 2 (mod n). W. F. Lunnon recently found the Bell pseudoprimes 21361 = 41*521 and C46 = 3*23*16218646893090134590535390526854205539989357 and conjectured that Bell pseudoprimes are extremely scarce. So the second Bell pseudoprime is unlikely to be known with certainty in the near future. I confirmed that 21361 is the first. - _David W. Wilson_, Aug 04 2007 and Sep 24 2007

%C A000110 From _Peter Bala_, Oct 19 2008: (Start)
%C A000110 Bell(n) is the number of n-pattern sequences [Cooper & Kennedy]. An n-pattern sequence is a sequence of integers (a_1,...,a_n) such that a_i = i or a_i = a_j for some j < i. For example, Bell(3) = 5 since the 3-pattern sequences are (1,1,1), (1,1,3), (1,2,1), (1,2,2) and (1,2,3).
%C A000110 Bell(n) is the number of sequences of positive integers (N_1,...,N_n) of length n such that N_1 = 1 and N_(i+1) <= 1 + max{j = 1..i} N_j for i >= 1 (see the comment by B. Blewett above). It is interesting to note that if we strengthen the latter condition to N_(i+1) <= 1 + N_i we get the Catalan numbers A000108 instead of the Bell numbers.

%C A000110 In fact it is not really an eigensequence of the Pascal matrix; rather the Pascal matrix acts on the sequence as a shift. It is an eigensequence (the unique eigensequence with eigenvalue 1) of the matrix derived from the Pascal matrix by adding at the top the row [1, 0, 0, 0 ...]. The binomial sum formula may be derived from the definition in terms of partitions: label any element X of a set S of N elements, and let X(k) be the number of subsets of S containing X with k elements. Since each subset has a unique coset, the number of partitions p(N) of S is given by p(N) = Sum_{k=1..N} (X(k) p(N-k)); trivially X(k) = N-1 choose k-1. - _Mason Bogue_, Mar 20 2015

%C A000110 Number of treeshelves avoiding pattern T231. See A278677 for definitions and examples. - _Sergey Kirgizov_, Dec 24 2016
%C A000110 Presumably this satisfies Benford's law, although the results in Hürlimann (2009) do not make this clear. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Feb 09 2017
%C A000110 a(n) = Sum(# of standard immaculate tableaux of shape m, m is a composition of n), where this sum is over all integer compositions m of n > 0. This formula is easily seen to hold by identifying standard immaculate tableaux of size n with set partitions of { 1, 2, ..., n }. For example, if we sum over integer compositions of 4 lexicographically, we see that 1+1+2+1+3+3+3+1 = 15 = A000110(4). - _John M. Campbell_, Jul 17 2017
%C A000110 a(n) is also the number of independent vertex sets (and vertex covers) in the (n-1)-triangular honeycomb bishop graph. - _Eric W. Weisstein_, Aug 10 2017
%C A000110 Even-numbered entries represent the numbers of configurations of identity and non-identity for alleles of a gene in n diploid individuals with distinguishable maternal and paternal alleles. - _Noah A Rosenberg_, Jan 28 2019
%C A000110 Number of partial equivalence relations (PERs) on a set with n elements (offset=1), i.e., number of symmetric, transitive (not necessarily reflexive) relations. The idea is to add a dummy element D to the set, and then take equivalence relations on the result; anything equivalent to D is then removed for the partial equivalence relation. - _David Spivak_, Feb 06 2019
%C A000110 Number of words of length n+1 with no repeated letters, when letters are unlabeled. - _Thomas Anton_, Mar 14 2019
%C A000110 Named by Becker and Riordan (1948) after the Scottish-American mathematician and writer Eric Temple Bell (1883 - 1960). - _Amiram Eldar_, Dec 04 2020
%C A000110 Also the number of partitions of {1,2,...,n+1} with at most one n+1 singleton. E.g., a(3)=5: {13|24, 12|34, 123|4, 14|23, 1234}. - _Yuchun Ji_, Dec 21 2020
%C A000110 a(n) is the number of sigma algebras on the set of n elements. Note that each sigma algebra is generated by a partition of the set. For example, the sigma algebra generated by the partition {{1}, {2}, {3,4}} is {{}, {1}, {2}, {1,2}, {3,4}, {1,3,4}, {2,3,4}, {1,2,3,4}}. - _Jianing Song_, Apr 01 2021
%C A000110 a(n) is the number of P_3-free graphs on n labeled nodes. - _M. Eren Kesim_, Jun 04 2021
%C A000110 a(n) is the number of functions X:([n] choose 2) -> {+,-} such that for any ordered 3-tuple abc we have X(ab)X(ac)X(bc) not in {+-+,++-,-++}. - _Robert Lauff_, Dec 09 2022
%C A000110 From _Manfred Boergens_, Mar 11 2025: (Start)
%C A000110 The partitions in the definition can be described as disjoint covers of the set. "Covers" in general give rise to the following amendments:
%C A000110 For disjoint covers which may include one empty set see A186021.
%C A000110 For arbitrary (including non-disjoint) covers see A003465.
%C A000110 For arbitrary (including non-disjoint) covers which may include one empty set see A000371. (End)
