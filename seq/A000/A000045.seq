%C A000045 D. E. Knuth writes: "Before Fibonacci wrote his work, the sequence F_{n} had already been discussed by Indian scholars, who had long been interested in rhythmic patterns that are formed from one-beat and two-beat notes. The number of such rhythms having n beats altogether is F_{n+1}; therefore both Gopāla (before 1135) and Hemachandra (c. 1150) mentioned the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ... explicitly."

%C A000045 Susantha Goonatilake writes: "[T]his sequence was well known in South Asia and used in the metrical sciences. Its development is attributed in part to Pingala (200 BC), later being associated with Virahanka (circa 700 AD), Gopala (circa 1135), and Hemachandra (circa 1150)—all of whom lived and worked prior to Fibonacci."

%C A000045 A result of Jacobi from 1848 states that every symmetric matrix over a p.i.d. is congruent to a triple-diagonal matrix. Consider the maximal number T(n) of summands in the determinant of an n X n triple-diagonal matrix. This is the same as the number of summands in such a determinant in which the main-, sub- and superdiagonal elements are all nonzero. By expanding on the first row we see that the sequence of T(n)'s is the Fibonacci sequence without the initial stammer on the 1's. - Larry Gerstein (gerstein(AT)math.ucsb.edu), Mar 30 2007
%C A000045 Suppose psi=log(phi). We get the representation F(n)=(2/sqrt(5))*sinh(n*psi) if n is even; F(n)=(2/sqrt(5))*cosh(n*psi) if n is odd. There is a similar representation for Lucas numbers (A000032). Many Fibonacci formulas now easily follow from appropriate sinh and cosh formulas. For example: the de Moivre theorem (cosh(x)+sinh(x))^m = cosh(mx)+sinh(mx) produces L(n)^2 + 5F(n)^2 = 2L(2n) and L(n)F(n) = F(2n) (setting x=n*psi and m=2). - _Hieronymus Fischer_, Apr 18 2007

%C A000045 F(n) is the number of possible binary sequences of length n that obey the sequential construction rule: if last symbol is 0, add the complement (1); else add 0 or 1. Here 0,1 are metasymbols for any 2-valued symbol set. This rule has obvious similarities to JFJ Laros's rule, but is based on addition rather than substitution and creates a tree rather than a single sequence. - _Ross Drewe_, Oct 05 2008

%C A000045 F(n+1) = number of Motzkin paths of length n having exactly one weak ascent. A Motzkin path of length n is a lattice path from (0,0) to (n,0) consisting of U=(1,1), D=(1,-1) and H=(1,0) steps and never going below the x-axis. A weak ascent in a Motzkin path is a maximal sequence of consecutive U and H steps. Example: a(5)=5 because we have (HHHH), (HHU)D, (HUH)D, (UHH)D, and (UU)DD (the unique weak ascent is shown between parentheses; see A114690). - _Emeric Deutsch_, Mar 11 2010

%C A000045 The relationship: INVERT transform of (1,1,0,0,0,...) = (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...), while the INVERT transform of (1,0,1,0,1,0,1,...) = (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...) is equivalent to: The numbers of compositions using parts 1 and 2 is equivalent to the numbers of compositions using parts == 1 (mod 2) (i.e., the odd integers). Generally, the numbers of compositions using parts 1 and k is equivalent to the numbers of compositions of (n+1) using parts 1 mod k. Cf. A000930 for k = 3 and A003269 for k = 4.

%C A000045 From _Russell Jay Hendel_, Apr 12 2015: (Start)
%C A000045 We prove Conjecture 1 of Rashid listed in the Formula section.
%C A000045 We use the following notation: F(n)=A000045(n), the Fibonacci numbers, and L(n) = A000032(n), the Lucas numbers. The fundamental Fibonacci-Lucas recursion asserts that G(n) = G(n-1) + G(n-2), with "L" or "F" replacing "G".
%C A000045 We need the following prerequisites which we label (A), (B), (C), (D). The prerequisites are formulas in the Koshy book listed in the References section. (A) F(m-1) + F(m+1) = L(m) (Koshy, p. 97, #32), (B) L(2m) + 2*(-1)^m = L(m)^2 (Koshy p. 97, #41), (C) F(m+k)*F(m-k) = (-1)^n*F(k)^2 (Koshy, p. 113, #24, Tagiuri's identity), and (D) F(n)^2 + F(n+1)^2 = F(2n+1) (Koshy, p. 97, #30).
%C A000045 We must also prove (E), L(n+2)*F(n-1) = F(2n+1)+2*(-1)^n. To prove (E), first note that by (A), proof of (E) is equivalent to proving that F(n+1)*F(n-1) + F(n+3)*F(n-1) = F(2n+1) + 2*(-1)^n. But by (C) with k=1, we have F(n+1)*F(n-1) = F(n)^2 + (-1)^n. Applying (C) again with k=2 and m=n+1, we have F(n+3)*F(n-1) = F(n+1) + (-1)^n. Adding these two applications of (C) together and using (D) we have F(n+1)*F(n-1) + F(n+3)*F(n-1) = F(n)^2 + F(n+1)^2 + 2*(-1)^n = F(2n+1) + 2(-1)^n, completing the proof of (E).
%C A000045 We now prove Conjecture 1. By (A) and the Fibonacci-Lucas recursion, we have F(2n+1) + F(2n+2) + F(2n+3) + F(2n+4) = (F(2n+1) + F(2n+3)) + (F(2n+2) + F(2n+4)) = L(2n+2) +L(2n+3) = L(2n+4). But then by (B), with m=2n+4, we have sqrt(L(2n+4) + 2(-1)^n) = L(n+2). Finally by (E), we have L(n+2)*F(n-1) = F(2n+1) + 2*(-1)^n. Dividing both sides by F(n-1), we have (F(2n+1) + 2*(-1)^n)/F(n-1) = L(n+2) = sqrt(F(2n+1) + F(2n+2) + F(2n+3) + F(2n+4) + 2(-1)^n), as required.

%C A000045 F(n+1) is the number of subsets of {1,2,.,.,n} in which all differences between successive elements of subsets are odd.

%C A000045 F(n) is the number of subsets of {1,2,...,n} in which the smallest element of the subset equals the size of the subset (this type of subset is sometimes called extraordinary).

It is easy to see that these subsets follow the Fibonacci recursion F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) since we get F(n) such subsets by keeping all F(n-1) subsets from the previous stage (in the example, the F(5)=5 subsets that don't include 6), and by adding one to all elements and appending an additional element n to each subset in F(n-2) subsets (in the example, by applying this to the F(4)=3 subsets {1}, {2,3}, {2,4} we obtain {2,6}, {3,4,6}, {3,5,6}). - _Enrique Navarrete_, Sep 28 2020

%e A000045 Partially ordered partitions of (n-1) into parts 1,2,3 where only the order of the adjacent 1's and 2's are unimportant. E.g., a(8)=21.

%e A000045 Consider the partitions of 7 with summands initially listed in nonincreasing order. Keep the 1's frozen in position (indicated by "[]") and then allow the other summands to otherwise vary their order: 7; 6,[1]; 5,2; 2,5; 4,3; 3,4; 5,[1,1], 4,2,[1]; 2,4,[1]; 3,3,[1]; 3,3,2; 3,2,3; 2,3,3; 4,[1,1,1]; 3,2,[1,1]; 2,3,[1,1]; 2,2,2,[1]; 3,[1,1,1,1]; 2,2,[1,1,1]; 2,[1,1,1,1,1]; [1,1,1,1,1,1,1].
