If we write A for a win by "team A" and B for a win by "team B" and if we list the played games chronologically from left to right then the six ways are AA, ABA, BAA, BB, BAB, and ABB.

For example, when n=5 and j=4, a(5)=252; 252*(2^5)^(4-2) = 252*1024 = 258048.  The self-convolved sequence which yields powers of 16 is {1, 8, 96, 1280, 17920, 258048, ...}; i.e., S(5) = 258048.

%C A000984 All binary self-dual codes of length 4n, for n>0, must contain at least a(n) codewords of weight 2n.  More to the point, there will always be at least one, perhaps unique, binary self-dual code of length 4n that will contain exactly a(n) codewords that have a hamming weight equal to half the length of the code (2n). This code can be constructed by direct summing the unique binary self-dual code of length 2 (up to permutation equivalence) to itself an even number of times.
