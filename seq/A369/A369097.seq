%N A369097 Numbers k >= 1 such that sigma(k) divides the difference between the pentagonal numbers P(k + 1) - P(k), where sigma(k) is the sum of the divisors of k.
%C A369097 k is a term if (3*(k+1)^2 - (k+1))/2 - (3*k^2-k)/2 = 3*k+1 is divisible by sigma(k).
%C A369097 If k is a term, except for k = 1, then 3*k+1 = 2*sigma(k).
%C A369097 Trivial case: Primes are not terms of this sequence because if k is prime, then sigma(k) = k+1 and k+1 does not divide (3*k+1).
%C A369097 The next term is > 10^9.
%C A369097 If 3^m - 2 is prime (i.e., m is a term of A014224), then 3^(m-1)*(3^m-2) is a term. - _Amiram Eldar_, Jan 13 2024
%e A369097 21 is a term since 3*21+1 = 64 is divisible by sigma( 21) = 32.
%e A369097 23 is not a term since 3*23+1 = 70 is not divisible by sigma(23) = 24.
%e A369097 2133 is a term since 3*2133+1 = 6400 is divisible by sigma(2133) = 3200.
%e A369097 2135 is not a term since 3*2135+1 = 6406 is not divisible by sigma(2135) = 2976.
