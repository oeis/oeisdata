%N A369650 Numbers k such that A003415(k) = A276085(k), where A003415 is the arithmetic derivative, and A276085 is the primorial base log-function.
%C A369650 Intersection with A048103 gives the fixed points (1, 2, 10, 15, 5005, ...) of A327859. Question: Does that set preclude numbers that are not squarefree (A371083)? Certainly it does not contain any multiples of 9. See also comments in A328110.
%C A369650 By considering the congruence A003415(k) == A276085(k) (mod 4), (see A392594), we deduce that any term of this sequence must either be (if it is odd) in A360110, or (if it is of the form 4m+2) in A017089 (which is the union of 2*A359161 and 2*A359151 = A369668), or if it is a multiple of 4, then in it must be one of the terms of 4*A373142. There are no terms of the form 8m+6 (A017137) in this sequence.
%C A369650 By considering known lower and upper bounds for arithmetic derivative, we know that this must be a subsequence of A392601.
%C A369650 By considering specific properties of A003415 and A276085, we conclude that if there are any terms of A371083 in this sequence, they must be included in A392592 (intersection of A391845 and A391866), and also in A392868, where the larger terms get noticeably more rare.

%e A369650 As 5005 = 5*7*11*13, A003415(5*7*11*13) = (5*7*11) + (5*7*13) + (5*11*13) + (7*11*13) = 2556 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 71 = A276085(5005) = A002110(2) + A002110(3) + A002110(4) + A002110(5) [as 5, 7, 11 and 13 are prime(3) .. prime(6)], therefore 5005 is included in this sequence.
