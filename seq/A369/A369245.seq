%N A369245 Number of representations of the n-th Euclid number, A002110(n) + 1, as a sum (p*q + p*r + q*r) with three odd primes p <= q <= r. (Definition implies that p=3 and q > 3).
%C A369245 Number of representations of the n-th Euclid number, A002110(n) + 1, as a sum of the form 3*(p+q) + p*q, where p and q are odd primes.
%C A369245 Question: Will there be an eventual growth spurt for this sequence? Even though all solutions must be multiples of 3 (but not of 9), because A006862(n) == 1 (mod 3), for n > 1, and the solutions belong to a set listed by A369461.
%C A369245 Similar sequence A369242 grows more vigorously because A033312(n) == -1 (mod 3) for n >= 3, thus allowing non-multiples of 3 as solutions. See comments in A369252.
%F A369245 a(n) = A369054(A006862(n)).
%e A369245 a(4) = 1 as there exists a natural number 399 = 3 * 7 * 19, whose arithmetic derivative (indicated with 399', see A003415) is computed as ((3*7) + (3*19) + (7*19)) = 211 = 1 + prime(4)# = A006862(4), and because 399 is the unique term in A046316 that satisfies the condition.
%e A369245 a(17) >= 1 because there exists (at least one) solution k = 4903038892893242229501 = 3 * 17 * 96138017507710631951 with A003415(k) = 1+A002110(17).
