%N A097811 Numbers n such that n^3 is the sum of three or more consecutive positive cubes.
%C A097811 These numbers were found by exhaustive search. The sums are not unique; for n=2856, there are two representations. The Mathematica code prints n, the range of cubes in the sum and the number of cubes in the sum. For instance, 82680^3 equals the sum of 6591 cubes! A faster program was used to check all sums s of consecutive cubes such that s < 2000000^3.
%C A097811 2856^3 is the only cube < 2*10^23 that is a sum in two different ways. 2856^3 = 213^3 +...+ 555^3 = 273^3 +...+ 560^3. - _Donovan Johnson_, Feb 22 2011
%C A097811 The terms of this sequence tend to contain only small primes. Is a(n)^(1/3) an upper bound for the largest prime factor of a(n)? - _Ralf Stephan_, May 22 2013
%C A097811 Note that by Fermat's theorem no cube is the sum of two positive cubes.
%C A097811 The cubes of the terms form a subsequence of A265845 (numbers that are sums of consecutive positive cubes in more than one way) which is sparse: among the first 1000 terms of A265845, only 17 are cubes. - _Jonathan Sondow_, Jan 10 2016

%e A097811 20 is in this sequence because 11^3 + 12^3 + 13^3 + 14^3 = 20^3.
