%N A215644 Full spectrum threshold for maximal determinant {+1, -1} matrices: largest order of submatrix for which the full spectrum of absolute determinant values occurs.
%C A215644 a(n) is the maximum of m(A) taken over all maximal determinant matrices A of order n, where m(A) is the maximum m such that the full spectrum of possible values (ignoring sign) occurs for the minors of order m of A.
%C A215644 We calculated the first 21 terms of the sequence by an exhaustive computation of minors of known maximal determinant matrices as at August 2012.

%e A215644 For n = 8 we have a(8) = 4 as a Hadamard matrix of order 8 has minors of order 4 with the full spectrum of values {0,8,16} (signs are ignored) but minors of order m > 4 do not have this property.
