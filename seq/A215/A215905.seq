%N A215905 Triangle read by rows in which row n contains the possible dimensions of unital *-subalgebras of the n X n complex matrices.
%C A215905 A *-subalgebra is a subalgebra (i.e., a subspace closed under matrix multiplication) that is closed under the conjugate transpose operation. A unital subalgebra is one that contains the identity matrix.
%C A215905 Every *-subalgebra of the n X n complex matrices is unitarily similar to a direct sum of full matrix algebras of smaller dimension, where elements of those full matrix algebras of the same dimension may or may not be forced to be identical.
%C A215905 As a result of the previous characterization, the possible dimensions of unital *-subalgebras of the n X n matrices are obtained by finding all partitions of n and summing the squares of the parts, possibly omitting some or all duplicated parts.
%C A215905 The first n entries of row n are 1, 2, ..., n. The smallest positive integer not contained in the n-th row is A215914(n).
%C A215905 The last entry of row n is A000290(n).
%C A215905 The 2nd-to-last entry of row n is A002522(n-1).
%C A215905 Row lengths are given by A215909.

%e A215905 When n = 3, there are five different (up to unitary similarity) unital *-subalgebras, which contain matrices of the following forms:
%e A215905 a 0 0 ... a 0 0 ... a 0 0 ... a b 0 ... a b c
%e A215905 0 a 0 ... 0 b 0 ... 0 b 0 ... c d 0 ... d e f
%e A215905 0 0 a ... 0 0 b ... 0 0 c ... 0 0 e ... g h i
%e A215905 The above *-subalgebras have dimensions 1, 2, 3, 5, and 9, which is the 3rd row of the triangle.
%e A215905 When n = 4, we can compute the possible dimension by finding all partitions of 4 = 3 + 1 = 2 + 2 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1. Then the possible dimensions are 4^2 = 16, 3^2 + 1^2 = 10, 2^2 + 2^2 = 8, 2^2 = 4, 2^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 6, 2^2 + 1^2 = 5, 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 4, 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3, 1^2 + 1^2 = 2, and 1^2 = 1, which are the entries of the 4th row.
