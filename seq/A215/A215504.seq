%N A215504 Prime numbers p such that p^2 - 1 has exactly one distinct prime factor other than 2 and 3.
%C A215504 a) Only primes 2, 3, 5, 7 and 17 are known with the property that p^2 - 1 has no prime factors other than 2 and/or 3.
%C A215504 b) These prime numbers have p+-1 in the form of 2^m*3^n and 2^j*q^k respectively, where q is a prime number other than 2 and 3.
%C A215504 c) Up to the 100000000th prime number (2038074743), first 30 terms were confirmed using first mathematica program.
%C A215504 d) Based on comment b), the second mathematica program checked up to the 12000th term of A003586, 54 terms were found.
%C A215504 e) So far only 97 and 577 have their prime factor repeated.
%C A215504 Item b) above is false for members 31 = 2^5-1; 127 = 2^7-1; and 257 = 2^8+1. Here one of the neighbors to p is of form 2^m, and the other one is of form 2*3^j*q^k. Call such members exceptional terms. The exceptional terms constitute the only difference between this sequence and A284037. The exceptional terms are either Fermat primes (A019434) or Mersenne primes (A000668). - _Jeppe Stig Nielsen_, Dec 01 2020

%e A215504 For any primes less than 11, p^2 - 1 does not have factors other than 2 or 3.
%e A215504 11^2 - 1 = 120 = 2^3*3*5, 5 is the only prime factor other than 2 and 3, so a(1) = 11;
%e A215504 13^2 - 1 = 168 = 2^3*3*5, so a(2) = 13;
%e A215504 17^2 - 1 = 288 = 2^5*3^2, so 17 is a not a term;
%e A215504 19^2 - 1 = 360 = 2^3*3^2*5, so a(3) = 19.
%e A215504 97^2 - 1 = 9408 = 2^6 * 3 * 7^2 which shows the other prime (7 here) can have multiplicity > 1. - _David A. Corneth_, Dec 21 2020
