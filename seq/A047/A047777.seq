%N A047777 Primes seen in the decimal expansion of Pi (disregarding the decimal point) that are contiguous, smallest and distinct.
%C A047777 Sequence A121267 gives the number of digits of a(n) [but see also A229181 for a variant, cf. below]. The terms a(9)-a(11) had been found by Chris Nash in October 1999, and primality of the 3057-digit term a(9) has been proved in September 2002 by J. K. Andersen, who also found the next 5 terms a(12)-a(16) and the bound a(17) > 10^32000, cf. Rivera's web page "Problem 18". - _M. F. Hasler_, Aug 31 2013
%C A047777 There is a natural variant of the present sequence, using the same definition except for not requiring that all primes have to be distinct. That variant would have the same 3057-digit prime as next term a(9), and therefore have the same displayed terms and not justify a separate entry in the OEIS. However, terms beyond a(9) would be different: instead of a(10) = 73, a(11) = 467 and the 14650-digit PRP a(11), it would be followed by a'(10) = 7, a'(11) = 3 (which cuts a(10) = 73 in two pieces), a'(12) = 467, a'(13) = a'(14) = 2, and a'(15) equal to a 748-digit prime, see the a-file from J.-F. Alcover. Sequence A229181 lists the size of these terms. - _M. F. Hasler_, Sep 15 2013, updated Jan 18 2019

%e A047777 The first digit of Pi = 3.14159... is the prime 3, therefore a(1) = 3.
%e A047777 We discard this digit 3, and look for the first time a chunk of subsequent digits (always starting with the 1 coming right after the previously used 3) would be prime: 1, 14, 141, 1415 are not, but 14159 is. (The single-digit prime '5' was not considered, because we require the primes made from the whole contiguous chunk of digits starting after the previously found prime.) Thus, a(2) = 14159.
%e A047777 Thereafter, we have the single-digit prime a(3) = 2, and then a(4) = 653 (since neither 6 nor 65 is prime). - _M. F. Hasler_, Jan 18 2019
