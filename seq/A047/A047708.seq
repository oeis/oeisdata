%N A047708 Diagonal of Sprague-Grundy function for Wyt Queens (Wythoff's game).
%C A047708 Since Wythoff(m,n) <= m+n, Wythoff(n,n) <= 2n. It is not known whether there is an efficient (linear in log(m)+log(n)) strategy to compute Wythoff(m,n). Each single row is "easy" in the sense that a+n-Wythoff(a,n) is eventually periodic. - _Howard A. Landman_.
%C A047708 Inverse of sequence A048850 considered as a permutation of the nonnegative integers. - _Howard A. Landman_, Sep 25 2001
%C A047708 Comments from _Howard A. Landman_, Nov 24 2007: (Start)
%C A047708 It is impossible for any integer to appear twice in this sequence because of the way it is constructed. Thus to prove that it is a permutation of the integers, we need only show that every value g appears at least once.
%C A047708 Suppose this were not true; then there must be some g such that for any value of n, G(n,n) is not = g. Since G(n,n) is defined to be the smallest number not found as a G(k,n), G(n,k), or G(k,k) for k < n, this can only happen in one of 2 ways: either there is a number g' smaller than g which is chosen (this can occur at most g times) or g already appears as both G(n,k) and G(k,n) for some k < n (because G(n,k) = G(k,n)) (this can happen at most n/2 times).
%C A047708 Thus we have n <= n/2 + g, or n <= 2g; if g has not appeared within the first 2g terms we have a contradiction. Therefore not only must every integer g appear in the sequence, but it must appear within the first 2g terms (and no sooner than term g/2, since G(n,n) <= 2n). Conversely, this also proves that n/2 <= A(n) = G(n,n) <= 2n. (End)
