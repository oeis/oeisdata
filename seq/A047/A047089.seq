%N A047089 Array T read by antidiagonals: T(h,k)=number of paths consisting of steps from (0,0) to (h,k) such that each step has length 1 directed up or right and touches the line y=x/2 only at lattice points.
%C A047089 Comments from Timothy Y. Chow (tchow(AT)alum.mit.edu), Nov 15 2006 on this sequence and A107027. "If you replace "the line y = x/2" with "the line y = x/(n-1)" in the definition of this sequence, then the formula for T(h,k) becomes (h+k choose k) - (n-1)*(h+k choose k-1).
%C A047089 "As for A107027, it has a combinatorial interpretation: T(n,k) is the number of paths of length n*k such that each step has length 1 directed up or right and touches the line y = x/(n-1) only at lattice points.
%C A047089 "To see this, let us avoid notational confusion by replacing the "k" in A047089 by "j". Then the formula above becomes (h+j choose j) - (n-1)*(h+j choose j-1).
%C A047089 "If we sum over all the points at a distance n*k from (0,0) - i.e. if we sum from j=0 to j=k and let h = n*k-j - then we get (n*k choose k) - (n-2) * sum_{j=0}^{k-1} (n*k choose j) This is equivalent to the formula you report for A107027."
