%N A292592 a(n) = A292590(A245612(n)).
%C A292592 Because A292590(n) =  a(A245611(n)), the sequence works as a "masking function" where the 1-bits in a(n) (always a subset of the 1-bits in binary expansion of n) indicate which numbers are multiples of 3 in binary tree A245612 on that trajectory which leads from the root of the tree to the node containing A245612(n). See the examples.

%F A292592 a(n) + A292593(n) = n, a(n) AND A292593(n) = 0.
%F A292592 a(n) AND n = a(n), where AND is bitwise-AND (A004198).
%e A292592 A245612(18) = 188, that is, at "node address" 18 in binary tree A245612 sits number 188. 18 in binary is "10010", which when read from left to right (after the most significant bit which is always 1) gives the directions to follow in the tree when starting from the root, to land in node containing number 188. Here, after 1 and 2, turn left from 2, turn left from 5, turn right from 14 and then turn left from 63 and then indeed one lands in 188. These turns correspond with the four lowermost bits of the code, "0010". When one selects multiples of 3 from this path 1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 14 -> 63 -> 188, the only one is 63, which corresponds with the second rightmost bit (which also is the only 1-bit) in the code, which can be masked with 2 (binary "10"), thus a(18) = 2.
%e A292592 A245612(15) = 6, that is, at "node address" 15 in binary tree A245612 sits number 6. 15 in binary is "1111", which tells that 6 can be located in tree A245612 by going (after the initial root 1 and 2) three steps towards right from 2: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6. Of these numbers, only 3 and 6 are multiples of 3, thus the mask to obtain the corresponding bits from "1111" is "00101" (5 in binary), thus a(15) = 5.
%e A292592 A245612(31) = 7, that is, at "node address" 31 in binary tree A245612 sits number 7. 31 in binary is "11111", which tells that 7 can be located in tree A245612 by going (after the initial root 1 and 2) four steps towards right from 2: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 7. Of these numbers, only 3 and 6 are multiples of 3, thus the mask to obtain the corresponding bits from "11111" is "001010" (ten in binary), thus a(31) = 10.
