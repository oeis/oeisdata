%C A292254 Because A292253(n) = a(A243071(n)), the sequence works as a "masking function" where the 1-bits in a(n) (always a subset of the 1-bits in binary expansion of n) indicate the numbers that are either of the form 12k+1 or of the form 12k+11 in binary tree A163511 (or its mirror image tree A005940) on that trajectory which leads from the root of the tree to the node containing A163511(n).
%C A292254 The AND - XOR formula just restates the fact that J(3|n) = J(-1|n)*J(-3|n), as the Jacobi-symbol is multiplicative (also) with respect to its upper argument.

%F A292254 a(n) = A292264(n) AND (A292274(n) XOR A292942(n)), where AND is bitwise-and (A004198) and XOR is bitwise-XOR (A003987). [See comments.]
