%N A292672 Least number of symbols required to fill a grid of size n X n row by row in the greedy way such that in any row or column or rectangular 2 X 2 block no symbol occurs twice.
%C A292672 Consider the symbols as positive integers. By the greedy way we mean to fill the grid row by row from left to right always with the least possible positive integer such that the three constraints (on rows, columns and rectangular blocks) are satisfied.
%C A292672 In contrast to the sudoku case, the 2 X 2 rectangles have "floating" borders, so the constraint is actually equivalent to saying that any element must be different from all neighbors in a Moore neighborhood of range 1 (having up to 3*3=9 grid points).

%e A292672 For n = 4, the 4 X 4 grid is filled as follows:
%e A292672    [1 2 3 4]
%e A292672    [3 4 1 2]
%e A292672    [2 5 6 3]
%e A292672    [4 1 2 5], whence a(4) = 6.
%e A292672 For n = 3 the result would be the upper 3 X 3 part of the above grid, showing that also a(3) = 6.
%o A292672 (PARI) a(n,m=2,g=matrix(n,n))={my(ok(g,k,i,j,m)=if(m,ok(g[i,],k)&&ok(g[,j],k)&&ok(concat(Vec(g[max(1,i-m+1)..i,max(1,j-m+1)..min(#g,j+m-1)])),k),!setsearch(Set(g),k))); for(i=1,n,for(j=1,n,for(k=1,n^2,ok(g,k,i,j,m)&&(g[i,j]=k)&&break)));vecmax(g)} \\ without "vecmax" the program returns the full n X n board.
