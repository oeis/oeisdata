%N A326834 a(0) = 0; a(1) = 0; for n > 0, a(n) = the sum of the number of times each digit in a(n-1) has occurred from a(0) to a(n-2) inclusive.
%C A326834 This sequence sums the previous digits the same way as A309261, except that here digits in a(n-1) are not considered unique, so each digit in a(n-1) is summed regardless of the number of times it appears in a(n-1). This leads to this sequence being the same as A309261 up to a(66) = 22, after which they diverge.
