%N A326404 Triangle T(n,k) read by rows: T(n,k) = number of ways of seating n people around a table for the second time so that k pairs are maintained. Rotated sequences are counted as one.
%C A326404 Definition requires "pairs" and for n=0 it is assumed that there is 1 way of seating 0 people around a table for the second time so that 0 pairs are maintained and 1 person forms only one pair with him/herself. Therefore T(0,0)=1, T(1,0)=0 and T(1,1)=1.
%C A326404 Sum of row n is equal (n-1)! for n > 1.
%C A326404 Weighted average of each row using k as weights converges to 2 for large n and is given with following formula: (Sum_{k} T(n,k)*k)/(Sum_{k} T(n,k)) = 2/(n-1) + 2 (conjectured).

%e A326404 Assuming the initial order was {1,2,3,4,5} (therefore 1 and 5 form a pair as the first and last persons are neighbors in the case of a round table) there are 5 sets of ways of seating them again so that 3 pairs are conserved: {1,2,3,5,4}, {2,3,4,1,5}, {3,4,5,2,1}, {4,5,1,3,2}, {5,1,2,4,3}. Since within each set we do not allow for circular symmetry (e.g., {1,2,3,5,4} and its rotation to form {2,3,5,4,1} are counted as one) but we allow reflection ({1,2,3,5,4} and {4,5,3,2,1} are considered distinct), the total number of ways is 5*2 and therefore T(5,3)=10.
