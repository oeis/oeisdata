%N A326309 Ordered perimeters p of primitive Pythagorean triangles having short leg in common with the long leg or hypotenuse of a primitive Pythagorean triangle with perimeter < p, and also having both the long leg and the hypotenuse in common with the short legs of primitive Pythagorean triangles with perimeter > p.
%C A326309 The short leg of a primitive Pythagorean triangle of perimeter a(n) is either the long leg or hypotenuse of a triangle whose perimeter is less than a(n).
%C A326309 The long leg and the hypotenuse of a triangle with perimeter a(n) are the short legs of triangles with perimeter greater than a(n).
%C A326309 This sequence is a subsequence of A024364. A subsequence of this sequence exists after applying the restrictions imposed by the sequence title to the sequence itself and begins a(2), a(3), a(9), a(11), ... . Applying the same restrictions on {a(2), a(3), a(9), a(11), ...} gives a sequence a(9), a(11), a(22), a(25), ... .
%C A326309 Question: Does recursive application of this sequence to A024364 terminate?
%e A326309 30 is a term because 30 = 5+12+13 and 12 = 3+4+5 and 84 = 12+35+37 and 182 = 13+84+85.
%e A326309 84 is a term because 84 = 12+35+37 and 30 = 5+12+13 and 1260 = 35+612+613 and 1406 = 37+684+685.
%e A326309 182 is a term because 182 = 13+84+85 and 30 = 5+12+13 and 476 = 84+187+205 and 374 = 85+132+157.
