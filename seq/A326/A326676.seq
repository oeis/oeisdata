%N A326676 Triangular array: T(n,k) equals the number of n triangle stacks of large Schröder type with k down-triangles in the bottom row of the stack.
%C A326676 We define two types of plane triangles of unit area - up-triangles with vertices at the lattice points (x, y), (x+1, y+1) and (x+2, y) and down-triangles with vertices at the lattice points (x, y), (x-1, y+1) and (x+1, y+1).
%C A326676 To construct a triangle stack of large Schröder type we start with a horizontal row of k contiguous down-triangles forming the base row of the stack. Subsequent rows of the stack are formed by placing up-triangles on some, all or none of the down-triangles of the previous row. In the spaces between pairs of adjacent up-triangles further down-triangles may be placed. For an example, see the illustration in the Links section. There is an obvious bijective correspondence between triangle stacks of large Schröder type with a base of k down-triangles and large Schröder paths of semilength k. For another version of this array see A129179.
%C A326676 For triangle stacks of small Schröder type, where the base row consists of contiguous up-triangles, see A224704.
