%N A326897 Prime numbers p such that 0 < pi(p;10,(9,1)) = pi(p;10,(3,9)) where pi(x;q,(a,b)) is the number of primes p_n <= x such that p_n == a (mod q) and p_(n+1) == b (mod q).
%C A326897 The counting function pi(x;q,(a,b)) is defined by Lemke Oliver and Soundararajan to be the number of primes p_n <= x such that p_n == a (mod q) and p_(n+1) == b (mod q).
%C A326897 Note that it is known that assertions like pi(x;3,1) < pi(x;3,2) or pi(x;4,1) < pi(x;4,3) ("Chebychev's biases") are false infinitely often.
%C A326897 Lemke Oliver and Soundararajan conjectured that pi(x;3,(1,1)) < pi(x,3,(1,2)) and pi(x;4,(1,1)) < pi(x;4,(1,3)) are robust biases, i.e., they always hold.
%C A326897 Here we conjecture that pi(x;10,(9,1)) > pi(x;10,(3,9)) is a semi- robust bias, i.e., it holds from a certain value x_0 on. Here x_0 is conjectured to be 48539. This conjecture seems to be confirmed by the observation that pi(x;10,(9,1)) - pi(x;10,(3,9)) ~ (Li(x)/16) * (1/2) * log(2*Pi/5*log(x)) / log(x).

%e A326897 First prime p such that (p,p') == (9,1) (mod 10) is for p = 29.
%e A326897 First prime q such that (q,q') == (3,9) (mod 10) is for q = 23.
%e A326897 So pi(x;10,(9,1)) = pi(x;10,(3,9)) > 0 first occurs for x = 29, so a(1) = 29.
