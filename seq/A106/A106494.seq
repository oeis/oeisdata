%e A106494 a(64) = 5, as 64 = A048723(2,6) = A048723(2,(A048723(2,1) X A048723(3,1))) and there are five nodes in that superfactorization. Similarly, for 27 = 5x7 = A048723(3, A048723(2,1)) X A048273(7,1) we get a(27) = 5. The operation X stands for GF(2)[X] multiplication defined in A048720, while A048723(n,y) raises the n-th GF(2)[X] polynomial to the y:th power.
%Y A106494 a(n) = A106491(A106445(n)). a(n) = A106493(n)+A106495(n).
