%N A106445 Exponent-recursed cross-domain bijection from GF(2)[X] to N. Variant of A091203 and A106443.
%C A106445 This map from the multiplicative domain of GF(2)[X] to that of N preserves 'superfactorized' structures, e.g. A106493(n) = A106490(a(n)), A106494(n) = A106491(a(n)), A106495(n) = A064372(a(n)). Shares with A091203 and A106443 the property that maps A014580(n) to A000040(n). Differs from the plain variant A091203 for the first time at n=32, where A091203(32)=32, while a(32)=512. Differs from the variant A106443 for the first time at n=48, where A106443(48)=768, while a(48)=48. Differs from a yet deeper variant A106447 for the first time at n=13, where A106447(13)=23, while a(13)=11.

%F A106445 a(0)=0, a(1)=1. For irreducible GF(2)[X] polynomials ir_i with index i (i.e. A014580(i)), a(ir_i) = A000040(i) and for composite polynomials n = A048723(ir_i, e_i) X A048723(ir_j, e_j) X A048723(ir_k, e_k) X ..., a(n) = a(ir_i)^a(e_i) * a(ir_j)^a(e_j) * a(ir_k)^a(e_k) * ... = A000040(i)^a(e_i) * A000040(j)^a(e_j) * A000040(k)^a(e_k), where X stands for carryless multiplication of GF(2)[X] polynomials (A048720) and A048723(n, y) raises the n-th GF(2)[X] polynomial to the y:th power, while * is the ordinary multiplication and ^ is the ordinary exponentiation.
%e A106445 a(5) = 9, as 5 encodes the GF(2)[X] polynomial x^2+1, which is the square of the second irreducible GF(2)[X] polynomial x+1 (encoded as 3) and the square of the second prime is 3^2=9. a(32) = a(A048723(2,5)) = 2^a(5) = 2^9 = 512. a(48) = a(3 X A048723(2,4)) = 3 * 2^a(4) = 3 * 2^4 = 3 * 16 = 48.
