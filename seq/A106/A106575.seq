%N A106575 Perfect squares which are both the sum and the difference of two primes.
%C A106575 Equals A106548 with 0's removed.
%C A106575 Appears to contain all even squares.
%C A106575 By well-known conjectures, every even integer > 2 is both the sum and the difference of two primes; this would be a special case. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Sep 13 2015
%e A106575 2^2 = 4 is in the sequence because it is the sum of two primes (2+2) and the difference of two primes (7-3). 10^2 = 100 is in the sequence because it is the sum and the difference of two primes: 97+3 (or 89+11) and 103-3. 11^2 = 121 is not in the sequence because it is neither the sum nor the difference of two primes. 13^2 = 169 is the sum of two primes (167+2), but it doesn't figure here since it is not the difference of two primes.
