%N A106252 Number of positive integer triples (x,y,z), with x<=y<=z<=n, such that each of x,y and z divides the sum of the other two.
%C A106252 The following conjecture is probably not very difficult: Conjecture. The sequence (A106253) of differences of this sequence is periodic with period 6.
%C A106252 That the difference sequence in the above conjecture is periodic follows from a formula in the Formula and Mathematica sections; see A211701 for a discussion. [_Clark Kimberling_, Apr 20 2012]

%F A106252 a(n) = n + floor(n/2) + floor(n/3). [_Clark Kimberling_, Apr 20 2012]
%e A106252 (1,1,1), (1,1,2), (1,2,3), (2,2,2) and (3,3,3) are the triples that have the desired property for n=3, so a(3)=5.
