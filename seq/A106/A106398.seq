%N A106398 Binomial transform of denominators in a Zeta function.
%C A106398 The formula 1/Zeta(s) = 1 - 1/2^s - 1/3^s - 1/5^s + 1/6^s is shown on p. 249 of Derbyshire and relies upon strategies pioneered by Euler.

%F A106398 Given 1/Zeta(s) = 1 - 1/2^s - 1/3^s - 1/5^s + 1/6^s - 1/7^s + 1/10^s - 1/11^s ..., we apply the binomial transform to the terms [1, -2, -3, -5, 6, -7, 10, -11, -13, 14, 15, -17, -19, 21, ...], which is the set of squarefree numbers (A005117), along with the Mobius function of each term.
%e A106398 The terms 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, ... = A005117, squarefree numbers. Applying the Mobius function rules to each of these, we get 1, -2, -3, -5, 6, .... The Mobius function rules are:
%e A106398 Given the domain N, the natural numbers 1,2,3,...,
%e A106398 Mu(1) = 1; Mu(n) of N = 0 if n has a square factor; Mu(n) = -1 if n is a prime or the product of an odd number of different primes; Mu(n) = 1 if n is the product of an even numbers of different primes.
