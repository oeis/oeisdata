%N A106377 Real part of Gaussian prime numbers such that the Gaussian primorial product up to them is a Gaussian prime minus one.
%C A106377 Consider the Gaussian primes of the first quadrant a+bi, with a > 0, b >= 0, ordered as a sequence by the size of the norm and the size of the real part a, as defined in A103431. The product of these primes up to a+bi, written here as cp#, may have the property that cp#+1 is a Gaussian prime. a(n) is the real part a of such a+bi. cp#+1 is not necessarily in the first quadrant.
%C A106377 From _R. J. Mathar_, Jun 13 2011: (Start)
%C A106377 Consider the partial products of the complex sequence A103431(n)+A103432(n)*i, which starts p# = 1+i, -1+3i, -5+5i, -15+15i, -75-15i, -195-195i, 585-975i, 3315-3315i, ... If 1+p# is a Gaussian prime, we insert the real part of the last factor, A103431(n), into this sequence. The first missing element is A103431(6), meaning -194-195i is not a Gaussian prime.
%C A106377 The 7 is for products up to norm 192, the 1 for products up to 256, the 10 for 268, 19 up to 360 and the 25 up to 820. (No further up to norm 5700. Is the sequence finite?) (End)

%e A106377 (1+i)*(1+2i)*(2+i)*3*(2+3i) + 1 = (-75-15i) + 1 = (-74-15i), which is a Gaussian prime. This is the 5th number with the property, so a(5) = 2.
